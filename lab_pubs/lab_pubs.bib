	abstract = {Background:

A team approach is one of the most effective ways to lower blood pressure ({BP}) in uncontrolled hypertension, but different models for organizing team-based care have not been compared directly.

Methods:

A pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial compared 2 interventions in adult patients with moderately severe hypertension ({BP}≥150/95 mm Hg): (1) clinic-based care using best practices and face-to-face visits with physicians and medical assistants; and (2) telehealth care using best practices and adding home {BP} telemonitoring with home-based care coordinated by a clinical pharmacist or nurse practitioner. The primary outcome was change in systolic {BP} over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were change in patient-reported outcomes over 6 months.

Results:

Participants (N=3071 in 21 primary care clinics) were on average 60 years old, 47\% male, and 19\% Black. Protocol-specified follow-up within 6 weeks was 32\% in clinic-based care and 27\% in telehealth care. {BP} decreased significantly during 12 months of follow-up in both groups, from 157/92 to 139/82 mm Hg in clinic-based care patients (adjusted mean difference −18/−10 mm Hg) and 157/91 to 139/81 mm Hg in telehealth care patients (adjusted mean difference −19/−10 mm Hg), with no significant difference in systolic {BP} change between groups (−0.8 mm Hg [95\% {CI}, −2.84 to 1.32]). Telehealth care patients were significantly more likely than clinic-based care patients to report frequent home {BP} measurement, rate their {BP} care highly, and report that {BP} care visits were convenient.

Conclusions:

Telehealth care that includes extended team care is an effective and safe alternative to clinic-based care for improving patient-centered care for hypertension.

	abstract = {Background: Identifying fall-related injuries and costs using healthcare claims data is cost-effective and easier to implement than using medical records or patient self-report to track falls. We developed a comprehensive four-step algorithm for identifying episodes of care for fall-related injuries and associated costs, using fee-for-service Medicare and Medicare Advantage health plan claims data for 2,011 patients from 5 medical groups between 2005 and 2009. Methods: First, as a preparatory step, we identified care received in acute inpatient and skilled nursing facility settings, in addition to emergency department visits. Second, based on diagnosis and procedure codes, we identified all fall-related claim records. Third, with these records, we identified six types of encounters for fall-related injuries, with different levels of injury and care. In the final step, we used these encounters to identify episodes of care for fall-related injuries. Results: To illustrate the algorithm, we present a representative example of a fall episode and examine descriptive statistics of injuries and costs for such episodes. Altogether, we found that the results support the use of our algorithm for identifying episodes of care for fall-related injuries. When we decomposed an episode, we found that the details present a realistic and coherent story of fall-related injuries and healthcare services. Variation of episode characteristics across medical groups supported the use of a complex algorithm approach, and descriptive statistics on the proportion, duration, and cost of episodes by healthcare services and injuries verified that our results are consistent with other studies. Conclusions: This algorithm can be used to identify and analyze various types of fall-related outcomes including episodes of care, injuries, and associated costs. Furthermore, the algorithm can be applied and adopted in other fall-related studies with relative ease.

Accurate patient information can assist clinicians with patient management and in allocating finite resources. However, systems currently in common use have limited predictive value in the clinical setting. The increasing availability of Electronic Health Records ({EHR}) provides an opportunity to use medical information for more accurate patient stability and mortality prediction in the {ICU}. {OBJECTIVE}: Develop and evaluate an algorithm which more accurately predicts patient mortality in the {ICU}, using the correlations between widely available clinical variables from the {EHR}. {METHODS}: We have developed an algorithm, {AutoTriage}, which uses eight common clinical variables from the {EHR} to assign patient mortality risk scores. Each clinical variable produces a subscore, and combinations of two or three discretized clinical variables also produce subscores. A combination of weighted subscores produces the overall score. We validated the performance of this algorithm in a retrospective study on the {MIMIC} {III} medical {ICU} dataset. {RESULTS}: {AutoTriage} 12 h mortality prediction yields an Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic value of 0.88 (95\% confidence interval 0.86 to 0.88). At a sensitivity of 80\%, {AutoTriage} maintains a specificity of 81\% with a diagnostic odds ratio of 16.26. {CONCLUSIONS}: Through the multidimensional analysis of the correlations between eight common clinical variables, {AutoTriage} provides an improvement in the specificity and sensitivity of patient mortality prediction over existing prediction methods.},

	abstract = {In order to explore a priori hypotheses about drug-induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome ({SJS}), a case-control study was initiated using data from {COMPASS}, a computerized data base consisting of Medicaid claims data. The records of 3.8 million patients in five U.S. states were searched to identify patients with an inpatient diagnosis of {ICD}-9-{CM} code 695.1 (erythema multiforme-{EM}). Out of the total of 367 cases that were identified, primary medical records for 249 were sought and 128 (51.4 per cent) of these were obtained. The remainder could not be obtained because: in 36 (29.8 per cent) the hospital refused to provide medical records; in 33 (27.3 per cent) there were transcription errors; in 20 (16.5 per cent) the state could not translate the identification number, primarily because the patients lost Medicaid eligibility too long before our request; in 27 (22.3 per cent) the hospital could not locate the patient's record; and in 5 (4.1 per cent) there were other reasons. Of those with a medical record, 121 (94.5 per cent) had a skin diagnosis and 109 (85.2 per cent) had a diagnosis compatible with {ICD}-9-{CM} code 695.1 specified on their discharge summary. However, in 35 (27.3 per cent) an expert reviewer felt that the discharge diagnosis was incorrect. In 50 (39 per cent) the computer diagnosis was incorrect. Only 19 (14.8 per cent) were judged by the expert reviewer to truly have Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and an additional 37 (28.9 per cent) were judged to have erythema multiforme minor. Thus, the computerized diagnosis agreed very well with the diagnoses specified on the discharge summary. However, {EM} is frequently misdiagnosed, {ICD}-9-{CM} code 695.1 contains multiple other diagnoses which are not {EM}, and much of hospitalized {EM} is {EM} minor.

Hypertension control was defined as systolic {BP} values of less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic {BP} values of less than 90 mm Hg. All survey periods were age-adjusted to the year 2000 {US} population. {RESULTS}: Rates of hypertension increased from 23.9\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 22.7\%-25.2\%) in 1988-1994 to 28.5\% (95\% {CI}, 25.9\%-31.3\%; P {\textless} .001) in 1999-2000, but did not change between 1999-2000 and 2007-2008 (29.0\%; 95\% {CI}, 27.6\%-30.5\%; P = .24).

We found that {aTRH} increased from 15.9\% (1998-2004) to 28.0\% (2005-2008) of treated patients (P{\textless}0.001). Clinical characteristics associated with {aTRH} included ≥4 visits per year, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and Framingham 10-year coronary risk {\textgreater}20\% (P{\textless}0.01).{\textbar}Untreated, undertreated, and {aTRH} patients have consistent characteristics that could inform strategies to improve blood pressure control by decreasing untreated hypertension, reducing therapeutic inertia in undertreated patients, and enhancing therapeutic efficiency in {aTRH}.},

	abstract = {Importance: {COVID}-19 altered lifestyles and disrupted routine health care. Whether blood pressure ({BP}) control worsened during {COVID}-19 is unknown. Objective: To understand whether home {BP} control worsened during {COVID}-19 across the United States ({US}). Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based analysis of home {BP} data from 72,706 participants enrolled in a digital health hypertension control program. Data was compared before (January 2019 to March 2020) and during (April 2020 to August 2020) {COVID}-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Monthly mean home {BP} readings, systolic blood pressure ({SBP}), diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}), and mean arterial pressure ({MAP}) were quantified before and during the pandemic. Multivariable adjustments were made for age, sex, race, region, and months enrolled. Home {BP} readings were also classified based on monthly averages and highest home {BP} readings into risk groups: Stage 2 {HTN}: {BP}{\textgreater} = 135 or {DBP}{\textgreater} = 85; Uncontrolled {HTN}: {SBP}{\textgreater} = 145 or {DBP}{\textgreater} = 95; or Severely uncontrolled {HTN}: {SBP}{\textgreater} = 160 or {DBP}{\textgreater} = 100). Results: Overall, 72,706 participants were enrolled in a digital health hypertension program between 1/1/2019 and 8/31/2020. Compared with participants pre-{COVID}-19 (n = 33,440), those during {COVID}-19 (n = 39,266) were of similar age (mean 53.0 ± 10.7 years vs 53.3 ± 10.8 years); sex (46\% vs 50.6\% female) and race (29.1\% vs 34.2\% non-white). Relative to pre-Covid (Apr-Aug 2019) the mean monthly number of home {BP} readings rose during {COVID}-19 (Apr-Aug, 2020), from 7.3 to 9.3 per month (P {\textless} .001). During {COVID}-19, participants had higher monthly adjusted mean {SBP} (131.6 {mmHg} vs. 127.5 {mmHg}, P {\textless} .001); {DBP} (80.2 {mmHg} vs. 79.2 {mmHg}, P {\textless} .001); and {MAP} (97.4 {mmHg} vs. 95.3 {mmHg}; P {\textless} .001). Relative to the pre-pandemic period, during {COVID}-19 the proportion of participants with a mean monthly {BP} classified as uncontrolled or severely uncontrolled hypertension also rose, 15\% vs 19\% and 4\% vs 5\%, respectively Conclusions and Relevance: Based on home {BP} readings, mean monthly {BP} rose modestly after {COVID}-19, despite increased utilization of home monitoring. Further studies are needed to examine the longitudinal effects of the pandemic on cardiovascular disease risk factors, the impact of these on long-term population health.},

Although a high prevalence of {aTRH} has been reported, few data are available on its association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes. We analyzed data on 14 684 Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial ({ALLHAT}) participants to determine the association between {aTRH} (n=1870) with coronary heart disease, stroke, all-cause mortality, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, and end-stage renal disease. We defined {aTRH} as blood pressure not at goal (systolic/diastolic blood pressure {\textgreater}/=140/90 mm Hg) while taking {\textgreater}/=3 classes of antihypertensive medication or taking {\textgreater}/=4 classes of antihypertensive medication with blood pressure at goal during the year 2 {ALLHAT} study visit (1996-2000). Use of a diuretic was not required to meet the definition of {aTRH}. Follow-up occurred through 2002. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95\% confidence intervals) comparing participants with versus without {aTRH} were as follows: coronary heart disease (1.44 [1.18-1.76]), stroke (1.57 [1.18-2.08]), all-cause mortality (1.30 [1.11-1.52]), heart failure (1.88 [1.52-2.34]), peripheral artery disease (1.23 [0.85-1.79]), and end-stage renal disease (1.95 [1.11-3.41]). {aTRH} was also associated with the pooled outcomes of combined coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.47; 95\% confidence interval, 1.26-1.71) and combined cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95\% confidence interval, 1.29-1.64). These results demonstrate that {aTRH} increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal disease. Studies are needed to identify approaches to prevent {aTRH} and reduce risk for adverse outcomes among individuals with {aTRH}.},

At a Year 2 follow-up visit, those with average blood pressure {\textgreater}/=140 mm Hg systolic or {\textgreater}/=90 mm Hg diastolic on {\textgreater}/=3 antihypertensive medications, or blood pressure {\textless}140/90 mm Hg on {\textgreater}/=4 antihypertensive medications were identified as having apparent treatment-resistant hypertension. The prevalence of treatment-resistant hypertension and its association with {ALLHAT} primary (combined fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction) and secondary (all-cause mortality, stroke, heart failure, combined coronary heart disease, and combined cardiovascular disease) outcomes were identified for each treatment group. {RESULTS}: Of participants assigned to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril, 9.6\%, 11.4\%, and 19.7\%, respectively, had treatment-resistant hypertension. During mean follow-up of 2.9 years, primary outcome incidence was similar for those assigned to chlorthalidone compared with amlodipine or lisinopril (amlodipine- vs chlorthalidone-adjusted hazard ratio [{HR}] 0.86; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.53-1.39; P = .53; lisinopril- vs chlorthalidone-adjusted {HR} = 1.06; 95\% {CI}, 0.70-1.60; P = .78). Secondary outcome risks were similar for most comparisons except coronary revascularization, which was higher with amlodipine than with chlorthalidone ({HR} 1.86; 95\% {CI}, 1.11-3.11; P = .02). An as-treated analysis based on diuretic use produced similar results. {CONCLUSIONS}: In this study, which titrated medications to a goal, participants assigned to chlorthalidone were less likely to develop treatment-resistant hypertension. However, prognoses in those with treatment-resistant hypertension were similar across treatment groups.},

Queries produced {BP} control metrics for adults with well-documented hypertension and a recent encounter at the health system for a series of 1-year measurement periods for each quarter of available data from January 2017 to March 2020. Aggregate weighted results are presented overall and by race and ethnicity. The most recent measurement period includes data from 1 737 995 patients, and 11 956 509 patient-years were included in the trend analysis. Overall, 15\% were Black, 52\% women, and 28\% had diabetes. {BP} control ({\textless}140/90 mm Hg) was observed in 62\% (range, 44\%-74\%) but varied by race and ethnicity, with the lowest {BP} control among Black patients at 57\% (odds ratio, 0.79; 95\% {CI}, 0.66-0.94). A new class of antihypertensive medication (medication intensification) was prescribed in just 12\% (range, 0.6\%-25\%) of patient visits where {BP} was uncontrolled. However, when medication intensification occurred, there was a large decrease in systolic {BP} (≈15 mm Hg; range, 5-18 mm Hg). {CONCLUSIONS}: Major opportunities exist for improving {BP} control and reducing disparities, especially through consistent medication intensification when {BP} is uncontrolled. These data demonstrate substantial room for improvement and opportunities to close health equity gaps.},

	abstract = {Therapeutic inertia ({TI}), defined as the providers' failure to increase therapy when treatment goals are unmet, contributes to the high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension ({\textgreater} 140/90 mm Hg), but the quantitative impact is unknown. To address this gap, a retrospective cohort study was conducted on 7253 hypertensives that had {\textgreater}4 visits and {\textgreater}1 elevated blood pressure ({BP}) in 2003. A 1-year {TI} score was calculated for each patient as the difference between expected and observed medication change rates with higher scores reflecting greater {TI}. Antihypertensive therapy was increased on 13.1\% of visits with uncontrolled {BP}. Systolic {BP} decreased in patients in the lowest quintile of the {TI} score but increased in those in the highest quintile (-6.8±0.5 versus +1.8±0.6 mm Hg; P{\textless}0.001). Individuals in the lowest {TI} quintile were ≈33 times more likely to have their {BP} controlled at the last visit than those in highest quintile (odds ratio, 32.7; 95\% {CI}, 25.1 to 42.6; P{\textless}0.0001). By multivariable analysis, {TI} accounted for ≈19\% of the variance in {BP} control. If {TI} scores were decreased ≈50\%, that is, increasing medication dosages on ≈30\% of visits, {BP} control would increase from the observed 45.1\% to a projected 65.9\% in 1 year. This study confirms the high rate of {TI} in uncontrolled hypertensive subjects. {TI} has a major impact on {BP} control in hypertensive subjects receiving regular care. Reducing {TI} is critical in attaining the Healthy People 2010 goal of controlling hypertension in 50\% of all patients. © 2006 American Heart Association, Inc.},

Although during {COVID}-19 telemedicine has thrived, and its adoption has moved forward in many countries, important gaps still remain. Major issues to be addressed to enable large scale implementation of telemedicine include: (1) establishing adequate policies to legislate telemedicine, license healthcare operators, protect patients’ privacy, and implement reimbursement plans; (2) creating and disseminating practical guidelines for the routine clinical use of telemedicine in different contexts; (3) increasing in the level of integration of telemedicine with traditional healthcare services; (4) improving healthcare professionals’ and patients’ awareness of and willingness to use telemedicine; and (5) overcoming inequalities among countries and population subgroups due to technological, infrastructural, and economic barriers. If all these requirements are met in the near future, remote management of patients will become an indispensable resource for the healthcare systems worldwide and will ultimately improve the management of patients and the quality of care.},

Recent Findings: Telehealth interventions in various forms have proven to be efficacious in the management of obesity, hypertension, glycemic control in diabetes, hyperlipidemia, medication adherence, and {ICU} length of stay and mortality. The use and study of such interventions have been greatly expanded during the pandemic partly due to the expanded coverage by payers. However, heterogenous interventions and a relative lack of cost analyses are barriers to more widespread adoption. Summary: Telehealth has proven efficacy for modifying risk factors for cardiovascular disease. To date, this has not been shown to translate to a reduction in hard cardiovascular endpoints such as mortality. With ongoing research and expanded funding, the role of telehealth is likely to evolve as the {COVID} pandemic continues.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Patients with chronic disease often take many medications multiple times per day. Such regimen complexity is associated with medication nonadherence. Other factors, including the number of pharmacy visits patients make to pick up their prescriptions, may also undermine adherence. Our objective was to estimate the extent of prescribing and filling complexity in patients prescribed a cardiovascular medication and to evaluate its association with adherence. {METHODS}: The study population comprised individuals prescribed a statin (n = 1 827 395) or an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor or renin angiotensin receptor blocker ({ACEI}/{ARB}) (n = 1 480 304) between June 1, 2006, and May 30, 2007. We estimated complexity by measuring the number of medications, prescribers, pharmacies, pharmacy visits, and refill consolidation (a measure of the number of visits per fill) during the 3 months from the first prescription. The number of daily doses was also measured in {ACEI}/{ARB} users. After this period, adherence was evaluated over the subsequent year. The relationship between complexity and adherence was assessed with multivariable linear regression. {RESULTS}: The statin cohort had a mean age of 63 years and were 49\% male. On average, during the 3-month complexity assessment period, statin users filled 11.4 prescriptions for 6.3 different medications, had prescriptions written by 2 prescribers, and made 5.0 visits to the pharmacy. Results for {ACEI}/{ARB} users were similar. Greater prescribing and filling complexity was associated with lower levels of adherence. In adjusted models, patients with the least refill consolidation had adherence rates that were 8\% lower over the subsequent year than patients with the greatest refill consolidation. {CONCLUSION}: Medication use and prescription filling for patients with cardiovascular disease is complex, and strategies to reduce this complexity may help improve medication adherence.},

	abstract = {Background: Telemedicine visit use vastly expanded during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, and this has had an uncertain impact on cardiovascular care quality.
Objective: We sought to examine the association between telemedicine visits and the failure to meet the Controlling High Blood Pressure ({BP}) quality measure from the Centers for Medicare \&amp; Medicaid Services.
Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of 32,727 adult patients with hypertension who were seen in primary care and cardiology clinics at an urban, academic medical center from February to December 2020. The primary outcome was a failure to meet the Controlling High Blood Pressure quality measure, which was defined as having no {BP} recorded or having a last recorded {BP} of ≥140/90 mm Hg (ie, poor {BP} control). Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between telemedicine visit use during the study period (none, 1 telemedicine visit, or ≥2 telemedicine visits) and poor {BP} control; we adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics.
Results: During the study period, no {BP} was recorded for 2.3\% (486/20,745) of patients with in-person visits only, 27.1\% (1863/6878) of patients with 1 telemedicine visit, and 25\% (1277/5104) of patients with ≥2 telemedicine visits. After adjustment, telemedicine use was associated with poor {BP} control (1 telemedicine visit: odds ratio [{OR}] 2.06, 95\% {CI} 1.94-2.18; P\&lt;.001; ≥2 telemedicine visits: {OR} 2.49, 95\% {CI} 2.31-2.68; P\&lt;.001; reference: in-person visits only). This effect disappeared when the analysis was restricted to patients with at least 1 recorded {BP} (1 telemedicine visit: {OR} 0.89, 95\% {CI} 0.83-0.95; P=.001; ≥2 telemedicine visits: {OR} 0.91, 95\% {CI} 0.83-0.99; P=.03).
Conclusions: Increased telemedicine visit use is associated with poorer performance on the Controlling High Blood Pressure quality measure. However, telemedicine visit use may not negatively impact {BP} control when {BP} is recorded.},

	abstract = {Over the past 20 years it has become recognized that low-grade inflammation plays a role in cardiovascular disease. More recently, participation of the innate and the adaptive immune response in mechanisms that contribute to inflammation in cardiovascular disease has been reported in atherosclerosis and hypertension. Different subsets of lymphocytes and their cytokines are involved in vascular remodelling and hypertensive renal disease as well as heart disease. Effector T cells including T-helper (Th) 1 (interferon-γ-producing) and Th2 lymphocytes (interleukin-4 producing), as well as Th17 (which produce interleukin-17), and T suppressor lymphocytes such as T regulatory cells, which express the transcription factor forkhead box P3, participate respectively as pro- and anti-inflammatory cells, and mediate effects of angiotensin {II} and mineralocorticoids. Involvement of immune mechanisms in cardiac, vascular, and renal changes in hypertension has been demonstrated in many experimental models, an example being the Dahl-salt sensitive rat and the spontaneously hypertensive rat. How activation of immunity is triggered remains unknown, but neoantigens could be generated by elevated blood pressure through damage-associated molecular pattern receptors or other mechanisms. When activated, Th1 may contribute to blood pressure elevation by affecting the kidney, vascular remodelling of blood vessels directly via effects of the cytokines produced, or through their effects on perivascular fat. T regulatory cells protect from blood pressure elevation acting on similar targets. These novel findings may open the way for new therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes in hypertension and cardiovascular disease in humans. © 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Suspected diabetogenic effects or drug indication may increase testing for diabetes mellitus ({DM}), resulting in measurement bias when evaluating diabetogenic drug effects. We sought to evaluate the validity of electronic health record data in determining {DM} risk. {METHODS}: We used time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models within a retrospective cohort design to assess associations between use of antihypertensives, statins, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants, and two endpoints: (i) {DM} onset defined as fasting blood glucose ({BG}) {\textgreater}/=126 mg/dl, random {BG} {\textgreater}/=200 mg/dl, {HbA}1c {\textgreater}/=7.0\%, or antidiabetic drug initiation; and (ii) first negative {DM} test. We used Poisson regression to assess the influence of these drugs on {DM} testing rates. Patients aged 35-64 years enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northwest between 1997 and 2010 entered the cohort at the first negative {BG} test after {\textgreater}/=6 months without manifest {DM}. {RESULTS}: All drug classes showed significant associations not only with {DM} onset but also with first negative {BG} test and with {DM} testing rates. Antipsychotics had the greatest diabetogenic risk (adjusted hazard ratio [{HR}] = 1.73 [1.44-2.08]), the greatest propensity for a first negative test (adjusted {HR} = 1.87 [1.74-2.01]), and the highest testing rate (adjusted rate ratio = 1.76 [1.72-1.81]. Although renin-angiotensin system blockers and calcium channel blockers have shown no diabetogenic risk in clinical trials, both were associated with {DM} ({HR} = 1.19 [1.12-1.26] and 1.27 [1.17-1.38]), a negative glucose test (1.38 [1.35-1.41] and 1.24 [1.20-1.28]), and increased testing rates (rate ratio = 1.26 [1.24-1.27] and 1.27 [1.25-1.28]). {CONCLUSION}: Caution should be used when diabetogenic risk is evaluated using data that rely on {DM} testing in general practice.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundHypertension} is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and accounts for approximately 9.4 million deaths globally every year. Hypertension is a complex entity, which is influenced by genetic and environmental factors, such as physical inactivity, obesity, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, stress, diet and why not the microbiome.{MethodsWe} searched {PubMed} using the words 'microbiome', 'microbiota' and 'hypertension' until December 2018. We found information regarding the role of the brain-gut-bone marrow axis, the brain-gut-kidney axis, the high-salt diet, short-chain fatty acids ({SCFAs}), neurotransitters, such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, nitric oxide, endothelin and steroids in modulating gut microbiota and in contributing to the pathogenesis of hypertension. The brain-gut-bone marrow axis refers to the hypothesis that hematopoietic stem cells might migrate to the brain or to the gut, and thus, contribute to local inflammation and several immune responses. This migration may further enhance the sympathetic activity and contribute to blood pressure elevation. On the other hand, {SCFAs}, such as acetate and butyrate, have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects on myeloid and intestinal epithelial cells. Also, researchers have noted diminution in microbial richness and diversity in hypertensive patients as well as marked differences in circulating inflammatory cells in hypertensive patients, when compared with controls. In addition, activation of renal sympathetic nerve activity might directly influence renal physiology, by altering body fluid balance and plasma metabolite secretion and retention. These events culminate in the development of chronic kidney disease and hypertension.{ConclusionThere} is a long way ahead regarding the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis and as an adjunctive treatment of hypertension. Treatment of dysbiosis could be a useful therapeutic approach to add to traditional antihypertensive therapy. Manipulating gut microbiota using prebiotics and probiotics might prove a valuable tool to traditional antihypertensives.},

The median (range) disease-specific {MRCI} was significantly greater for diabetes (8.0 [3-21]) than for hypertension (3.0 [2-11], P {\textless} 0.001), though the median number of disease-specific medications was identical (2). The majority of hypertension {MRC} was the result of dosage frequency (62.1\%), while diabetes {MRC} was distributed among dosage form (38.3\%), frequency (39.1\%), and additional directions (27.6\%). The median patient-level {MRCI} scores for each group were 11 to 15 points higher than the disease-specific {MRCI} scores. Higher {MRCI} scores were associated with higher regimen cost, comorbidity burden, and female gender. {CONCLUSION}: The magnitude of {MRCI} scores varied across the three disease groups, increased dramatically when all medications were considered, and revealed greater complexity than a simple count of prescribed medications. The {MRCI} may be a useful tool for targeting patients for whom medication therapy management services would be most beneficial and cost effective.},

	abstract = {Anticipating a growing need for health care during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services expanded telemedicine coverage in the United States on March 6, 2020. In this study we used roughly thirty million Medicare fee-for-service claims to quantify outpatient telemedicine use before and after the Medicare telemedicine coverage waiver and to examine the association of telemedicine use with the Area Deprivation Index, a comprehensive measure of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage. Before the waiver, 0.42 percent of patients had at least one outpatient telemedicine visit, with no significant differences between people residing in the most versus the least disadvantaged neighborhoods. With the waiver, 9.97 percent of patients had at least one outpatient telemedicine visit, with the highest odds of utilization seen for people residing in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods. After adjustment, our data suggest that the coverage waiver increased access to telemedicine for all Medicare populations, including people residing in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods, although the odds of use were persistently lower with increasing age. Overall, these findings are encouraging, but they illuminate a need for targeted interventions to improve telemedicine access further.},

Of these patients 161 were randomized to receive bisoprolol and 169 to receive nifedipine slow release. There were two treatment phases of 4 weeks each, with 48-h Holter monitoring after each phase. During phase 1, patients received either 10 mg of bisoprolol daily or 2 x 20 mg of nifedipine slow release. During phase 2, they received either 20 mg of bisoprolol daily or 2 x 40 mg of nifedipine slow release. {RESULTS}: In phase 1 of the trial, 4 weeks of bisoprolol therapy (10 mg daily) reduced the mean [+/- {SD}] number of transient ischemic episodes from 8.1 +/- 0.6 to 3.2 +/- 0.4/48 h. Nifedipine (2 x 20 mg) reduced transient ischemic episodes from 8.3 +/- 0.5 to 5.9 +/- 0.4/48 h. Total duration of ischemia was reduced from 99.3 +/- 10.1 to 31.9 +/- 5.5 min/48 h with bisoprolol and from 101 +/- 9.1 to 72.6 +/- 8.1 min/48 h with nifedipine. Reductions were statistically significant for both drugs; the difference between bisoprolol and nifedipine was also significant (p {\textless} 0.0001). Bisoprolol reduced the heart rate at onset of episodes by 13.7 +/- 1.4 beats/min from a baseline value of 99.5 +/- 1.2 beats/min (p {\textless} 0.001). Heart rate was unchanged with nifedipine. Bisoprolol had significantly higher responder rates than nifedipine. Doubling of the dose in phase 2 of the trial had small additive effects. Only bisoprolol showed a marked circadian effect by reducing the morning peak of transient ischemic episodes (by 68\% at peak time, 8:00 to 8:59 {AM}). {CONCLUSIONS}: Both bisoprolol and nifedipine reduced the number and duration of transient ischemic episodes in patients with chronic stable angina. Bisoprolol was significantly more effective than nifedipine in both doses tested and reduced the morning peak of ischemic activity.},

These community-based cohorts included white and African American men and women with blood pressure assessment at multiple cohort examinations.Cumulative lifetime risk for hypertension from ages 20 through 85 years, adjusted for competing risk of death and baseline hypertension prevalence. Incident hypertension under the {AHA}/{ACC} threshold was defined by a single-occasion blood pressure measurement of 130/80 mm Hg or more or self-reported use of antihypertensive medications. Incident hypertension under the {JNC}7 threshold was defined by a single-occasion blood pressure measurement of 140/90 mm Hg or more or the use of antihypertensive medications.A total of 13 160 participants contributed 227 600 person-years of follow-up; the data set included individual-level data on 6313 participants at baseline (median age, 25 years), plus person-year data from participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities and Framingham Offspring studies who enrolled at older ages. Baseline prevalence of hypertension under the {AHA}/{ACC} 2017 threshold in participants entering the data set between 20 and 30 years of age was 30.7\% in white men (n = 549 of 1790), 23.1\% in African American men (n = 245 of 1063), 10.2\% in white women (n = 210 of 2070), and 12.3\% in African American women (n = 171 of 1390). White men had lifetime risk of hypertension of 83.8\% (95\% {CI}, 82.5\%-85.0\%); African American men, 86.1\% (95\% {CI}, 84.1\%-88.1\%); white women, 69.3\% (95\% {CI}, 67.8\%-70.7\%); and African American women, 85.7\% (95\% {CI}, 84.0\%-87.5\%). These were greater than corresponding lifetime risks under the {JNC}7 threshold for hypertension (white men, 60.5\% [95\% {CI}, 58.9\%-62.1\%]; African American men, 74.7\% [95\% {CI}, 71.9\%-77.5\%]; white women, 53.9\% [95\% {CI}, 52.5\%-55.4\%]; and African American women, 77.3\% [95\% {CI}, 75.0\%-79.5\%]).Under the {AHA}/{ACC} 2017 blood pressure threshold for hypertension, lifetime risks for hypertension exceeded 75\% for African American men and women and white men. Furthermore, prevalence of blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or more is very high in young adulthood, suggesting that efforts to prevent development of hypertension should be focused early in the life course.},

We train L1 penalized logistic regression models for a chronic and an acute disease and evaluate the performance of the models against a gold standard. {RESULTS}: Our models for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction achieve precision and accuracy of 0.90, 0.89, and 0.86, 0.89, respectively. Local implementations of the previously validated rule-based definitions for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction achieve precision and accuracy of 0.96, 0.92 and 0.84, 0.87, respectively.We have demonstrated feasibility of learning phenotype models using imperfectly labeled data for a chronic and acute phenotype. Further research in feature engineering and in specification of the keyword list can improve the performance of the models and the scalability of the approach. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our method provides an alternative to manual labeling for creating training sets for statistical models of phenotypes. Such an approach can accelerate research with large observational healthcare datasets and may also be used to create local phenotype models.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many systematic reviews exist on interventions to improve safe and effective medicines use by consumers, but research is distributed across diseases, populations and settings. The scope and focus of such reviews also vary widely, creating challenges for decision-makers seeking to inform decisions by using the evidence on consumers' medicines use.This is an update of a 2011 overview of systematic reviews, which synthesises the evidence, irrespective of disease, medicine type, population or setting, on the effectiveness of interventions to improve consumers' medicines use. {OBJECTIVES}: To assess the effects of interventions which target healthcare consumers to promote safe and effective medicines use, by synthesising review-level evidence. {METHODS}: {SEARCH} {METHODS}: We included systematic reviews published on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. We identified relevant reviews by handsearching databases from their start dates to March 2012. {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: We screened and ranked reviews based on relevance to consumers' medicines use, using criteria developed for this overview. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: We used standardised forms to extract data, and assessed reviews for methodological quality using the {AMSTAR} tool. We used standardised language to summarise results within and across reviews; and gave bottom-line statements about intervention effectiveness. Two review authors screened and selected reviews, and extracted and analysed data. We used a taxonomy of interventions to categorise reviews and guide syntheses. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: We included 75 systematic reviews of varied methodological quality. Reviews assessed interventions with diverse aims including support for behaviour change, risk minimisation and skills acquisition. No reviews aimed to promote systems-level consumer participation in medicines-related activities. Medicines adherence was the most frequently-reported outcome, but others such as knowledge, clinical and service-use outcomes were also reported. Adverse events were less commonly identified, while those associated with the interventions themselves, or costs, were rarely reported.Looking across reviews, for most outcomes, medicines self-monitoring and self-management programmes appear generally effective to improve medicines use, adherence, adverse events and clinical outcomes; and to reduce mortality in people self-managing antithrombotic therapy. However, some participants were unable to complete these interventions, suggesting they may not be suitable for everyone.Other promising interventions to improve adherence and other key medicines-use outcomes, which require further investigation to be more certain of their effects, include:. simplified dosing regimens: with positive effects on adherence;. interventions involving pharmacists in medicines management, such as medicines reviews (with positive effects on adherence and use, medicines problems and clinical outcomes) and pharmaceutical care services (consultation between pharmacist and patient to resolve medicines problems, develop a care plan and provide follow-up; with positive effects on adherence and knowledge).Several other strategies showed some positive effects, particularly relating to adherence, and other outcomes, but their effects were less consistent overall and so need further study. These included:. delayed antibiotic prescriptions: effective to decrease antibiotic use but with mixed effects on clinical outcomes, adverse effects and satisfaction;. practical strategies like reminders, cues and/or organisers, reminder packaging and material incentives: with positive, although somewhat mixed effects on adherence;. education delivered with self-management skills training, counselling, support, training or enhanced follow-up; information and counselling delivered together; or education/information as part of pharmacist-delivered packages of care: with positive effects on adherence, medicines use, clinical outcomes and knowledge, but with mixed effects in some studies;. financial incentives: with positive, but mixed, effects on adherence.Several strategies also showed promise in promoting immunisation uptake, but require further study to be more certain of their effects. These included organisational interventions; reminders and recall; financial incentives; home visits; free vaccination; lay health worker interventions; and facilitators working with physicians to promote immunisation uptake. Education and/or information strategies also showed some positive but even less consistent effects on immunisation uptake, and need further assessment of effectiveness and investigation of heterogeneity.There are many different potential pathways through which consumers' use of medicines could be targeted to improve outcomes, and simple interventions may be as effective as complex strategies. However, no single intervention assessed was effective to improve all medicines-use outcomes across all diseases, medicines, populations or settings.Even where interventions showed promise, the assembled evidence often only provided part of the picture: for example, simplified dosing regimens seem effective for improving adherence, but there is not yet sufficient information to identify an optimal regimen.In some instances interventions appear ineffective: for example, the evidence suggests that directly observed therapy may be generally ineffective for improving treatment completion, adherence or clinical outcomes.In other cases, interventions may have variable effects across outcomes. As an example, strategies providing information or education as single interventions appear ineffective to improve medicines adherence or clinical outcomes, but may be effective to improve knowledge; an important outcome for promoting consumers' informed medicines choices.Despite a doubling in the number of reviews included in this updated overview, uncertainty still exists about the effectiveness of many interventions, and the evidence on what works remains sparse for several populations, including children and young people, carers, and people with multimorbidity. {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: This overview presents evidence from 75 reviews that have synthesised trials and other studies evaluating the effects of interventions to improve consumers' medicines use.Systematically assembling the evidence across reviews allows identification of effective or promising interventions to improve consumers' medicines use, as well as those for which the evidence indicates ineffectiveness or uncertainty.Decision makers faced with implementing interventions to improve consumers' medicines use can use this overview to inform decisions about which interventions may be most promising to improve particular outcomes. The intervention taxonomy may also assist people to consider the strategies available in relation to specific purposes, for example, gaining skills or being involved in decision making. Researchers and funders can use this overview to identify where more research is needed and assess its priority. The limitations of the available literature due to the lack of evidence for important outcomes and important populations, such as people with multimorbidity, should also be considered in practice and policy decisions.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: People who are prescribed self administered medications typically take only about half their prescribed doses. Efforts to assist patients with adherence to medications might improve the benefits of prescribed medications. {OBJECTIVES}: The primary objective of this review is to assess the effects of interventions intended to enhance patient adherence to prescribed medications for medical conditions, on both medication adherence and clinical outcomes. {SEARCH} {METHODS}: We updated searches of The Cochrane Library, including {CENTRAL} (via http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cochranelibrary/search/), {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, {PsycINFO} (all via Ovid), {CINAHL} (via {EBSCO}), and Sociological Abstracts (via {ProQuest}) on 11 January 2013 with no language restriction. We also reviewed bibliographies in articles on patient adherence, and contacted authors of relevant original and review articles. {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: We included unconfounded {RCTs} of interventions to improve adherence with prescribed medications, measuring both medication adherence and clinical outcome, with at least 80\% follow-up of each group studied and, for long-term treatments, at least six months follow-up for studies with positive findings at earlier time points. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two review authors independently extracted all data and a third author resolved disagreements. The studies differed widely according to medical condition, patient population, intervention, measures of adherence, and clinical outcomes. Pooling results according to one of these characteristics still leaves highly heterogeneous groups, and we could not justify meta-analysis. Instead, we conducted a qualitative analysis with a focus on the {RCTs} with the lowest risk of bias for study design and the primary clinical outcome. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: The present update included 109 new {RCTs} published since the previous update in January 2007, bringing the total number of {RCTs} to 182; we found five {RCTs} from the previous update to be ineligible and excluded them. Studies were heterogeneous for patients, medical problems, treatment regimens, adherence interventions, and adherence and clinical outcome measurements, and most had high risk of bias. The main changes in comparison with the previous update include that we now: 1) report a lack of convincing evidence also specifically among the studies with the lowest risk of bias; 2) do not try to classify studies according to intervention type any more, due to the large heterogeneity; 3) make our database available for collaboration on sub-analyses, in acknowledgement of the need to make collective advancement in this difficult field of research. Of all 182 {RCTs}, 17 had the lowest risk of bias for study design features and their primary clinical outcome, 11 from the present update and six from the previous update. The {RCTs} at lowest risk of bias generally involved complex interventions with multiple components, trying to overcome barriers to adherence by means of tailored ongoing support from allied health professionals such as pharmacists, who often delivered intense education, counseling (including motivational interviewing or cognitive behavioral therapy by professionals) or daily treatment support (or both), and sometimes additional support from family or peers. Only five of these {RCTs} reported improvements in both adherence and clinical outcomes, and no common intervention characteristics were apparent. Even the most effective interventions did not lead to large improvements in adherence or clinical outcomes. {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Across the body of evidence, effects were inconsistent from study to study, and only a minority of lowest risk of bias {RCTs} improved both adherence and clinical outcomes. Current methods of improving medication adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective, so that the full benefits of treatment cannot be realized. The research in this field needs advances, including improved design of feasible long-term interventions, objective adherence measures, and sufficient study power to detect improvements in patient-important clinical outcomes. By making our comprehensive database available for sharing we hope to contribute to achieving these advances.},

	abstract = {Background: Telemedicine can be used to manage various health conditions, but there is a need to investigate its effectiveness for chronic disease management in the primary care setting. This study compares the effect of synchronous telemedicine versus in-person primary care visits on patient clinical outcomes. Methods: A systematic review of studies published in {PubMed} and Web of Science between 1996 and January 2021 was performed using keywords related to telemedicine, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Included studies compared synchronous telemedicine versus in-person visits with a primary care clinician, and examined outcomes of hemoglobin A1c ({HbA}1c), blood pressure, and/or lipid levels. Results: Of 1724 citations screened, 7 publications met our inclusion criteria. Included studies were published between 2000 and 2018. Three studies were conducted in the United States, 2 in Spain, 1 in Sweden, and 1 in the United Kingdom. The telemedicine interventions investigated were multifaceted. All included synchronous visits with a primary care provider through videoconferencing and/or telephone, combined with other components such as asynchronous patient data transmission. Five studies reported on {HbA}1c changes, 5 on blood pressure changes, and 3 on changes in lipid levels. Compared to usual care with in-person visits, telemedicine was associated with greater reductions in {HbA}1c at 6 months and similar {HbA}1c outcomes at 12 months. Telemedicine conferred no significant differences in blood pressure and lipid levels compared to in-person clinic visits. Conclusions: A systematic review of the literature found few studies comparing clinical outcomes resulting from synchronous telemedicine versus in-person office visits, but the existing literature showed that in the primary care setting, telemedicine was not inferior to in-person visits for the management of diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia. These results hold promise for continued use of telemedicine for chronic disease management.},

	abstract = {For {\textgreater}50 years, it has been recognized that immunity contributes to hypertension. Recent data have defined an important role of T cells and various T cell-derived cytokines in several models of experimental hypertension. These studies have shown that stimuli like angiotensin {II}, deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt, and excessive catecholamines lead to formation of effector like T cells that infiltrate the kidney and perivascular regions of both large arteries and arterioles. There is also accumulation of monocyte/macrophages in these regions. Cytokines released from these cells, including interleukin-17, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factoralpha, and interleukin-6 promote both renal and vascular dysfunction and damage, leading to enhanced sodium retention and increased systemic vascular resistance. The renal effects of these cytokines remain to be fully defined, but include enhanced formation of angiotensinogen, increased sodium reabsorption, and increased renal fibrosis. Recent experiments have defined a link between oxidative stress and immune activation in hypertension. These have shown that hypertension is associated with formation of reactive oxygen species in dendritic cells that lead to formation of gamma ketoaldehydes, or isoketals. These rapidly adduct to protein lysines and are presented by dendritic cells as neoantigens that activate T cells and promote hypertension. Thus, cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system contribute to end-organ damage and dysfunction in hypertension. Therapeutic interventions to reduce activation of these cells may prove beneficial in reducing end-organ damage and preventing consequences of hypertension, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, renal failure, and stroke.},

Incidence, prevalence, and predictors of {TRH} were compared using the updated definition (requiring {\textgreater}/=4 drugs to achieve {BP} {\textless} 130/80 mm Hg) during intensive treatment, vs the former definition (requiring {\textgreater}/=4 drugs to achieve {BP} {\textless} 140/90 mm Hg) during standard treatment. Incidence/prevalence of apparent refractory hypertension ({RFH}; uncontrolled {BP} despite {\textgreater}/=5 drugs) was similarly compared. Overall, 5702 and 6082 patients were included in the intensive and standard treatment cohorts, respectively. Crude {TRH} incidence using the updated definition under intensive treatment was 30.3 (95\% {CI}, 29.3-31.4) per 100 patient-years, compared with 9.7 (95\% {CI}, 9.2-10.2) using the prior definition under standard treatment. Point prevalence using the prior {TRH} definition at 1-year was 7.5\% in {SPRINT} and 14\% in {ACCORD} vs 22\% and 36\%, respectively, with the updated {TRH} definition. Significant predictors of incident {TRH} included number of baseline antihypertensive drugs, having diabetes, baseline systolic {BP}, and Black race. Incidence of apparent {RFH} was also significantly greater using the updated vs prior definition (4.5 vs 1.0 per 100 person-years). Implementation of the 2017 hypertension guideline, including lower {BP} goals for most individuals, is expected to substantially increase treatment burden and incident {TRH} among the hypertensive population.},

Among 205 750 patients with incident hypertension, 1.9\% developed resistant hypertension within a median of 1.5 years from initial treatment (0.7 cases per 100 person-years of follow-up). These patients were more often men, were older, and had higher rates of diabetes mellitus than nonresistant patients.

Multivariable random effects regression was used to estimate the probability of antihypertensive intensification at 12 months for usual care versus {SMBP}. Using these data, we simulated 5-year {BP} control rates using a validated mathematical model. Trial participants were mostly older adults (mean age 66.6 years, {SD} 9.5), male (53.9\%), and predominantly white (95.6\%); mean baseline {BP} was 151.8/85.0 mm Hg. Compared with usual care, the likelihood of antihypertensive intensification increased with both {SMBP} with feedback to patient or provider alone (odds ratio 1.8, 95\% {CI} 1.2–2.6) and with telemonitoring or self-management (3.3, 2.5–4.2). Over 5 years, we estimated 33.4\% {BP} control ({\textless}140/90 mm Hg) with usual care (95\% uncertainty interval 27.7\%–39.4\%). One year of {SMBP} with feedback to patient or provider alone achieved 33.9\% (28.3\%–40.3\%) {BP} control and {SMBP} with telemonitoring or self-management 39.0\% (33.1\%–45.2\%) over 5 years. If {SMBP} interventions and associated {BP} control processes were extended to 5 years, {BP} control increased to 52.4\% (45.4\%–59.8 \%) and 72.1\% (66.5\%–77.6\%), respectively. {CONCLUSIONS}: One year of {SMBP} plus telemonitoring or self-management increases the likelihood of antihypertensive intensification and could improve {BP} control rates at 5 years; continuing {SMBP} for 5 years could further improve {BP} control.},

Mean diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}) was similar in the three countries before age 50 and then fell more rapidly in the {USA}, being the lowest in the {USA}. Only 34\% had a {BP} under 140/90 mm Hg in England, compared with 50\% in the {USA} and 66\% in Canada. Prehypertension and stages 1 and 2 hypertension prevalence figures were the highest in England. Hypertension prevalence ({\textgreater}/=140 mm Hg {SBP} and/or {\textgreater}/=90 mm Hg {DBP}) was lower in Canada (19.5\%) than in the {USA} (29\%) and England (30\%). Hypertension awareness was higher in the {USA} (81\%) and Canada (83\%) than in England (65\%). England also had lower levels of hypertension treatment (51\%; {USA} 74\%; Canada 80\%) and control ({\textless}140/90 mm Hg; 27\%; the {USA} 53\%; Canada 66\%). Canada had the lowest stroke and {IHD} mortality rates, England the highest and the rates were inversely related to the mean {SBP} in each country and strongly related to the blood pressure indicators, the strongest relationship being between low hypertension awareness and stroke mortality. {CONCLUSIONS}: While the current prevention efforts in England should result in future-improved figures, especially at younger ages, these data still show important gaps in the management of hypertension in these countries, with consequences on stroke and {IHD} mortality.},

	abstract = {Introduction Hypertension is highly prevalent in Florida, but surveillance through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ({BRFSS}) is limited to self-reported hypertension and does not capture data on undiagnosed hypertension or measure blood pressure. We aimed to characterize the hypertensive population in the {OneFlorida} Clinical Research Consortium by using electronic health records and provide proof-of-concept for using routinely collected clinical data to augment surveillance efforts. Methods We identified patients with hypertension, defined as having at least 1 outpatient visit from January 2012 through June 2016 with an {ICD}-9-{CM} or {ICD}-10-{CM} diagnosis code for hypertension, or in the absence of a diagnosis, an elevated blood pressure (systolic =140 mm Hg or diastolic =90 mm Hg) recorded in the electronic health record at the most recent visit. The hypertensive population was characterized and mapped by zip code of patient residence to county prevalence. Results Of 838,469 patients (27.9\% prevalence) who met the criteria for hypertension, 68\% had received a diagnosis and 61\% had elevated blood pressure. The geographic distribution of hypertension differed between diagnosed hypertension (highest prevalence in northern Florida) and undiagnosed hypertension (highest prevalence along eastern coast, in southern Florida, and in some rural western Panhandle counties). Uncontrolled hypertension was concentrated in southern Florida and the western Panhandle. Conclusion Our use of clinical data, representing usual care for Floridians, allows for identifying cases of uncontrolled hypertension and potentially undiagnosed cases, which are not captured by existing surveillance methods. Large-scale pragmatic research networks, like {OneFlorida}, may be increasingly important for tailoring future health care services, trials, and public health programs.},

Clinical practice guidelines for managing hypertension in the United States recommend a target blood pressure ({BP}) {\textless}130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes or {CKD}, notably lower than the 140/90-mm Hg threshold for the general hypertensive population. However, the optimal timeframe from initiation of antihypertensive therapy to attaining these levels of {BP} control and influencing cardiovascular outcomes is not as well defined. Overall, a series of landmark {BP} intervention trials in patients with hypertension and additional cardiovascular risk factors collectively support that achieving prompt {BP} control, ideally within 1-3 months, translates into improved cardiovascular outcomes. Although the consistency of the findings is encouraging, the strength of this conclusion is limited by the available data, which were derived from studies not designed to determine the definition or benefits of early {BP} reduction. In several of these studies, using a treatment approach with initial monotherapy or combination therapy has clearly demonstrated pronounced {BP} lowering and high {BP} control rates within an intensive timeframe of 3-6 months of therapy. Although these studies were not conducted exclusively in high-risk patients, subgroup analyses have demonstrated that the observed outcomes in the overall study populations apply to the diabetic and {CKD} subsets.},

Using electronic health record data from 10,000 patients who received anesthetic services at a major metropolitan tertiary care academic medical center, an affiliated hospital for women and children, and an affiliated urban primary care hospital, the correlation between patient health status and counts of days with laboratory results or medication orders, as indicated by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification ({ASA} Class), was assessed with a Negative Binomial Regression model. Higher {ASA} Class was associated with more points of data: compared to {ASA} Class 1 patients, {ASA} Class 4 patients had 5.05 times the number of days with laboratory results and 6.85 times the number of days with medication orders, controlling for age, sex, emergency status, admission type, primary diagnosis, and procedure. Imposing data sufficiency requirements for subject selection allows researchers to minimize missing data when reusing electronic health records for research, but introduces a bias towards the selection of sicker patients. We demonstrated the relationship between patient health and quantity of data, which may result in a systematic bias towards the selection of sicker patients for research studies and limit the external validity of research conducted using electronic health record data. Additionally, we discovered other variables (i.e., admission status, age, emergency classification, procedure, and diagnosis) that independently affect data sufficiency.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The purpose of this study was to identify potential health system solutions to suboptimal use of antihypertensive therapy in a diverse cohort of patients initiating treatment. {METHODS}: Using a hypertension registry at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 44 167 adults (age, {\textgreater}/=18 years) with hypertension who were new users of antihypertensive therapy in 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to model the relationships between race/ethnicity, specific health system factors, and early nonpersistence (failing to refill the first prescription within 90 days) and nonadherence ({\textless}80\% of days covered during the 12 months following the start of treatment), respectively, controlling for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors. {RESULTS}: More than 30\% of patients were early nonpersistent and 1 in 5 were nonadherent to therapy. Nonwhites were more likely to exhibit both types of suboptimal medication-taking behavior compared with whites. In logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical, and health system factors, nonwhite race was associated with early nonpersistence (black: odds ratio, 1.56 [95\% {CI}, 1.43-1.70]; Asian: 1.40 [1.29-1.51]; Hispanic: 1.46 [1.35-1.57]) and nonadherence (black: 1.55 [1.37-1.77]; Asian: 1.13 [1.00-1.28]; Hispanic: 1.46 [1.31-1.63]). The likelihood of early nonpersistence varied between Asians and Hispanics by choice of first-line therapy. In addition, racial and ethnic differences in nonadherence were appreciably attenuated when medication co-payment and mail-order pharmacy use were accounted for in the models. {CONCLUSIONS}: Racial/ethnic differences in medication-taking behavior occur early in the course of treatment. However, health system strategies designed to reduce patient co-payments, ease access to medications, and optimize the choice of initial therapy may be effective tools in narrowing persistent gaps in the use of these and other clinically effective therapies.},

Those studies reporting mean/median costs of cerebrovascular diseases derived from patient-level data in a developed country setting were included.

Although the costing methodologies used were generally appropriate, only 5 studies were based on population-based studies, which are the gold standard study design when comparing incidence, outcome, and costs.{\textbar}This review showed large variations in the costs of stroke, mainly attributable to differences in the populations studied, methods, and cost categories included.

We compared the effects of the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine once daily with the diuretic combination co-amilozide on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in high-risk patients with hypertension. {METHODS}: We did a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial in Europe and Israel in 6321 patients aged 55-80 years with hypertension (blood pressure {\textgreater} or = 150/95 mm Hg, or {\textgreater} or = 160 mm Hg systolic). Patients had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. We randomly assigned patients nifedipine 30 mg in a long-acting gastrointestinal-transport-system ({GITS}) formulation (n=3157), or co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg [corrected] plus amiloride 2.5 mg; n=3164). Dose titration was by dose doubling, and addition of atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke. Analysis was done by intention to treat. {FINDINGS}: Primary outcomes occurred in 200 (6.3\%) patients in the nifedipine group and in 182 (5.8\%) in the co-amilozide group (18.2 vs 16.5 events per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.10 [95\% {CI} 0.91-1.34], p=0.35). Overall mean blood pressure fell from 173/99 mm Hg ({SD} 14/8) to 138/82 mm Hg (12/7). There was an 8\% excess of withdrawals from the nifedipine group because of peripheral oedema (725 vs 518, p{\textless}0.0001), but serious adverse events were more frequent in the co-amilozide group (880 vs 796, p=0.02). Deaths were mainly non-vascular (nifedipine 176 vs co-amilozide 172; p=0.81). 80\% of the primary events occurred in patients receiving randomised treatment (157 nifedipine, 147 co-amilozide, difference 0.33\% [-0.7 to 1.4]). {INTERPRETATION}: Nifedipine once daily and co-amilozide were equally effective in preventing overall cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Guidelines, including the 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association blood pressure guideline, recommend tighter control of systolic blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes. However, it is unclear whether intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure increases the incidence of chronic kidney disease in this population. We aimed to compare the effects of intensive systolic blood pressure control on incident chronic kidney disease in people with and without type 2 diabetes. {METHODS}: The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial ({SPRINT}) tested the effects of a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive intervention) versus a goal of less than 140 mm Hg (standard intervention) in people without diabetes. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ({ACCORD}) blood pressure trial tested a similar systolic blood pressure intervention in people with type 2 diabetes. Our study is a secondary analysis of limited access datasets from {SPRINT} and the {ACCORD} trial obtained from the National Institutes of Health. In participants without chronic kidney disease at baseline (n=4311 in the {ACCORD} trial; n=6715 in {SPRINT}), we related systolic blood pressure interventions (intensive vs standard) to incident chronic kidney disease (defined as {\textgreater}30\% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate [{eGFR}] to {\textless}60 {mL}/min per 1.73 m(2)). These trials are registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, numbers {NCT}01206062 ({SPRINT}) and {NCT}00000620 ({ACCORD} trial). {FINDINGS}: The average difference in systolic blood pressure between intensive and standard interventions was 13.9 mm Hg (95\% {CI} 13.4-14.4) in the {ACCORD} trial and 15.2 mm Hg (14.8-15.6) in {SPRINT}. At 3 years, the cumulative incidence of chronic kidney disease in the {ACCORD} trial was 10.0\% (95\% {CI} 8.8-11.4) with the intensive intervention and 4.1\% (3.3-5.1) with the standard intervention (absolute risk difference 5.9\%, 95\% {CI} 4.3-7.5). Corresponding values in {SPRINT} were 3.5\% (95\% {CI} 2.9-4.2) and 1.0\% (0.7-1.4; absolute risk difference 2.5\%, 95\% {CI} 1.8-3.2). The absolute risk difference was significantly higher in the {ACCORD} trial than in {SPRINT} (p=0.0001 for interaction). {INTERPRETATION}: Intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure increased the risk of incident chronic kidney disease in people with and without type 2 diabetes. However, the absolute risk of incident chronic kidney disease was higher in people with type 2 diabetes. Our findings suggest the need for vigilance in monitoring kidney function during intensive antihypertensive drug treatment, particularly in adults with diabetes. Long-term studies are needed to understand the clinical implications of antihypertensive treatment-related reductions in {eGFR}. {FUNDING}: National Institutes of Health.},

Patients with on-treatment {SBP}{\textless}144 mm Hg (lowest tertile) and {SBP}{\textgreater}157 (highest tertile) were compared with patients with average {SBP} between 144 and 157. {RESULTS}: During 2.02+/-1.65 years mean follow-up after incident stroke, 170 patients (31.4\%) died, 135 (25.0\%) from cardiovascular causes. In multivariate Cox analyses, adjusting for significant univariate predictors of mortality, compared with average {SBP} between 144 and 157, an average {SBP}{\textless}144 was a significant predictor of all-cause (hazard ratio, 1.81; 95\% confidence interval, 1.20-2.73) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 1.60; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02-2.54), whereas patients who had an average {SBP}{\textgreater}157 had no significant increased risk of death. {CONCLUSIONS}: Lower achieved {SBP} ({\textless}144 mm Hg) is associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality after initial stroke in hypertensive patients during short-term follow-up. Further study is required to determine ideal {SBP} goals after stroke. {CLINICAL} {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: {URL}: http://clinicaltrials.gov/. Unique identifier: {NCT}00338260.},

Sample sizes ranged from 2031 to 4084. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Self-reported prevalence of chronic conditions (including allergies, arthritis, congestive heart failure, chronic lung disease, hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease), sociodemographic data and the {SF}-36 Health Survey were obtained. The {SF}-36 scale and summary scores were estimated for individuals with and without selected chronic conditions and compared across countries using multivariate linear regression analyses. Adjustments were made for age, gender, marital status, education and the mode of {SF}-36 administration. {RESULTS}: More than half (55.1\%) of the pooled sample reported at least one chronic condition, and 30.2\% had more than one. Hypertension, allergies and arthritis were the most frequently reported conditions. The effect of ischemic heart disease on many of the physical health scales was noteworthy, as was the impact of diabetes on general health, or arthritis on bodily pain scale scores. Arthritis, chronic lung disease and congestive heart failure were the conditions with a higher impact on {SF}-36 physical summary score, whereas for hypertension and allergies, {HRQL} impact was low (comparing with a typical person without chronic conditions, deviation scores were around -4 points for the first group and -1 for the second). Differences between chronic conditions in terms of their impact on {SF}-36 mental summary score were low (deviation scores ranged between -1 and -2). {CONCLUSIONS}: Arthritis has the highest {HRQL} impact in the general population of the countries studied due to the combination of a high deviation score on physical scales and a high frequency. Impact of chronic conditions on {HRQL} was similar roughly across countries, despite important variation in prevalence. The use of {HRQL} measures such as the {SF}-36 should be useful to better characterize the global burden of disease.},

A retrospective analysis of information recorded in the drugs database of the Local Health Unit of Ravenna (Italy) was carried out on 7312 subjects receiving a first prescription for diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors or angiotensin {II} antagonists between 1 January and 31 December 1997. Patients were followed up for 3 years. All prescriptions of antihypertensive drugs filled during the follow-up periods were considered. The patients continuing or discontinuing the initial treatment, the duration of treatment, and the doses taken were all calculated, as well as main factors influencing the persistence rate. The drugs prescribed were predominantly {ACE}-inhibitors, followed by calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers and angiotensin {II} antagonists. A total of 57.9\% of patients continued their initial treatment during the 3-year follow-up period, 34.5\% discontinued the treatment, whilst 7.6\% were restarted on a treatment in the third year. Persistence with treatment was influenced by: age of patient (persistence rate increasing proportionately with advancing years), type of drug first prescribed (persistence rate higher with angiotensin {II} antagonists, progressively lower with {ACE}-inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics), gender of patient (persistence was better in males), age of general practitioner ({GP}) (the younger the {GP}, the better the persistence rate) and gender of {GP} (better stay-on-therapy rate with male {GP} prescribing). In the case of patients treated continuously, mean daily dose increased progressively over the 3 years. With adequate markers, helpful data can be collected from prescription claims databases for the purpose of monitoring the persistence of patients in continuing their medication, and the quality of antihypertensive treatment in a general practice setting.},

Although beta blockers have long been used for the treatment of {SCHD}, their efficacy was established in the era before widespread use of reperfusion interventions, modern medical therapy (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers), or preventive treatments (e.g., aspirin, statins). On the basis of these older data, beta blockers are assumed beneficial, and their use has been extrapolated beyond patients with heart failure and previous myocardial infarction, which provided the best evidence for efficacy. However, there are no randomized clinical trials demonstrating that beta blockers decrease clinical events in patients with {SCHD} in the modern era. Furthermore, these agents are associated with weight gain, problems with glycemic control, fatigue, and bronchospasm, underscoring the fact that their use is not without risk. In conclusion, data are currently lacking to support the widespread use of beta blockers for all {SCHD} patients, but contemporary data suggest that they be reserved for a well-defined high-risk group of patients with evidence of ongoing ischemia, left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, and perhaps some arrhythmias.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Hypertension is the leading preventable cause of premature death worldwide. We examined global disparities of hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control in 2010 and compared secular changes from 2000 to 2010. {METHODS}: We searched {MEDLINE} from 1995 through 2014 and supplemented with manual searches of retrieved article references. We included 135 population-based studies of 968 419 adults from 90 countries. Sex- and age-specific hypertension prevalences from each country were applied to population data to calculate regional and global numbers of hypertensive adults. Proportions of awareness, treatment, and control from each country were applied to hypertensive populations to obtain regional and global estimates. {RESULTS}: In 2010, 31.1\% (95\% confidence interval, 30.0\%-32.2\%) of the world's adults had hypertension; 28.5\% (27.3\%-29.7\%) in high-income countries and 31.5\% (30.2\%-32.9\%) in low- and middle-income countries. An estimated 1.39 (1.34-1.44) billion people had hypertension in 2010: 349 (337-361) million in high-income countries and 1.04 (0.99-1.09) billion in low- and middle-income countries. From 2000 to 2010, the age-standardized prevalence of hypertension decreased by 2.6\% in high-income countries, but increased by 7.7\% in low- and middle-income countries. During the same period, the proportions of awareness (58.2\% versus 67.0\%), treatment (44.5\% versus 55.6\%), and control (17.9\% versus 28.4\%) increased substantially in high-income countries, whereas awareness (32.3\% versus 37.9\%) and treatment (24.9\% versus 29.0\%) increased less, and control (8.4\% versus 7.7\%) even slightly decreased in low- and middle-income countries. {CONCLUSIONS}: Global hypertension disparities are large and increasing. Collaborative efforts are urgently needed to combat the emerging hypertension burden in low- and middle-income countries.},

However, the association of premature death resulting from these diseases with abdominal adiposity has not been widely studied, and findings are inconsistent. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: In a prospective cohort study of 44,636 women in the Nurses' Health Study, associations of abdominal adiposity with all-cause and cause-specific mortality were examined. During 16 years of follow-up, 3507 deaths were identified, including 751 cardiovascular deaths and 1748 cancer deaths. After adjustment for body mass index and potential confounders, the relative risks across the lowest to the highest waist circumference quintiles were 1.00, 1.11, 1.17, 1.31, and 1.79 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.47 to 1.98) for all-cause mortality; 1.00, 1.04, 1.04, 1.28, and 1.99 (95\% {CI}, 1.44 to 2.73) for {CVD} mortality; and 1.00, 1.18, 1.20, 1.34, and 1.63 (95\% {CI}, 1.32 to 2.01) for cancer mortality (all P{\textless}0.001 for trend).

	abstract = {Receptor binding studies suggest that combinations of calcium channel blockers may result in either enhanced or diminished pharmacological effects, but clinical data in hypertension are incomplete. In this study, we compared blood pressure reductions using nifedipine alone, nifedipine plus diltiazem, and nifedipine plus verapamil and determined whether combinations alter nifedipine pharmacokinetics. After determination of baseline blood pressures. 16 subjects with essential hypertension (12 men, 4 women; mean age, 48 years) received 30 mg/d open-label, sustained release nifedipine for 2 weeks. If still hypertensive (n = 16), they were randomized (double-blind) to receive either additional sustained release diltiazem or sustained release verapamil, both 180 mg/d, for 2 weeks and were then crossed-over for the final 2 weeks of the study. All medications were once-daily, extended-release formulations. Blood pressures and nifedipine plasma concentrations were measured during the final day of each treatment. Overall, each combination lowered mean systolic and diastolic pressures more than nifedipine alone. Mean supine diastolic pressures were significantly lower at 8 hours (77.6 versus 84.6 mm Hg, P = .001) and 12 hours (81.5 versus 87.1 mm Hg, P = .04) with nifedipine plus diltiazem than nifedipine plus verapamil. Mean nifedipine concentrations were inversely correlated with mean blood pressures. Mean nifedipine area under the curve values were greater with diltiazem than verapamil (1430 versus 1134 ng.h/{mL}, P = .026), with each greater than nifedipine alone (957 ng.h/{mL}). Nifedipine plus diltiazem had a greater antihypertensive effect than nifedipine plus verapamil. Diltiazem caused greater increases in nifedipine plasma concentrations than did verapamil. These data suggest that combined calcium channel blockers result in additive antihypertensive effects, perhaps because of a pharmacokinetic interaction.},

A review of the hemodynamic impact of arterial stiffness follows. A number of lifestyle changes and therapies that reduce arterial stiffness are presented, including weight loss, exercise, salt reduction, alcohol consumption, and neuroendocrine-directed therapies, such as those targeting the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, natriuretic peptides, insulin modulators, as well as novel therapies that target advanced glycation end products.},

Data extraction was conducted by two researchers. Data were analyzed with {MIX} 1.7 using random effects model. Results of the meta-analysis were expressed as differences of mean scores between hypertensive and normotensive individuals. {RESULTS}: Most of the 20 studies selected for the systematic review identified lower quality of life in patients with hypertension, but they were very heterogeneous in regard to selection criteria and comparison groups, limiting their external validity. The meta-analysis identified lower scores in hypertensive patients for physical [-2.43; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) -4.77 to -0.08] and mental (-1.68; 95\% {CI} -2.14 to -1.23) components.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ({ABPM}) in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in primary care settings in the United States is increasing. Insufficient information is available describing patients' experiences and acceptance of this technology in the United States, where medical insurance coverage of the procedure is often limited. The objective of this study was to describe patient satisfaction with {ABPM} performed in a primary care office in the United States, using modern {ABPM} technology. {METHODS}: Cross-sectional survey performed on consecutive patients referred to the {ABPM} service of the Family Care Center, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa from January 2001 to July 2003. Measures of patient satisfaction and acceptance with the device, comfort, and overall session were assessed via a 9-question, Likert-scale response survey. {RESULTS}: Since its inception two and a half years ago, 245 total {ABPM} sessions have been conducted in 235 unique patients. Of the 235 eligible respondents, 177 returned completed surveys, yielding a 75\% response rate. Three-fourths (75\%) of patients believed that undergoing the test was worthwhile considering the time and monetary cost involved, while most (90\%) reported they thought the information provided by the test would be helpful to their physician in making treatment decisions. Patients reporting that their physician had clearly explained the benefit of undergoing the testing were more likely to report that they thought the results of the test would be more helpful in making treatment decisions. Few patients (20\%) found that wearing the monitor was uncomfortable. {CONCLUSIONS}: When clinically indicated, clinicians should not hesitate to order {ABPM} testing for fear of subjecting patients to an uncomfortable test, or an uncovered insurance benefit. When ordering {ABPM}, they should be sure to educate the patient about the potential benefits of undergoing the testing. Most patients believe the test will provide useful information in making treatment decisions, despite probable lack of insurance coverage, and appear willing to experience some discomfort for the overall gain of the results obtained from undergoing the session.},

Hydrochlorothiazide was added if needed to control blood pressure. After a 24-week treatment period, all three groups had similar blood-pressure control, although fewer patients taking propranolol required hydrochlorothiazide. Patients taking captopril alone or in combination with a diuretic were least likely to withdraw from treatment because of adverse effects (8 percent vs. 20 percent for methyldopa and 13 percent for propranolol). The treatment groups were similar in scores for sleep dysfunction, visual memory, and social participation. However, patients taking captopril, as compared with patients taking methyldopa, scored significantly higher (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.01) on measures of general well-being, had fewer side effects, and had better scores for work performance, visual-motor functioning, and measures of life satisfaction. Patients taking propranolol also reported better work performance than patients taking methyldopa. Patients taking captopril reported fewer side effects and less sexual dysfunction than those taking propranolol and had greater improvement (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.01) on measures of general well-being. Our findings show that antihypertensive agents have different effects on the quality of life and that these can be meaningfully assessed with available psychosocial measures.},

There is an urgent need for a systematic framework to guide the development and application of e-{HPA} to ensure that the field develops in a scientifically sound, ethical, and efficient manner. {OBJECTIVES}: Building upon earlier frameworks of model development and utilization, we identify the emerging opportunities and challenges of e-{HPA}, propose a framework that enables us to realize these opportunities, address these challenges, and motivate e-{HPA} stakeholders to both adopt and continuously refine the framework as the applications of e-{HPA} emerge. {METHODS}: To achieve these objectives, 17 experts with diverse expertise including methodology, ethics, legal, regulation, and health care delivery systems were assembled to identify emerging opportunities and challenges of e-{HPA} and to propose a framework to guide the development and application of e-{HPA}. {FINDINGS}: The framework proposed by the panel includes three key domains where e-{HPA} differs qualitatively from earlier generations of models and algorithms (Data Barriers, Transparency, and {ETHICS}) and areas where current frameworks are insufficient to address the emerging opportunities and challenges of e-{HPA} (Regulation and Certification; and Education and Training). The following list of recommendations summarizes the key points of the framework: Data Barriers: Establish mechanisms within the scientific community to support data sharing for predictive model development and testing.Transparency: Set standards around e-{HPA} validation based on principles of scientific transparency and reproducibility. {ETHICS}: Develop both individual-centered and society-centered risk-benefit approaches to evaluate e-{HPA}.Regulation and Certification: Construct a self-regulation and certification framework within e-{HPA}.Education and Training: Make significant changes to medical, nursing, and paraprofessional curricula by including training for understanding, evaluating, and utilizing predictive models.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Dry cough is a common cause for the discontinuation of ramipril treatment. The aim of this pharmacoepidemiological study was to assess the incidence of ramipril-related cough among the Polish population and to characterize patients at risk of experiencing the adverse effect of cough during ramipril treatment. {MATERIAL}/{METHODS}: This was a prospective observational study involving 10,380 patients treated with ramipril for a period of no longer than 8 weeks, consisting of 3 visits: baseline, first follow-up (after 4-8 weeks) and second follow-up visit (after 4-8 weeks of cessation of ramipril, conducted only for evaluating coughing patients). {RESULTS}: The incidence of ramipril-related cough was 7.1\%. Logistic regression analysis identified female sex ({OR}=1.35), cigarette smoking ({OR}=2.50), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({OR}=1.70), asthma ({OR}=1.60) and previous history of tuberculosis ({OR}=6.20) to be significantly and independently associated with the onset of ramipril-related cough. Coughing subsided within a period of 2-20 days after ramipril was discontinued. In all patients reporting the appearance of cough within the first 5 days after therapy initiation, the adverse effect subsided after therapy discontinuation. If cough appeared within 6-10 days, it subsided after discontinuation in 81.6\% of subjects. Cough persisted in 30.4\% of those reporting later onset. {CONCLUSIONS}: 1. Female sex, cigarette smoking, {COPD}, asthma, and previous history of tuberculosis increase the risk of ramipril-related cough. 2. The later the cough occurs during treatment, the less often the drug is the causative agent and the cough and also less likely to disappear after discontinuation of ramipril.},

We sought to establish risk factors for relapse and determine whether fields available in an electronic health record ({EHR}) could be used to identify high-risk patients for targeted relapse prevention strategies. {DESIGN}: Retrospective cohort study. {SETTING}: Large clinical data warehouse at a 4-hospital healthcare organization. {PARTICIPANTS}: Data were gathered from January 2006 through October 2010. Subjects were all inpatient episodes of a positive C. difficile test where patients were available for 56 days of follow-up. {METHODS}: Relapse was defined as another positive test between 15 and 56 days after the initial test. Multivariable regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with {CDI} relapse. {RESULTS}: Eight hundred twenty-nine episodes met eligibility criteria, and 198 resulted in relapse (23.9\%). In the final multivariable analysis, risk of relapse was associated with age (odds ratio [{OR}], 1.02 per year [95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 1.01-1.03]), fluoroquinolone exposure in the 90 days before diagnosis ({OR}, 1.58 [95\% {CI}, 1.11-2.26]), intensive care unit stay in the 30 days before diagnosis ({OR}, 0.47 [95\% {CI}, 0.30-0.75]), cephalosporin ({OR}, 1.80 [95\% {CI}, 1.19-2.71]), proton pump inhibitor ({PPI}; {OR}, 1.55 [95\% {CI}, 1.05-2.29]), and metronidazole exposure after diagnosis ({OR}, 2.74 [95\% {CI}, 1.64-4.60]). A prediction model tuned to ensure a 50\% probability of relapse would flag 14.6\% of {CDI} episodes. {CONCLUSIONS}: Data from a comprehensive {EHR} can be used to identify patients at high risk for {CDI} relapse.

To determine incidence, the numerator was new cases of resistant hypertension and the denominator was person years of those with treated hypertension and at risk of developing resistant hypertension. To determine prevalence, the numerator was total number of cases with resistant hypertension and the denominator was those with treated hypertension. Prevalence and incidence were age standardised to the 2015 hypertensive population.Results The age standardised incidence of resistant hypertension increased from 0.93 cases per 100 person years (95\% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.00) in 1996 to a peak level of 2.07 cases per 100 person years (2.03 to 2.12) in 2004. Incidence then decreased to 0.42 cases per 100 person years (0.40 to 0.44) in 2015. Age standardised prevalence increased from 1.75\% (95\% confidence interval 1.66\% to 1.83\%) in 1995 to a peak of 7.76\% (7.70\% to 7.83\%) in 2007. Prevalence then plateaued and subsequently declined to 6.46\% (6.38\% to 6.54\%) in 2015. Compared with patients aged 65-69 years, those aged 80 or more years were more likely to have prevalent resistant hypertension throughout the study period.Conclusions Prevalent resistant hypertension has plateaued and decreased in recent years, consistent with a decrease in incidence from 2004 onwards. Despite this, resistant hypertension is common in the {UK} hypertensive population. Given the importance of hypertension as a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, reducing uncontrolled hypertension should remain a population health focus.},

In light of growing scientific interest in the treatment of this group, a multistakeholder think tank was convened to discuss the current state of knowledge, improve the care of these patients, and identify appropriate study populations for future observational and randomized trials in the field. Although recent epidemiologic studies in selected populations estimate that the prevalence of {aTRH} is 10\% to 15\% of hypertensive patients, further large-scale observational studies will be needed to better elucidate risk factors. To spur the development of therapies for {aTRH}, the development of an "{aTRH}" label for pharmacologic and device therapies with a developmental pathway including treatment added to the use of existing therapies is favored. Although demonstration of adequate {BP} lowering should be sufficient to gain Food and Drug Administration approval for therapies targeting {aTRH}, assessment of improvement in quality of life and cardiovascular outcomes is also desirable and considered in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services coverage decisions. Device trials under the {aTRH} label will need uniform and consistent processes for defining appropriate patient populations as well as postapproval registries assessing both long-term safety and duration of responses. Finally, patients with {aTRH} are likely to benefit from evaluation by a hypertension team to assure proper patient identification, diagnostic work-up, and therapeutic management before consideration of advanced or novel therapies to lower {BP}.},

Given the high prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine ({CAM}) and over-the-counter ({OTC}) medication use among this population, it is important to examine parental nondisclosure of these asthma management strategies. {METHOD}: One-time interview and 1-year retrospective medical record review with 228 parents of 5- to 12-year-old children with asthma enrolled from six pediatric primary care practices examining parental nondisclosure of {CAM} and {OTC} medication use, reasons for nondisclosure, medical record documentation of {CAM} usage, and association between parent-{HCP} relationship and nondisclosure. {RESULTS}: Seventy-one percent of parents reported using {CAM} and/or {OTC} medication for children's asthma management, and 54\% of those parents did not disclose usage. Seventy-five percent "did not think" to discuss it. Better parent-{HCP} relationship led to decreased nondisclosure. {DISCUSSION}: {HCPs} can play an important role in creating an environment where parents feel comfortable sharing information about their children's asthma management strategies in order to arrive at a shared asthma management plan for the child, leading to improved asthma health outcomes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Rational medical decisions should be based on the best possible evidence. Clinical trial results, however, may not reflect conditions in actual practice. In hypertension, for example, trials indicate equivalent antihypertensive efficacy and safety for many medications, yet blood pressure frequently remains uncontrolled, perhaps owing to poor compliance. This paper examines the effect of initial choice of treatment on persistence with therapy in actual practice. {METHODS}: The authors examined all outpatient prescriptions for antihypertensive medications filled in Saskatchewan between 1989 and 1994 by over 22,000 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension whose initial treatment was with a diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker or angiotensin-converting-enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitor. Rates of persistence over the first year of treatment were compared. {RESULTS}: After 6 months, persistence with therapy was poor and differed according to the class of initial therapeutic agent: 80\% for diuretics, 85\% for beta-blockers, 86\% for calcium-channel blockers and 89\% for {ACE} inhibitors (p {\textless} 0.001). These differences remained significant when age, sex and health status in the previous year were controlled for. Changes in the therapeutic regimen were also associated with lack of persistence. {INTERPRETATION}: A relation not seen in clinical trials--between persistence with treatment and initial antihypertensive medication prescribed--was found in actual practice. This relation also indicates the importance of real-world studies for evidence-based medicine.},

The Vita-Stat readings also correlated poorly with the mercury readings of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (intermachine differences). The variability in readings recorded by the Vita-Stat were striking, with differences of up to 60 mm Hg from the mercury readings. More than half (63.2\%) of the subjects had Vita-Stat readings that were more than 5 mm Hg different from the mercury readings. Vita-Stat systolic readings were usually lower than mercury readings and also varied by as much as 60 mm Hg below in one patient to 58 mm Hg above the mercury reading in another. The sensitivity of the Vita-Stat in correctly diagnosing hypertension was 0.26; the negative predictive value was 0.45. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our data suggest that the Vita-Stat is not only inconsistent but inaccurate in measuring blood pressure in the ambulatory patient and is, therefore, not appropriate to use as a monitoring device.},

In this prospective study of 88 consecutive patients referred to a university clinic for resistant hypertension, we determined the 24-hour urinary aldosterone excretion during high dietary salt ingestion, baseline plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone in all subjects. Primary hyperaldosteronism was confirmed if plasma renin activity was {\textless}1.0 ng/{mL} per hour and urinary aldosterone was {\textgreater}12 microg/24-hour during high urinary sodium excretion ({\textgreater}200 {mEq}/24-hour).

Of the 14 subjects with confirmed hyperaldosteronism who have been treated with spironolactone, all have manifested a significant reduction in blood pressure. In this population, an elevated plasma aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio ({\textgreater}20) had a sensitivity of 89\% and a specificity of 71\% with a corresponding positive predictive value of 44\% and a negative predictive value of 96\%. These data provide strong evidence that hyperaldosteronism is a common cause of resistant hypertension in black and white subjects. The accuracy of these results is strengthened by having done suppression testing of all evaluated subjects.},

	abstract = {Patients with heart failure ({HF}) are at high risk of hospitalization or death. The objective of this study was to develop prediction models to identify patients with {HF} at highest risk for hospitalization or death. Using clinical and administrative databases, we identified 198,460 patients who received care from the Veterans Health Administration and had {\textgreater}/=1 primary or secondary diagnosis of {HF} that occurred within 1 year before June 1, 2009. We then tracked their outcomes of hospitalization and death during the subsequent 30 days and 1 year. Predictor variables chosen from 6 clinically relevant categories of sociodemographics, medical conditions, vital signs, use of health services, laboratory tests, and medications were used in multinomial regression models to predict outcomes of hospitalization and death. In patients who were in the {\textgreater}/=95th predicted risk percentile, observed event rates of hospitalization or death within 30 days and 1 year were 27\% and 80\% respectively, compared to population averages of 5\% and 31\%, respectively. The c-statistics for the 30-day outcomes were 0.82, 0.80, and 0.80 for hospitalization, death, and hospitalization or death, respectively, and 0.82, 0.76, and 0.77, respectively, for 1-year outcomes. In conclusion, prediction models using electronic health records can accurately identify patients who are at highest risk for hospitalization or death. This information can be used to assist care managers in selecting patients for interventions to decrease their risk of hospitalization or death.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to compare the efficacy of a patient-directed management strategy with office-based management in maintaining blood pressure control in patients with chronic stable hypertension using a randomized trial of two months duration. The subjects had chronic stable essential hypertension without secondary causes or unstable cardiovascular disease and were selected through the offices of 11 family physicians and a tertiary care hypertension research unit. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to either a patient-directed management strategy using home blood pressure monitoring to adjust drug therapy if readings consistently exceeded defined limits, or office-based management through physician visits. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean arterial pressure as determined by automatic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Secondary endpoints were changes in compliance, quality of life, and health care resource use. Ninety-one potential subjects were screened and 31 were randomized. Subjects in the patient-directed management group employed the drug adjustment protocols appropriately without complications. A significant difference in change in mean blood pressure was observed, favoring the patient-directed management (-0.95 mm Hg and +1.90 mm Hg, respectively, for patient-directed management and office-based management, P = .039). Compliance rates and quality of life scores were not significantly different between groups. Physician visits were more frequent in the patient-directed management group (1.05 v 0.20 visits/8 weeks, respectively, for patient-directed management and office-based management groups, P = .045). A patient-directed hypertensive management strategy may be feasible for patients with chronic stable hypertension. Such a strategy may improve blood pressure control compared with usual office-based care. However, physician visits may be increased using this strategy, at least in the short term.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have challenged the notion that "lower is better" for blood pressure in relation to vascular events and mortality in patients with vascular disease, whereas practice guidelines currently recommend to lower blood pressure to {\textless}130/80 mm Hg. We reassessed this J-curved relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with various manifestations of vascular disease. For this purpose, 5788 patients with symptomatic vascular disease enrolled in the Secondary Manifestations of Arterial Disease Study were followed-up for the occurrence of new vascular events (ie, myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death) and all-cause mortality. During a median of 5.0 years (interquartile range: 2.6-8.1 years), 788 patients experienced a new vascular event, and 779 died. Overall, the covariate-adjusted relationship between mean baseline systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure and the occurrence of vascular events followed a J-curve with increased event rates above and below the nadir blood pressure of 143/82 mm Hg. A similar nonlinear relationship was found for diastolic pressure and all-cause mortality. Elevated blood pressure was not associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with recently diagnosed coronary artery disease, {\textgreater}/=65 years, and having {\textgreater}60 mm Hg pulse pressure. Importantly, especially in these subgroups, low blood pressure could also be a symptom rather than a cause of disease. Blood pressure level below and above 143/82 mm Hg is, thus, an independent risk factor for recurrent events in patients with manifest vascular disease. Uncertainty of whether this association is causal provides a strong rationale for trials evaluating blood pressure treatment targets.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The last few years have witnessed an increasing number of clinical research networks ({CRNs}) focused on building large collections of data from electronic health records ({EHRs}), claims, and patient-reported outcomes ({PROs}). Many of these {CRNs} provide a service for the discovery of research cohorts with various health conditions, which is especially useful for rare diseases. Supporting patient privacy can enhance the scalability and efficiency of such processes; however, current practice mainly relies on policy, such as guidelines defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ({HIPAA}), which are insufficient for {CRNs} (e.g., {HIPAA} does not require encryption of data - which can mitigate insider threats). By combining policy with privacy enhancing technologies we can enhance the trustworthiness of {CRNs}. The goal of this research is to determine if searchable encryption can instill privacy in {CRNs} without sacrificing their usability. {METHODS}: We developed a technique, implemented in working software to enable privacy-preserving cohort discovery ({PPCD}) services in large distributed {CRNs} based on elliptic curve cryptography ({ECC}). This technique also incorporates a block indexing strategy to improve the performance (in terms of computational running time) of {PPCD}. We evaluated the {PPCD} service with three real cohort definitions: (1) elderly cervical cancer patients who underwent radical hysterectomy, (2) oropharyngeal and tongue cancer patients who underwent robotic transoral surgery, and (3) female breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy) with varied query complexity. These definitions were tested in an encrypted database of 7.1 million records derived from the publically available Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project ({HCUP}) Nationwide Inpatient Sample ({NIS}). We assessed the performance of the {PPCD} service in terms of (1) accuracy in cohort discovery, (2) computational running time, and (3) privacy afforded to the underlying records during {PPCD}. {RESULTS}: The empirical results indicate that the proposed {PPCD} can execute cohort discovery queries in a reasonable amount of time, with query runtime in the range of 165-262s for the 3 use cases, with zero compromise in accuracy. We further show that the search performance is practical because it supports a highly parallelized design for secure evaluation over encrypted records. Additionally, our security analysis shows that the proposed construction is resilient to standard adversaries. {CONCLUSIONS}: {PPCD} services can be designed for clinical research networks. The security construction presented in this work specifically achieves high privacy guarantees by preventing both threats originating from within and beyond the network.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To investigate the association between the use of fluoroquinolone agents and the risk of tendinitis in a large population-based case-control study. {METHODS}: The study was performed by linking automated health databases from the Region of Lombardia, Italy. Cases were patients aged {\textgreater} or =18 years who had a hospital discharge diagnosis of non-traumatic tendinitis in 2002-3. For each case, up to five controls were randomly selected among those eligible for inclusion in the study. A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratio of tendinitis associated with the current, recent and past use of fluoroquinolones. Odds ratios were adjusted for exposure to other antibacterials and other drugs. {RESULTS}: 22,194 cases and 104,906 controls met the inclusion criteria. Current use of fluoroquinolones significantly increased the risk of tendon disorders as a whole (odds ratio [{OR}] = 1.7; 95\% {CI} 1.4, 2.0), tendon rupture ({OR} = 1.3; 95\% {CI} 1.0, 1.8) and rupture of the Achilles' tendon ({OR} = 4.1; 95\% {CI} 1.8, 9.6). Concomitant use of corticosteroids and fluoroquinolones increased the risk of both tendon rupture ({OR} = 3.1; 95\% {CI} 1.5, 6.3) and rupture of the Achilles' tendon ({OR} = 43.2; 95\% {CI} 5.5, 341.1). {DISCUSSION}: Evidence that exposure to fluoroquinolones is associated with the sudden occurrence of tendinitis is supported by this large population-based study. We can estimate that a single case of rupture of the Achilles' tendon would occur for every 5958 persons treated with fluoroquinolones (95\% {CI} 2148, 23,085). The corresponding number needed to harm is 979 (95\% {CI} 122, 9172) for patients who concomitantly use corticosteroids and 1638 (95\% {CI} 351, 8843) for those aged {\textgreater}60 years. {CONCLUSION}: Clinicians should be aware of this adverse effect, and the increased risk for fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis in elderly patients with corticosteroid use must be considered when these agents are prescribed.},

Several guidelines recommend lower {BP} goals and specific drug classes for these patients. The overviews reported herein were performed to formally compare the effects on cardiovascular events and death of different {BP}-lowering regimens in individuals with and without diabetes. {METHODS}: Twenty-seven randomized trials (N = 158 709 participants) that included 33 395 individuals with diabetes and 125 314 without diabetes contributed to these analyses. For each outcome and each comparison summary, estimates of effect and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated for patients with and without diabetes using a random-effects model. The constancy of the effects of each treatment regimen in participants with and without diabetes was examined using chi(2) tests of homogeneity. {RESULTS}: Total major cardiovascular events were reduced to a comparable extent in individuals with and without diabetes by regimens based on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics/beta-blockers (P {\textgreater} .19 for all by chi(2) test of homogeneity). There was limited evidence that lower {BP} goals produced larger reductions in total major cardiovascular events in individuals with vs without diabetes (P = .03 by chi(2) test of homogeneity). {CONCLUSIONS}: These overviews showed that the short- to-medium-term effects on major cardiovascular events of the {BP}-lowering regimens studied were broadly comparable for patients with and without diabetes. Different effects of regimens on intermediate renal outcomes not evaluated in these overviews may still provide a rationale for using specific drug classes in patients with diabetes.},

No comprehensive update of disease burden worldwide incorporating a systematic reassessment of disease and injury-specific epidemiology has been done since the 1990 study. We aimed to calculate disease burden worldwide and for 21 regions for 1990, 2005, and 2010 with methods to enable meaningful comparisons over time. {METHODS}: We calculated {DALYs} as the sum of years of life lost ({YLLs}) and years lived with disability ({YLDs}). {DALYs} were calculated for 291 causes, 20 age groups, both sexes, and for 187 countries, and aggregated to regional and global estimates of disease burden for three points in time with strictly comparable definitions and methods. {YLLs} were calculated from age-sex-country-time-specific estimates of mortality by cause, with death by standardised lost life expectancy at each age. {YLDs} were calculated as prevalence of 1160 disabling sequelae, by age, sex, and cause, and weighted by new disability weights for each health state. Neither {YLLs} nor {YLDs} were age-weighted or discounted. Uncertainty around cause-specific {DALYs} was calculated incorporating uncertainty in levels of all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, prevalence, and disability weights. {FINDINGS}: Global {DALYs} remained stable from 1990 (2.503 billion) to 2010 (2.490 billion). Crude {DALYs} per 1000 decreased by 23\% (472 per 1000 to 361 per 1000). An important shift has occurred in {DALY} composition with the contribution of deaths and disability among children (younger than 5 years of age) declining from 41\% of global {DALYs} in 1990 to 25\% in 2010. {YLLs} typically account for about half of disease burden in more developed regions (high-income Asia Pacific, western Europe, high-income North America, and Australasia), rising to over 80\% of {DALYs} in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1990, 47\% of {DALYs} worldwide were from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, 43\% from non-communicable diseases, and 10\% from injuries. By 2010, this had shifted to 35\%, 54\%, and 11\%, respectively. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of {DALYs} worldwide in 2010 (up from fourth rank in 1990, increasing by 29\%), followed by lower respiratory infections (top rank in 1990; 44\% decline in {DALYs}), stroke (fifth in 1990; 19\% increase), diarrhoeal diseases (second in 1990; 51\% decrease), and {HIV}/{AIDS} (33rd in 1990; 351\% increase). Major depressive disorder increased from 15th to 11th rank (37\% increase) and road injury from 12th to 10th rank (34\% increase). Substantial heterogeneity exists in rankings of leading causes of disease burden among regions. {INTERPRETATION}: Global disease burden has continued to shift away from communicable to non-communicable diseases and from premature death to years lived with disability. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, many communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders remain the dominant causes of disease burden. The rising burden from mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes will impose new challenges on health systems. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of understanding local burden of disease and setting goals and targets for the post-2015 agenda taking such patterns into account. Because of improved definitions, methods, and data, these results for 1990 and 2010 supersede all previously published Global Burden of Disease results. {FUNDING}: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to elucidate the long-term prognostic significance of ambulatory blood pressure. Ambulatory and casual blood pressure values were obtained from 1332 subjects (872 women and 460 men) aged {\textgreater}or=40 years from the general population of a rural Japanese community. Survival was then followed for 14 370 patient years and analyzed by a Cox hazard model adjusted for possible confounding factors. There were 72 cardiovascular deaths during the 10.8-year follow-up. The relationship between 24-hour systolic blood pressure and the cardiovascular mortality risk was U-shaped in the first 5 years, then changed to J-shaped over the rest of the 10.8-year follow-up. After censoring the first 2 years of data, the risk flattened until it again increased for the fifth quintile of 24-hour systolic blood pressure for the 10.8-year follow-up period. For 24-hour diastolic blood pressure, the J-shaped relationship remained unchanged, regardless of follow-up duration and censoring. Ambulatory systolic blood pressure values consistently showed stronger predictive power for cardiovascular mortality risk than did casual systolic blood pressure in the 10.8-year follow-up data, whereas such relationships became more marked after censoring the first 2 years. When nighttime and daytime systolic blood pressure values were simultaneously included in the same Cox model, only nighttime blood pressure significantly predicted the cardiovascular mortality risk for the 10.8-year follow-up data. We conclude that the relationship between ambulatory systolic blood pressure and cardiovascular mortality is not U-shaped or J-shaped, and that nighttime blood pressure has better prognostic value than daytime blood pressure.},

The first coprimary outcome was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; the second coprimary outcome additionally included resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart failure, and revascularization. The median follow-up was 5.6 years. {RESULTS}: The mean blood pressure of the participants at baseline was 138.1/81.9 mm Hg; the decrease in blood pressure was 6.0/3.0 mm Hg greater in the active-treatment group than in the placebo group. The first coprimary outcome occurred in 260 participants (4.1\%) in the active-treatment group and in 279 (4.4\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.79 to 1.10; P=0.40); the second coprimary outcome occurred in 312 participants (4.9\%) and 328 participants (5.2\%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95\% {CI}, 0.81 to 1.11; P=0.51). In one of the three prespecified hypothesis-based subgroups, participants in the subgroup for the upper third of systolic blood pressure ({\textgreater}143.5 mm Hg) who were in the active-treatment group had significantly lower rates of the first and second coprimary outcomes than those in the placebo group; effects were neutral in the middle and lower thirds (P=0.02 and P=0.009, respectively, for trend in the two outcomes). {CONCLUSIONS}: Therapy with candesartan at a dose of 16 mg per day plus hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 12.5 mg per day was not associated with a lower rate of major cardiovascular events than placebo among persons at intermediate risk who did not have cardiovascular disease.

Angiotensin {II} and reactive oxygen species are validated risk factors for {AF} in patients, but the molecular pathways connecting reactive oxygen species and {AF} are unknown. The Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase {II} ({CaMKII}) has recently emerged as a reactive oxygen species-activated proarrhythmic signal, so we hypothesized that oxidized {CaMKIIdelta} could contribute to {AF}. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We found that oxidized {CaMKII} was increased in atria from {AF} patients compared with patients in sinus rhythm and from mice infused with angiotensin {II} compared with mice infused with saline. Angiotensin {II}-treated mice had increased susceptibility to {AF} compared with saline-treated wild-type mice, establishing angiotensin {II} as a risk factor for {AF} in mice. Knock-in mice lacking critical oxidation sites in {CaMKIIdelta} ({MM}-{VV}) and mice with myocardium-restricted transgenic overexpression of methionine sulfoxide reductase A, an enzyme that reduces oxidized {CaMKII}, were resistant to {AF} induction after angiotensin {II} infusion. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our studies suggest that {CaMKII} is a molecular signal that couples increased reactive oxygen species with {AF} and that therapeutic strategies to decrease oxidized {CaMKII} may prevent or reduce {AF}.},

We evaluated the persistence of mortality benefit of these agents after the end of clinical trials, when all of the patients were advised to take the same open-label therapy. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials using blood pressure-lowering medications, used in patients with hypertension, myocardial infarction, or left ventricular systolic dysfunction, (n=18; 132 854 patients; 11 988 deaths) when a second report describing results after the end of the trial was available. During the randomized (first) phase, 80\% (interquartile range: 75\% to 83\%) of the patients randomized to receive active therapy actually received it compared with 16\% (interquartile range: 7\% to 22\%) of those randomized to control. In this phase, mortality was lower in the intervention group (odds ratio: 0.84 [95\% {CI}: 0.79 to 0.90]; P{\textless}0.0001). Mortality was also lower during the open-label follow-up (second) phase (odds ratio: 0.85 [95\% {CI}: 0.79 to 0.91]; P{\textless}0.0001), when all of the patients were advised to take the same therapy, and rates of receiving active therapy were similar in the 2 groups (59\% [interquartile range: 46\% to 77\%], among those originally randomized to active, and 43\% [interquartile range: 20\% to 68\%], in the control). Several sensitivity analyses indicated stability of the effects. In studies of antihypertensive medications, a decrease in overall mortality persists after the end of trial phase, when most patients in both the intervention and control groups receive active therapy. These analyses imply that earlier intervention would result in better clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {The immunoglobin heavy chain variable region ({VH}) gene usage in multiple myeloma ({MM}) has not been reported, although a few studies have incidentally identified the {VH} gene rearranged in small cohorts of {MM} patients. We used a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction based technique to analyze the {VH} gene usage in {MM}. The {VH} sequences were obtained after amplification of bone marrow {cDNA} using the seven {VH} family-specific and constant region primers. The {VH} sequences of 72 patients were successfully identified. The frequency of {VH} family usage in decreasing order was {VH}3{\textgreater}{VH}4{\textgreater}{VH}1{\textgreater}{VH}5{\textgreater}{VH}2{\textgreater}{VH}6{\textgreater}{VH}7 and corresponded to the functional germline complexity of the {VH} families. Individual {VH} genes ({VH}1-69, {VH}3-9, {VH}3-23, and {VH}3-30) were overrepresented in our cohort of {MM} patients; some {VH} genes [{VH}3-49, {VH}3-53, and {VH}4.21 ({VH}4-34)], which are rearranged with increased frequency in normal circulating B cells, autoimmune diseases, and other B-cell malignancies, were not detected in any {MM} patient. Compared with germline sequences, an average of 8.8\% (range, 2.7\% to 16.5\%) of the nucleotides had evidence of mutation within each {VH} sequence. Based on these results, we conclude that (1) the {VH} gene usage in {MM} is unique compared with other malignant and nonmalignant B-cell populations, (2) the physiologic process of clonal deletion functions to remove clones that have rearranged {VH} genes ({VH}4.21) capable of expressing antibodies, which recognize self-antigens, and (3) the complete lack of {VH}4.21 gene rearrangement may help to partially explain the paucity of autoimmune phenomena in {MM}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Hypertension is widely prevalent yet remains uncontrolled in nearly half of {US} hypertensive adults. Treatment intensification for hypertension reduces rates of major cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, but clinical inertia remains a notable impediment to further improving hypertension control. This study examines the likelihood and determinants of treatment intensification with new medication in {US} ambulatory medical care. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Using the nationally representative National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2005-2012) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2005-2011), we identified adult primary care visits with diagnosed hypertension and documented blood pressure exceeding goal targets and assessed the weighted prevalence and odds ratios of treatment intensification by initiation or addition of new medication. Approximately 41.7 million yearly primary care visits (crude N: 14 064, 2005-2012) occurred among {US} hypertensive adults with documented blood pressure {\textgreater}/=140/90 mm Hg, where treatment intensification may be beneficial. However, only 7.0 million of these visits (95\% confidence interval 6.2-7.8 million) received treatment intensification with new medication, a weighted prevalence of 16.8\% (15.8\% to 17.9\%). This proportion was consistently low and decreased over time. This decline was largely driven by decreasing medication initiation levels among patients on no previous hypertension medications from 31.8\% (26.0\% to 38.4\%) in 2007 to 17.4\% (14.0\% to 21.4\%) in 2012, while medication addition levels remained more stable over time. {CONCLUSIONS}: {US} hypertensive adults received treatment intensification with new medication in only 1 out of 6 primary care visits, a fraction that is declining over time. A profound increase in intensification remains a vast opportunity to maximally reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality nationwide.},

This instrument evaluated the current clinical pharmacy services provided in the medical office. {TPB} instruments were developed that measured beliefs concerning implementation of a clinical pharmacy intervention for either blood pressure or asthma. The pharmacy services and {TPB} surveys were then administered to physicians and pharmacists in 32 primary care offices throughout the United States. {RESULTS}: Physicians returned 321 (35.9\%) surveys, while pharmacists returned 40 (75.5\%). The Cronbach's alpha coefficients generally ranged from 0.65 to 0.98. {TPB} subscale scores were lower in offices rated with lower pharmacy service scores, but these differences were not statistically significant. There was no correlation between clinical pharmacy service score and providers' {TPB} subscale scores. In both the hypertension and asthma groups, pharmacists scores were significantly higher than physicians' scores on the attitudes subscale in the multivariate analysis (P {\textless} 0.001 and P {\textless} 0.05, respectively). {CONCLUSIONS}: Pharmacists consistently scored higher than physicians on the {TPB}, indicating that they felt the hypertension or asthma intervention would be more straightforward for them to implement than did physicians. There was no significant correlation between clinical pharmacy service scores and attitudes toward implementing a future physician/pharmacist collaborative intervention using the {TPB}. Future studies should investigate the ability of the {TPB} instrument to predict implementation of a similar intervention in offices of physicians never exposed to clinical pharmacy services.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes ({ABCD}) Trial is a prospective randomized blinded clinical trial that compares the effects of intensive versus moderate blood pressure control on the incidence and progression of type 2 diabetic complications. The current article discusses the results of 5.3 years of follow-up of 470 patients with hypertension and evaluates the effects of intensive and moderate blood pressure therapy using nisoldipine versus enalapril as the initial antihypertensive medication for nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: The 470 hypertensive subjects, defined as having a baseline diastolic blood pressure of {\textgreater} or = 90 {mmHg}, were randomized to intensive blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure goal of 75 {mmHg}) versus moderate blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure goal of 80-89 {mmHg}). {RESULTS}: The mean blood pressure achieved was 132/78 {mmHg} in the intensive group and 138/86 {mmHg} in the moderate control group. During the 5-year follow-up period, no difference was observed between intensive versus moderate blood pressure control and those randomized to nisoldipine versus enalapril with regard to the change in creatinine clearance. After the first year of antihypertensive treatment, creatinine clearance stabilized in both the intensive and moderate blood pressure control groups in those patients with baseline normo- or microalbuminuria. In contrast, patients starting with overt albuminuria demonstrated a steady decline in creatinine clearance of 5-6 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2 per year throughout the follow-up period whether they were on intensive or moderate therapy. There was also no difference between the interventions with regard to individuals progressing from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria (25\% intensive therapy vs. 18\% moderate therapy, P = 0.20) or microalbuminuria to overt albuminuria (16\% intensive therapy vs. 23\% moderate therapy, P = 0.28). Intensive therapy demonstrated a lower overall incidence of deaths, 5.5 vs. 10.7\%, P = 0.037. Over a 5-year follow-up period, there was no difference between the intensive and moderate groups with regard to the progression of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. In addition, the use of nisoldipine versus enalapril had no differential effect on diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. {CONCLUSIONS}: Blood pressure control of 138/86 or 132/78 {mmHg} with either nisoldipine or enalapril as the initial antihypertensive medication appeared to stabilize renal function in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients without overt albuminuria over a 5-year period. The more intensive blood pressure control decreased all-cause mortality.},

Additional references were identified from literature citations. {STUDY} {SELECTION}: All prospective studies assessing cardiovascular outcomes or comparing morning to evening administration of antihypertensives were selected. {DATA} {SYNTHESIS}: Compared with morning administration, dosing one or more antihypertensive medications at bedtime helps induce a normal circadian blood pressure pattern and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in individuals with hypertension. Similar results have been reported in high-risk individuals with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and resistant hypertension. A lack of diversity among studied populations and reliance on subgroup analyses are among the limitations of these data. All antihypertensive medications have not been studied in chronotherapy and do not uniformly achieve desired results. The most substantial evidence exists for medications affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. {CONCLUSIONS}: Despite growing evidence and promise as a cost-effective strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk, chronotherapy is not uniformly recommended in the treatment of hypertension. Careful selection of patients and antihypertensives for chronotherapy is required. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the definitive impact of chronotherapy on cardiovascular outcomes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Estimation of the number and rate of deaths by age and sex is a key first stage for calculation of the burden of disease in order to constrain estimates of cause-specific mortality and to measure premature mortality in populations. We aimed to estimate life tables and annual numbers of deaths for 187 countries from 1970 to 2010. {METHODS}: We estimated trends in under-5 mortality rate (children aged 0-4 years) and probability of adult death (15-59 years) for each country with all available data. Death registration data were available for more than 100 countries and we corrected for undercount with improved death distribution methods. We applied refined methods to survey data on sibling survival that correct for survivor, zero-sibling, and recall bias. We separately estimated mortality from natural disasters and wars. We generated final estimates of under-5 mortality and adult mortality from the data with Gaussian process regression. We used these results as input parameters in a relational model life table system. We developed a model to extrapolate mortality to 110 years of age. All death rates and numbers have been estimated with 95\% uncertainty intervals (95\% {UIs}). {FINDINGS}: From 1970 to 2010, global male life expectancy at birth increased from 56.4 years (95\% {UI} 55.5-57.2) to 67.5 years (66.9-68.1) and global female life expectancy at birth increased from 61.2 years (60.2-62.0) to 73.3 years (72.8-73.8). Life expectancy at birth rose by 3-4 years every decade from 1970, apart from during the 1990s (increase in male life expectancy of 1.4 years and in female life expectancy of 1.6 years). Substantial reductions in mortality occurred in eastern and southern sub-Saharan Africa since 2004, coinciding with increased coverage of antiretroviral therapy and preventive measures against malaria. Sex-specific changes in life expectancy from 1970 to 2010 ranged from gains of 23-29 years in the Maldives and Bhutan to declines of 1-7 years in Belarus, Lesotho, Ukraine, and Zimbabwe. Globally, 52.8 million (95\% {UI} 51.6-54.1 million) deaths occurred in 2010, which is about 13.5\% more than occurred in 1990 (46.5 million [45.7-47.4 million]), and 21.9\% more than occurred in 1970 (43.3 million [42.2-44.6 million]). Proportionally more deaths in 2010 occurred at age 70 years and older (42.8\% in 2010 vs 33.1\% in 1990), and 22.9\% occurred at 80 years or older. Deaths in children younger than 5 years declined by almost 60\% since 1970 (16.4 million [16.1-16.7 million] in 1970 vs 6.8 million [6.6-7.1 million] in 2010), especially at ages 1-59 months (10.8 million [10.4-11.1 million] in 1970 vs 4.0 million [3.8-4.2 million] in 2010). In all regions, including those most affected by {HIV}/{AIDS}, we noted increases in mean ages at death. {INTERPRETATION}: Despite global and regional health crises, global life expectancy has increased continuously and substantially in the past 40 years. Yet substantial heterogeneity exists across age groups, among countries, and over different decades. 179 of 187 countries have had increases in life expectancy after the slowdown in progress in the 1990s. Efforts should be directed to reduce mortality in low-income and middle-income countries. Potential underestimation of achievement of the Millennium Development Goal 4 might result from limitations of demographic data on child mortality for the most recent time period. Improvement of civil registration system worldwide is crucial for better tracking of global mortality. {FUNDING}: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

Medication nonadherence has been linked to pill burden from the quantity of medications; however, medication regimens with similar quantities of medications vary in complexity due to multiple dosage forms, frequency of dosing, and additional usage directions. Thus, a simple medication count ignores medication regimen complexity, especially as it pertains to a patient-level perspective that includes prescription and over-the-counter medications. A gap exists in the study of a patient-level medication regimen complexity metric across disease-specific populations. {OBJECTIVE}: The goal of this study was to implement the quantitative Medication Regimen Complexity Index ({MRCI}) at the patient level in defined populations with chronic disease (geriatric depression, {HIV}, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension). Patient-level medication regimen complexity included all prescribed medications and over-the-counter medications documented in the electronic medication list. {METHODS}: Using electronic medical records at the University of Colorado Hospital ambulatory clinics, we sampled 4 retrospective cohorts of adult patients in active care in 2011 with a qualifying medical diagnosis and prescribed disease-specific medication. Samples were randomly selected from all qualifying patients; de-identified information was coded using the {MRCI}. {RESULTS}: Cohort-defining disease-specific prescription medications (eg, antidepressants for the depression-defined cohort) contributed {\textless}20\% to the total patient-level complexity {MRCI} score; the {MRCI} score was dominated by complexity associated with all other prescription medications. Within disease-specific cohorts, {MRCI} scores differentiated patients with the highest and lowest medication counts, comorbidity counts, and the Charlson comorbidity index scores. For example, geriatric depression patients had a highest quartile mean {MRCI} score of 41 and a lowest quartile mean {MRCI} score of 13. Between disease-specific cohorts, high and low {MRCI} scores differed because each cohort had its own {MRCI} ranges. For example, highest quartile {MRCI} scores varied from a mean {MRCI} score of 41 (geriatric depression) to 30 (hypertension); lowest quartile scores ranged from a mean {MRCI} score of 7 (hypertension and {HIV}) to 13 (geriatric depression). {CONCLUSIONS}: {MRCI} components of dosing frequency and prescribed medications outside of the cohort-defining disease medications contributed the most to the patient-level scores. Thus, chronic disease management programs may want to consider all medications that patients are taking and examine ways to reduce complexity, such as reducing multiple dosing frequencies when possible. {MRCI} scores differentiated high and low patient-level complexity measures, representing possible utility as a prospective tool to identify target patients for intervention. Future work includes simplifying the {MRCI} and enhancing the scores with medication risk factors, as well as explicitly linking to adherence and health services.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Iloprost, a prostacyclin analog, reduces hepatic microcirculatory damage after ischemia-reperfusion injury in animal liver models. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the portal flow velocity changes after Iloprost infusion in patients with systemic sclerosis and Raynaud's phenomenon, who usually have increased risk of microvascular thrombosis and transient liver disturbances. {PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: Fifteen patients (3 males and 12 females, median age 58 years, range 47-66 years), with systemic sclerosis and Raynaud's phenomenon, were exclusively treated with an infusion of Iloprost (2 ng/kg/min, 6 h/day) for 5 days. In each subject, the portal flow velocity ({PV}, cm/sec) and portal flow volume ({PFV}, {mL}/min) were obtained by using portal color Doppler ultrasonography equipment. {RESULTS}: Iloprost administration significantly (p{\textless}0.001) increased both the {PV} (23.6+/-3.4 cmlsec vs. 29.1+/-3.9 cm/sec) and {PFV} (1748.8+/-310. 7 {mL}/min vs. 2254.9+/-404.1 {mL}/min) values. {CONCLUSION}: Hepatic perfusion significantly improved after Iloprost administration, suggesting that such treatment might be useful in preventing vascular complications in patients with systemic sclerosis. Iloprost improves the portal hemodynamics, favoring local microvascular patency, and its effectiveness may be safely monitored by using portal color Doppler ultrasonography.},

This analysis used automated clinical data and the 2000 {US} Census. We estimated 2 measures of hypertension treatment adherence in 2003 using the supply of dispensed drugs in days (proportion of days covered {\textgreater} or = 80\%): (1) adherence to {\textgreater} or = 1 hypertension drug; and (2) adherence to the full hypertension treatment regimen. We defined the regimen by the number of hypertension drugs used concurrently in 2002. We assessed adherence annually and during the 30, 60, and 90 days before an {SBP} measurement. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between adherence and the number of drugs in the hypertension regimen, as well as the association between adherence and elevated {SBP} ( {\textgreater} or = 140 mm Hg). We adjusted for patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. {RESULTS}: The majority (52.8\%) of patients had multidrug hypertension regimens. In 2003, 87.3\% of subjects were adherent to {\textgreater} or = 1 hypertension drug; 72.1\% were adherent to their full regimen. After adjustment, we found that subjects with multidrug regimens were significantly more likely to be adherent to {\textgreater} or = 1 drug and significantly less likely to be adherent to their full regimen, compared with patients on a 1-drug regimen. Over one-third of subjects had elevated {SBP} in 2003. Both adherence measures were associated with lower odds of having elevated {SBP} (eg, odds ratio = 0.87 [95\% {CI}, 0.84-0.89] for adherence to the full regimen). For subjects with multidrug regimens, partial adherence and nonadherence to the regimen were associated with higher odds of having elevated {SBP}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Adherence measures using automated pharmacy data can identify patients who are nonadherent to their drug treatment regimen and who are more likely to have inadequately controlled {BP}. Adherence measures that account for the number of drugs in a patients' drug regimen might help identify additional patients at risk for poor {BP} outcomes due to partial treatment adherence.},

Using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey and Beck Depression Inventory-{II}, we examined {QoL} before and 3 months after renal denervation in patients with uncontrolled {BP}. For baseline comparisons, matched data were extracted from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle database. Before renal denervation, patients with resistant hypertension (n = 62) scored significantly worse in 5 of the eight 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey domains and the Mental Component Summary score. Three months after denervation (n = 40), clinic {BP} was reduced (change in systolic and diastolic {BP}, -16 +/- 4 and -6 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively; P{\textless}0.01). The Mental Component Summary score improved (47.6 +/- 1.1 versus 52 +/- 1; P = 0.001) as a result of increases in the vitality, social function, role emotion, and mental health domains. Beck Depression Inventory scores were also improved, particularly with regard to symptoms of sadness (P = 0.01), tiredness (P{\textless}0.001), and libido (P{\textless}0.01). The magnitude of {BP} reduction or {BP} level achieved at 3 months bore no association to the change in {QoL}. Renal denervation was without a detrimental effect on any elements of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. These results indicate that patients with severe hypertension resistant to therapy present with a marked reduction in subjective {QoL}.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretic agents are being increasingly used at lower doses. Hydrochlorothiazide ({HCTZ}) in the 12.5-mg dose remains the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive agent in the United States. {OBJECTIVES}: This study compared chlorthalidone, 6.25 mg daily, with {HCTZ}, 12.5 mg daily, by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure ({ABP}) monitoring and evaluated efficacy. Because {HCTZ} has been perceived as a short-acting drug, a third comparison with an extended-release formulation ({HCTZ}-controlled release [{CR}]) was added. {METHODS}: This 12-week comparative, double-blind, outpatient study randomized 54 patients with stage 1 hypertension to receive either chlorthalidone, 6.25 mg, (n = 16); {HCTZ} 12.5 mg (n = 18); or {HCTZ}-{CR} 12.5 mg (n = 20). {ABP} monitoring was performed at baseline and after 4 and 12 weeks of therapy. {RESULTS}: All 3 treatments significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) lowered office {BP} at weeks 4 and 12 from baseline. At weeks 4 and 12, significant reductions in systolic and diastolic 24-h ambulatory and nighttime {BP} (p {\textless} 0.01) were observed with chlorthalidone but not with {HCTZ}. At weeks 4 (p = 0.015) and 12 (p = 0.020), nighttime systolic {ABP} was significantly lower in the chlorthalidone group than in the the {HCTZ} group. With {HCTZ} therapy, sustained hypertension was converted into masked hypertension. In contrast to the {HCTZ} group, the {HCTZ}-{CR} group also showed a significant (p {\textless} 0.01) reduction in 24-h {ABP}. All 3 treatments were generally safe and well tolerated. {CONCLUSIONS}: Treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone, 6.25 mg daily, significantly reduced mean 24-h {ABP} as well as daytime and nighttime {BP}. Due to its short duration of action, no significant 24-h {ABP} reduction was seen with {HCTZ}, 12.5 mg daily, which merely converted sustained hypertension into masked hypertension. Thus, low-dose chlorthalidone, 6.25 mg, could be used as monotherapy for treatment of essential hypertension, whereas low-dose {HCTZ} monotherapy is not an appropriate antihypertensive drug.

The equations demonstrated the potential importance of controlling multiple risk factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy) as opposed to focusing on one single risk factor. The parametric model used was seen to have several advantages over existing standard regression models.

Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2012, a total of 9255 adult participants aged {\textgreater}/=18 years were identified as having hypertension, defined as measured blood pressure {\textgreater}/=140/90 mm Hg or taking prescription medication for hypertension. Awareness and treatment among hypertensive adults were ascertained via an interviewer administered questionnaire. Controlled hypertension among hypertensive adults was defined as systolic blood pressure {\textless}140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure {\textless}90 mm Hg. Blood pressure was categorized as optimal blood pressure, prehypertension, and stage I and stage {II} hypertension. Between 2003 and 2012, the percentage of adults with controlled hypertension increased (P-trend {\textless}0.01). Hypertensive adults with optimal blood pressure and with prehypertension increased from 13\% to 19\% and 27\% to 33\%, respectively (P-trend {\textless}0.01 for both groups). Among hypertensive adults who were taking antihypertensive medication, uncontrolled hypertension decreased from 38\% to 30\% (P-trend {\textless}0.01). Similarly, a decrease in mean systolic blood pressure was observed (P-trend {\textless}0.01); however, mean diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged. The trend in the control of blood pressure has improved among hypertensive adults resulting in a higher percentage with blood pressure at the optimal or prehypertension level and a lower percentage in stage I and stage {II} hypertension. Overall, mean systolic blood pressure decreased as did the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension among the treated hypertensive population.},

Generative and discriminative classification (naive Bayes, support vector machines, Gaussian mixture models, hidden Markov models) were used to integrate heterogeneous patient data and form a predictive tool for the inference of lactate level and mortality risk. {RESULTS}: An accuracy of 0.99 and discriminability of 1.00 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) for lactate level prediction was obtained when the vital signs and {WBC} measurements were analysed in a 24 h time bin. An accuracy of 0.73 and discriminability of 0.73 {AUC} for mortality prediction in patients with sepsis was achieved with only three features: median of lactate levels, mean arterial pressure, and median absolute deviation of the respiratory rate. {DISCUSSION}: This study introduces a new scheme for the prediction of lactate levels and mortality risk from patient vital signs and {WBC}. Accurate prediction of both these variables can drive the appropriate response by clinical staff and thus may have important implications for patient health and treatment outcome. {CONCLUSIONS}: Effective predictions of lactate levels and mortality risk can be provided with a few clinical variables when the temporal aspect and variability of patient data are considered.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To systematically review studies quantifying the associations of long term (clinic), mid-term (home), and short term (ambulatory) variability in blood pressure, independent of mean blood pressure, with cardiovascular disease events and mortality. {DATA} {SOURCES}: Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Web of Science, searched to 15 February 2016 for full text articles in English. {ELIGIBILITY} {CRITERIA} {FOR} {STUDY} {SELECTION}: Prospective cohort studies or clinical trials in adults, except those in patients receiving haemodialysis, where the condition may directly impact blood pressure variability. Standardised hazard ratios were extracted and, if there was little risk of confounding, combined using random effects meta-analysis in main analyses. Outcomes included all cause and cardiovascular disease mortality and cardiovascular disease events. Measures of variability included standard deviation, coefficient of variation, variation independent of mean, and average real variability, but not night dipping or day-night variation. {RESULTS}: 41 papers representing 19 observational cohort studies and 17 clinical trial cohorts, comprising 46 separate analyses were identified. Long term variability in blood pressure was studied in 24 papers, mid-term in four, and short-term in 15 (two studied both long term and short term variability). Results from 23 analyses were excluded from main analyses owing to high risks of confounding. Increased long term variability in systolic blood pressure was associated with risk of all cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.15, 95\% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.22), cardiovascular disease mortality (1.18, 1.09 to 1.28), cardiovascular disease events (1.18, 1.07 to 1.30), coronary heart disease (1.10, 1.04 to 1.16), and stroke (1.15, 1.04 to 1.27). Increased mid-term and short term variability in daytime systolic blood pressure were also associated with all cause mortality (1.15, 1.06 to 1.26 and 1.10, 1.04 to 1.16, respectively). {CONCLUSIONS}: Long term variability in blood pressure is associated with cardiovascular and mortality outcomes, over and above the effect of mean blood pressure. Associations are similar in magnitude to those of cholesterol measures with cardiovascular disease. Limited data for mid-term and short term variability showed similar associations. Future work should focus on the clinical implications of assessment of variability in blood pressure and avoid the common confounding pitfalls observed to date. {SYSTEMATIC} {REVIEW} {REGISTRATION}: {PROSPERO} {CRD}42014015695.},

	abstract = {Men are at greater risk for cardiovascular and renal disease than are age-matched, premenopausal women. Recent studies using the technique of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring have shown that blood pressure is higher in men than in women at similar ages. After menopause, however, blood pressure increases in women to levels even higher than in men. Hormone replacement therapy in most cases does not significantly reduce blood pressure in postmenopausal women, suggesting that the loss of estrogens may not be the only component involved in the higher blood pressure in women after menopause. In contrast, androgens may decrease only slightly, if at all, in postmenopausal women. In this review the possible mechanisms by which androgens may increase blood pressure are discussed. Findings in animal studies show that there is a blunting of the pressure-natriuresis relationship in male spontaneously hypertensive rats and in ovariectomized female spontaneously hypertensive rats treated chronically with testosterone. The key factor in controlling the pressure-natriuresis relationship is the renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}). The possibility that androgens increase blood pressure via the {RAS} is explored, and the possibility that the {RAS} also promotes oxidative stress leading to production of vasoconstrictor substances and reduction in nitric oxide availability is proposed.},

Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2003 through 2008, nonpregnant adults with hypertension were classified as resistant if their blood pressure was ≥140/90 mm Hg and they reported using antihypertensive medications from 3 different drug classes or drugs from ≥4 antihypertensive drug classes regardless of blood pressure. Among {US} adults with hypertension, 8.9\% ({SE}: 0.6\%) met criteria for resistant hypertension. This represented 12.8\% ({SE}: 0.9\%) of the antihypertensive drug-treated population. Of all drug-treated adults whose hypertension was uncontrolled, 72.4\% ({SE}: 1.6\%) were taking drugs from {\textless}3 classes. Compared with those with controlled hypertension using 1 to 3 medication classes, adults with resistant hypertension were more likely to be older, to be non-Hispanic black, and to have higher body mass index (all P{\textless}0.001). They were more likely to have albuminuria, reduced renal function, and self-reported medical histories of coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and diabetes mellitus (P{\textless}0.001). Most (85.6\% [{SE}: 2.4\%]) individuals with resistant hypertension used a diuretic. Of this group, 64.4\% ({SE}: 3.2\%) used the relatively weak thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. Although not rare, resistant hypertension is currently found in only a modest proportion of the hypertensive population. Among those classified here as resistant, inadequate diuretic therapy may be a modifiable therapeutic target.

We analyzed the data according to the sex-specific prevalence of disease and assessed changes in enrollment over time. We performed a similar analysis after excluding all single-sex trials. {RESULTS}: A total of 398,801 subjects (215,796 women and 183,005 men) were enrolled in {NHLBI}-funded studies of cardiovascular disease. The overall enrollment rate for women (54 percent) exceeded the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women in the general population (49 percent) and increased over time (P=0.002). With single-sex trials excluded, the enrollment rate for women was 38 percent, which did not change significantly over time. In studies of coronary artery disease and hypertension the rates of enrollment of women were similar to or exceeded the prevalence of these disorders in women. The enrollment rate increased significantly over time in studies of coronary artery disease (P{\textless}0.001) but not in studies of hypertension or arrhythmia. Women were under-enrolled in studies of heart failure, and the rate of enrollment did not change significantly over time. When single-sex trials were excluded from the analysis of enrollment rates according to the prevalence of disease, the results were similar. There was no change in enrollment rates overtime for any category of disease. {CONCLUSIONS}: Federal efforts to increase the representation of women in clinical trials have been moderately successful primarily because of the institution of a small number of large, single-sex trials involving coronary artery disease. There has been no change in the sex composition of cohorts in the majority of studies of cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {The financial burden for {EU} health systems associated with cardiovascular disease ({CV}) has been estimated to be nearly 110 billion in 2006, corresponding to 10 \% of total healthcare expenditure across {EU} or a mean 223 annual cost per capita. The main purpose of this study is to estimate the costs related to hypertension and the economic impact of increasing adherence to anti-hypertensive therapy in five European countries (Italy, Germany, France, Spain and England). A probabilistic prevalence-based decision tree model was developed to estimate the direct costs of {CV} related to hypertension ({CV} defined as: stroke, heart attack, heart failure) in five European countries. Our model considered adherence to hypertension treatment as a main driver of blood pressure ({BP}) control ({BP} {\textless} 140/90 {mmHg}). Relative risk of {CV}, based on controlled or uncontrolled {BP} group, was estimated from the Framingham Heart Study and national review data. Prevalence and cost data were estimated from national literature reviews. A national payer ({NP}) perspective for 10 years was considered. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed in order to evaluate uncertainty around the results (given as 95 \% confidence intervals). The model estimated a total of 8.6 million (1.4 in Italy, 3.3 in Germany, 1.2 in Spain, 1.8 in France and 0.9 in England) {CV} events related to hypertension over the 10-year time horizon. Increasing the adherence rate to anti-hypertensive therapy to 70 \% (baseline value is different for each country) would lead to 82,235 fewer {CV} events (24,058 in Italy, 7,870 in Germany, 18,870 in Spain, 24,855 in France and 6,553 in England). From the {NP} perspective, the direct cost associated with hypertension was estimated to be 51.3 billion (8.1 in Italy, 17.1 in Germany, 12.2 in Spain, 8.8 in France and 5.0 in England). Increasing adherence to anti-hypertensive therapy to 70 \% would save a total of 332 million ({CI} 95 \%: 319-346 million) from the {NPs} perspective.

In the absence of well-defined risk factors for this complication, guidelines for prescribing cannot be established. {AIM}: To examine whether a subgroup of patients is particularly susceptible to this complication. {DESIGN}: Retrospective case-control study. {METHODS}: We defined and recruited cases of symptomatic hyponatraemia that necessitated hospitalization from January 1996 to April 2002. Controls were selected from 8420 patients being prescribed thiazides and seen at the same institution during that period of time. {RESULTS}: There were 223 cases and 216 controls, with a median 115 days thiazide use. Cases were older than controls (76 +/- 9 vs. 66 +/- 13 years, p {\textless} 0.001) and lighter (52.3 +/- 10.3 vs. 63.4 +/- 3 kg, p {\textless} 0.001). By univariate analysis, serum potassium level, use of indapamide, elderly home institutionalization and physical immobility were risk factors for thiazide-induced hyponatraemia, but gender, duration of thiazide use, concomitant therapy with loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and renal function were not. By stepwise logistic regression analysis, patient age, body weight and serum potassium were the only independent predictive factors. Each 10-year increment of age was associated with a two-fold increase in risk (hazards ratio 2.14, 95\%{CI} 1.59-2.88). For a 5 kg increment in mass, there was a 27\% decrease in odds ratio (odds ratio 0.77, 95\%{CI} 0.68-0.87).

	abstract = {Thiazide diuretics are associated with an increased risk of hyponatremia. The aim of this study was to investigate possible predictors of thiazide-induced hyponatremia.A total of 48 patients admitted to the ward or to the emergency department due to severe thiazide-induced hyponatremia (Na {\textless} 125 mmol/L) were enrolled in our study as the case group. Another 211 hypertensive patients with normal sodium levels after treatment with thiazide diuretics were selected as the control group. Twelve tag single nucleotide polymorphism markers were selected from the Potassium Channel, Inwardly Rectifying Subfamily J, Member 1 ({KCNJ}1) gene: rs1231254, rs2238009, rs1148058, rs675482, rs673614, rs12795437, rs2855800, rs2509585, rs3016774, rs881333, rs4529890, and rs7116606. Clinical and genetic parameters between patients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia and the control group were compared. Logistic regression was used to analyze data.The patients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia were older (P {\textless} 0.001), predominantly female (P = 0.008), had a lower mean body mass index ({BMI}) (P {\textless} 0.001), and more commonly used angiotensin {II} receptor antagonist (P {\textless} 0.001) and spironolactone (P = 0.007) compared with the control groups. Analysis with multivariate logistic regression revealed that age (odds ratio [{OR}], 1.13; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.08–1.19, P {\textless} 0.001), female gender ({OR}, 4.49; 95\% {CI}, 1.54–13.11, P = 0.006), {BMI} ({OR}, 0.80; 95\% {CI}, 0.69–0.93, P = 0.003), and {KCNJ}1 rs2509585 C/T or T/T polymorphisms ({OR}, 5.75; 95\% {CI}, 1.25–26.45, P = 0.03) were independent predictors for thiazide-induced hyponatremia.Older female patients with lower {BMIs} and {KCNJ}1 rs2509585 C/T or T/T polymorphisms were more likely to develop thiazide-induced hyponatremia.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}/{HYPOTHESIS}: This meta-analysis aimed to compare the renal outcomes between {ACE} inhibitor ({ACEI})/angiotensin {II} receptor blocker ({ARB}) and other antihypertensive drugs or placebo in type 2 diabetes. {METHODS}: Publications were identified from Medline and Embase up to July 2011. Only randomised controlled trials comparing {ACEI}/{ARB} monotherapy with other active drugs or placebo were eligible. The outcome of end-stage renal disease, doubling of serum creatinine, microvascular complications, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria and albuminuria regression were extracted. Risk ratios were pooled using a random-effects model if heterogeneity was present; a fixed-effects model was used in the absence of heterogeneity. {RESULTS}: Of 673 studies identified, 28 were eligible (n = 13-4,912). In direct meta-analysis, {ACEI}/{ARB} had significantly lower risk of serum creatinine doubling (pooled {RR} = 0.66 [95\% {CI} 0.52, 0.83]), macroalbuminuria (pooled {RR} = 0.70 [95\% {CI} 0.50, 1.00]) and albuminuria regression (pooled {RR} 1.16 [95\% {CI} 1.00, 1.39]) than other antihypertensive drugs, mainly calcium channel blockers ({CCBs}). Although the risks of end-stage renal disease and microalbuminuria were lower in the {ACEI}/{ARB} group (pooled {RR} 0.82 [95\% {CI} 0.64, 1.05] and 0.84 [95\% {CI} 0.61, 1.15], respectively), the differences were not statistically significant. The {ACEI}/{ARB} benefit over placebo was significant for all outcomes except microalbuminuria. A network meta-analysis detected significant treatment effects across all outcomes for both active drugs and placebo comparisons. {CONCLUSIONS}/{INTERPRETATION}: Our review suggests a consistent reno-protective effect of {ACEI}/{ARB} over other antihypertensive drugs, mainly {CCBs}, and placebo in type 2 diabetes. The lack of any differences in {BP} decrease between {ACEI}/{ARB} and active comparators suggest this benefit is not due simply to the antihypertensive effect.},

However, the benefit of beta-blocker use in patients with coronary artery disease ({CAD}) but no history of {MI}, those with a remote history of {MI}, and those with only risk factors for {CAD} is unclear. {OBJECTIVE}: To assess the association of beta-blocker use with cardiovascular events in stable patients with a prior history of {MI}, in those with {CAD} but no history of {MI}, and in those with only risk factors for {CAD}. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PATIENTS}: Longitudinal, observational study of patients in the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health ({REACH}) registry who were divided into 3 cohorts: known prior {MI} (n = 14,043), known {CAD} without {MI} (n = 12,012), or those with {CAD} risk factors only (n = 18,653). Propensity score matching was used for the primary analyses. The last follow-up data collection was April 2009. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal {MI}, or nonfatal stroke. The secondary outcome was the primary outcome plus hospitalization for atherothrombotic events or a revascularization procedure. {RESULTS}: Among the 44,708 patients, 21,860 were included in the propensity score-matched analysis. With a median follow-up of 44 months (interquartile range, 35-45 months), event rates were not significantly different in patients with beta-blocker use compared with those without beta-blocker use for any of the outcomes tested, even in the prior {MI} cohort (489 [16.93\%] vs 532 [18.60\%], respectively; hazard ratio [{HR}], 0.90 [95\% {CI}, 0.79-1.03]; P = .14).

In the cohort with {CAD} risk factors only, the event rates were higher for the primary outcome with beta-blocker use (467 [14.22\%]) vs without beta-blocker use (403 [12.11\%]) ({HR}, 1.18 [95\% {CI}, 1.02-1.36]; P = .02), for the secondary outcome (870 [22.01\%] vs 797 [20.17\%]; {OR}, 1.12 [95\% {CI}, 1.00-1.24]; P = .04) but not for the tertiary outcomes of {MI} (89 [2.82\%] vs 68 [2.00\%]; {HR}, 1.36 [95\% {CI}, 0.97-1.90]; P = .08) and stroke (210 [6.55\%] vs 168 [5.12\%]; {HR}, 1.22 [95\% {CI}, 0.99-1.52]; P = .06). However, in those with recent {MI} ({\textless}/=1 year), beta-blocker use was associated with a lower incidence of the secondary outcome ({OR}, 0.77 [95\% {CI}, 0.64-0.92]). {CONCLUSION}: In this observational study of patients with either {CAD} risk factors only, known prior {MI}, or known {CAD} without {MI}, the use of beta-blockers was not associated with a lower risk of composite cardiovascular events.},

To meet these quality goals, delivery systems will need to develop and disseminate strategies to improve adherence. The design of adherence interventions has too often been guided by the mistaken assumptions that adherence is a single behavior that can be predicted from readily available patient characteristics and that individual clinicians alone can improve adherence at the population level.Effective interventions require recognition that adherence is a set of interacting behaviors influenced by individual, social, and environmental forces; adherence interventions must be broadly based, rather than targeted to specific population subgroups; and counseling with a trusted clinician needs to be complemented by outreach interventions and removal of structural and organizational barriers. To achieve the adherence goals set by {CMS}, front-line clinicians, interdisciplinary teams, organizational leaders, and policymakers will need to coordinate efforts in ways that exemplify the underlying principles of health care reform.},

The evidence that this is associated with cardiovascular ({CV}) benefits compared with initial monotherapy is limited, however. The objective of this study was to assess whether, compared with antihypertensive monotherapy, a combination of antihypertensive drugs provides a greater {CV} protection in daily clinical practice. A population-based, nested case-control study was carried out by including the cohort of 209 650 patients from Lombardy (Italy) aged 40 to 79 years who were newly treated with antihypertensive drugs between 2000 and 2001. Cases were the 10 688 patients who experienced a hospitalization for {CV} disease from initial prescription until 2007. Three controls were randomly selected for each case. Logistic regression was used to model the {CV} risk associated with starting on and/or continuing with combination therapy. A Monte-Carlo sensitivity analysis was performed to account for unmeasured confounders. Patients starting on combination therapy had an 11\% {CV} risk reduction with respect to those starting on monotherapy (95\% {CI}: 5\% to 16\%). Compared with patients who maintained monotherapy also during follow-up, those who started on combination therapy and kept it along the entire period of observation had 26\% reduction of {CV} risk (95\% {CI}: 15\% to 35\%). In daily life practice, a combination of antihypertensive drugs is associated with a great reduction of {CV} risk. The indication for using combination of blood pressure drugs should be broadened.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Polypharmacy and medication adherence are well known challenges facing older adults. Medication regimen complexity increases the demands of self-care in the home. Some medication regimens may be more complex than others, especially when dosage form, frequency of dosing, and additional usage directions are included in complexity along with the number of medications In older adults with depression, it is unknown what features of their medications most influence their medication regimen complexity. {METHODS}: A sample cohort of 100 adults {\textgreater}/=65 years old with a diagnosis of depression was randomly selected from electronic medical records ({EMR}) in ambulatory clinics at the University of Colorado ({CU}) and University of San Diego ({SD}). Demographic, medical history, and medication-related information was extracted from the {EMR}. Complexity was determined using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index ({MRCI}). {IRB} approval was obtained. {FINDINGS}: The cohort mean age was 74.3 years ({SD}) and 79.7 years ({CU}). The mean unweighted Charlson comorbidity index for 1.0 ({SD}) and 1.8 ({CU}). The mean number of medications was 7.1 and 8.0, with 1.1 and 1.2 depression meds, 5.4 and 4.3 non-depression prescription meds, and 0.6 and 2.4 {OTC} meds for the {SD} and {CU} cohorts, respectively. 66\% of {SD} adults and 70\% of {CU} adults took six or more meds. Individual {MRCI} scores were on average 17.62 ({SD}) and 19.36 ({CU}). Dosing frequency contributed to 57-58\% of the {MRCI} score, with patients facing an average of 7-8 unique dosing frequencies in their regimen. In both cohorts, there was an average of 3 additional directions added to the regimens to clarify dosing. {IMPLICATIONS}: As expected, in our older adult cohorts with depression the majority of patients took multiple medications. Using a standardized instrument, we characterized the regimen complexity and found that it was increasingly complex due to numerous dosing forms, frequencies and additional directions for use. Patient-level medication regimen complexity should go beyond depression medication to encompass the patient's entire regimen for opportunities to reduce complexity and improve ease of self-care.},

Six family members were also interviewed. Analysis was by a constant comparative method. {RESULTS}: Patients were confident about self-monitoring and many felt their multiple home readings were more valid than single office readings taken by their {GP}. Although many patients self-titrated medication when required, others lacked the confidence to increase medication without reconsulting with their {GP}. Patients were more comfortable with titrating medication if their blood pressure readings were substantially above target, but were reluctant to implement such a change if readings were borderline. Many planned to continue self-monitoring after the study finished and report home readings to their {GP}, but few wished to continue with a self-management plan. {CONCLUSION}: Participants valued the additional information and many felt confident in both self-monitoring blood pressure and self-titrating medication. The reluctance to change medication for borderline readings suggests behaviour similar to the clinical inertia seen for physicians in analogous circumstances. Additional support for those lacking in confidence to implement prearranged medication changes may allow more patients to undertake self-management.},

Compared with those without, subjects with asthma were significantly less likely to be employed (odds ratio, 0.78), spent 1.4 more days sick in bed annually, and were significantly more likely to have activity limitations or to be unable to work. Adults with asthma incurred an additional \$1,907 (2008 {US} dollars) annually and experienced higher health care use and comorbidity. The total national medical expenditure attributable to adult asthma was \$18 billion. Adults with asthma were more likely to be covered by Medicaid (30\%) than the general adult population (10\%). The largest contributors to medical expenditures for adults with asthma were prescription drugs, followed by inpatient hospitalizations and home health care. {CONCLUSIONS}: In recent national data adult asthma is associated with a significant deleterious effect on direct and indirect costs in the {US}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: New trial evidence suggests that many patients may require more aggressive pharmacologic management to achieve lower blood pressure goals. Especially when first initiating anti-hypertensive treatment, it is unknown whether starting patients on multiple medications may be better for long-term adherence and persistence compared with starting one medication. {OBJECTIVE}: To examine contemporary patterns of anti-hypertensive therapy initiation and compare long-term adherence and persistence among patients initiating fixed-dose combinations and single anti-hypertensive therapies. {DESIGN}: Retrospective cohort study. {PATIENTS}: Using claims from a large nationwide insurer, we identified all patients initiating oral hypertension treatment from 2009 to 2013. We categorized patients into three categories based on the number and type of anti-hypertensive medications they initiated: a fixed-dose combination, a multi-pill combination or a single therapy. {MAIN} {MEASURES}: The primary outcome was persistence to any anti-hypertensive medication, either the initiated medication or other anti-hypertensive, 12 months after initiation in administrative claims. We also measured adherence to at least one anti-hypertensive in the 12 months after initiation and refilling at least one anti-hypertensive medication as outcomes. Full adherence was defined as having {\textgreater}/=80\% of potential days covered with medication. Multivariable modified Poisson regression models were used to examine the association between initiating a fixed-dose combination anti-hypertensive and medication outcomes. {KEY} {RESULTS}: Of the 484,493 patients who initiated oral anti-hypertensives, 78,958 patients initiated fixed-dose combinations, 383,269 initiated a single therapy, and 22,266 initiated multi-pill combinations. Patients initiating fixed-dose combinations were 9\% more likely to be persistent (relative risk [{RR}]: 1.09, 95\% {CI}: 1.08-1.10) and 13\% more likely to be adherent ({RR}: 1.13 95\% {CI}: 1.11-1.14) than those who started on a single anti-hypertensive therapy. Refill rates were also slightly higher among fixed-dose combination initiators. {CONCLUSIONS}: Fixed-dose combination pills appear to enhance adherence and persistence to anti-hypertensive medications among commercially insured patients starting treatment compared with single therapy.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents to lower blood pressure in adults with diabetes and kidney disease remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the benefits and harms of blood pressure-lowering drugs in this population of patients. {METHODS}: We did a network meta-analysis of randomised trials from around the world comparing blood pressure-lowering agents in adults with diabetic kidney disease. Electronic databases (the Cochrane Collaboration, Medline, and Embase) were searched systematically up to January, 2014, for trials in adults with diabetes and kidney disease comparing orally administered blood pressure-lowering drugs. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and end-stage kidney disease. We also assessed secondary safety and cardiovascular outcomes. We did random-effects network meta-analysis to obtain estimates for primary and secondary outcomes and we presented these estimates as odds ratios or standardised mean differences with 95\% {CIs}. We ranked the comparative effects of all drugs against placebo with surface under the cumulative ranking ({SUCRA}) probabilities. {FINDINGS}: 157 studies comprising 43,256 participants, mostly with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, were included in the network meta-analysis. No drug regimen was more effective than placebo for reducing all-cause mortality. However, compared with placebo, end-stage renal disease was significantly less likely after dual treatment with an angiotensin-receptor blocker ({ARB}) and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitor (odds ratio 0.62, 95\% {CI} 0.43-0.90) and after {ARB} monotherapy (0.77, 0.65-0.92). No regimen significantly increased hyperkalaemia or acute kidney injury, although combined {ACE} inhibitor and {ARB} treatment had the lowest rank among all interventions because of borderline increases in estimated risks of these harms (odds ratio 2.69, 95\% {CI} 0.97-7.47 for hyperkalaemia; 2.69, 0.98-7.38 for acute kidney injury). {INTERPRETATION}: No blood pressure-lowering strategy prolonged survival in adults with diabetes and kidney disease. {ACE} inhibitors and {ARBs}, alone or in combination, were the most effective strategies against end-stage kidney disease. Any benefits of combined {ACE} inhibitor and {ARB} treatment need to be balanced against potential harms of hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury. {FUNDING}: Canterbury Medical Research Foundation, Italian Medicines Agency.},

	abstract = {Diuretics are recommended as first-line antihypertensive treatment in elderly patients. Although attention is usually paid to prevent hypokalaemia with diuretic therapy, risk of hyponatraemia is often ignored. We performed this study to characterise hypertensive patients at increased risk to develop hyponatraemia. We reviewed charts of hypertensive patients hospitalised in Chaim Sheba Medical Center for hyponatraemia from 1990 to 1997. Patients with other causes of hyponatraemia were excluded. The General Practice Maccabi database was used to estimate age and sex distribution of patients prescribed diuretics for hypertension. We identified 180 hypertensive patients (149 F, 31 M; mean age 76.4 +/- 9.2 years) hospitalised because of hyponatraemia. Across all age groups, odds ratio ({OR}) to develop hyponatraemia was three times higher for women vs men ({OR} 3.10, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 2.07-4.67). One hundred and sixty-two patients (90\%) were older than 65 years. Patients of both sexes older than 65 years were 10 times (and if they were older than 75 years 16 times) more likely to develop hyponatraemia than those younger than 65 years ({OR} 9.87, 95\%, {CI}: 5.93-16.64). Most patients (74.5\%) used a thiazide-based diuretic; only 10\% used a low dose ({\textless}25 mg/day). In 37\% of patients diuretics were used for more than 1 year before hyponatraemia developed. Diuretic-induced hyponatraemia may be insidious and appear even after prolonged diuretics use. Elderly women seem to be at particularly high risk. In this population diuretic use should be associated with close monitoring of sodium and potassium levels.},

Four hundred and seventy-seven {ECG} biomarkers, encompassing global and individual {ECG} findings, were measured with computer algorithms. During a median follow-up of 8.1 years (range for survivors, 0.5 to 11.2 years), 1229 women died. For analyses, the cohort was randomly split into derivation (n=22 096; deaths, 819) and validation (n=11 048; deaths, 410) subsets. {ECG} biomarkers and demographic and clinical characteristics were simultaneously analyzed using both traditional Cox regression and random survival forest, a novel algorithmic machine-learning approach.

Random survival forest variable selection yielded 20 variables that were independently predictive of long-term mortality, 14 of which were {ECG} biomarkers related to autonomic tone, atrial conduction, and ventricular depolarization and repolarization. {CONCLUSIONS}- We identified 14 {ECG} biomarkers from among hundreds that were associated with long-term prognosis using a novel random forest variable selection methodology. These biomarkers were related to autonomic tone, atrial conduction, ventricular depolarization, and ventricular repolarization.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Bacteremia is relatively common in patients with skin and skin-structure infection ({SSSI}) severe enough to require hospitalization. We used selected demographic and clinical characteristics easily assessable at initial evaluation to develop a model for the early identification of patients with {SSSI} who are at higher risk for bacteremia. {PARTICIPANTS}: A large database of adults hospitalized with {SSSI} at 97 hospitals in the United States during the period from 2003 through 2007 and from whom blood samples were obtained for culture at admission. {METHODS}: We compared selected candidate predictor variables for patients shown to have bacteremia and patients with no demonstrated bacteremia. Using stepwise logistic regression to identify independent risk factors for bacteremia, we derived a model by using 75\% of a randomly split cohort, converted the model coefficients into a risk score system, and then we validated it by using the remaining 25\% of the cohort. {RESULTS}: Bacteremia was documented in 1,021 (11.7\%) of the 8,747 eligible patients. Independent predictors of bacteremia (P{\textless}.001) were infected device or prosthesis, respiratory rate less than 10 or more than 29 breaths per minute, pulse rate less than 49 or more than 125 beats per minute, temperature less than 35.6 degrees C or at least 38.0 degrees C, white blood cell band percentage of 7\% or more, white blood cell count greater than 11x10(9)/L, healthcare-associated infection, male sex, and older age. The bacteremia rates ranged from 3.7\% (lowest decile) to 30.6\% (highest decile) (P{\textless}.001). The model C statistic was 0.71; the Hosmer-Lemeshow test P value was .36, indicating excellent model calibration. {CONCLUSIONS}: Using data available at hospital admission, we developed a risk score that differentiated {SSSI} patients at low risk for bacteremia from patients at high risk. This score may help clinicians identify patients who require more intensive monitoring or antimicrobial regimens appropriate for treating bacteremia.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Stroke is a major cause of long-term disability in the United States. This study examined the national impact of stroke on health-related quality of life ({HRQoL}) and disparities in {HRQoL} across different demographic groups. {METHODS}: Combined 2000 and 2002 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data were used, which include quality-of-life measures based on the short-form generic measures ({SF}-12) and the {EuroQol} Group measures ({EQ}-5D index and {EQ} {VAS}) for 39,680 adults aged {\textgreater}18 years. Stratified analysis and ordinary least square regressions were used to compare {HRQoL} scores between stroke and nonstroke populations. {RESULTS}: The study included 1040 noninstitutionalized stroke survivors. After adjustment for sociodemographics, risk factors, and comorbidities, stroke survivors had statistically significantly lower mean scores for mental health (-4.1\%), physical health (-7.9\%), health utility (-6.9\%), and self-rated health (-7.2\%) (all P{\textless}0.01). In general, stroke did not affect differences in {HRQoL} among age or gender groups. However, racial and ethnic disparities in {HRQoL} were greater among stroke survivors than nonstroke individuals, particularly in health utility scores for black vs white participants (-0.06 in stroke survivors and -0.02 in the nonstroke population, P{\textless}0.01) and Hispanic versus non-Hispanic participants (-0.11 in stroke survivors and -0.01 in the nonstroke population). {CONCLUSIONS}: Stroke significantly impairs {HRQoL} in the United States. The findings suggest that racial and ethnic disparities in {HRQoL} among stroke survivors are more pronounced than in the nonstroke population. The burden of nonfatal stroke, especially among racial and ethnic minorities, should be recognized more widely.},

An association between identified clusters and clinical outcomes was assessed using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Differential associations between clinical outcomes and exercise testing were examined using interaction testing. {RESULTS}: Four clusters were identified (ranging from 248 to 773 patients in each), in which patients varied considerably among measures of age, sex, race, symptoms, comorbidities, {HF} etiology, socioeconomic status, quality of life, cardiopulmonary exercise testing parameters, and biomarker levels. Differential associations were observed for hospitalization and mortality risks between and within clusters. Compared with cluster 1, risk of all-cause mortality and/or all-cause hospitalization ranged from 0.65 (95\% confidence interval [95\% {CI}]: 0.54 to 0.78) for cluster 4 to 1.02 (95\% {CI}: 0.87 to 1.19) for cluster 3. However, for all-cause mortality, cluster 3 had a disproportionately lower risk of 0.61 (95\% {CI}: 0.44 to 0.86). Evidence suggested differential effects of exercise treatment on changes in peak oxygen consumption and clinical outcomes between clusters (p for interaction {\textless}0.04). {CONCLUSIONS}: Cluster analysis of clinical variables identified 4 distinct phenotypes of chronic {HF}.

	abstract = {Arthritis and hypertension are frequent comorbidities in the elderly hypertensive population. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to relieve pain in arthritic patients but a side effect is sodium retention and consequent elevation of blood pressure ({BP}). The effect of dihydropyridine calcium blocking drugs is relatively independent of sodium intake, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors' effects can be blunted by a high-sodium diet. This study compared the effects of indomethacin with placebo in elderly patients with essential hypertension who had been controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. Indomethacin 50 mg twice daily or placebo was administered for 3 weeks in a double-blind crossover study to patients controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. The response was assessed by ambulatory {BP} measurement. Indomethacin raised {BP} and lowered pulse rates in patients taking enalapril but had little effect in patients receiving amlodipine. The difference caused by indomethacin between the two groups was 10.1/4.9 mm Hg increase in {BP} and a 5.6 beats/min fall in pulse in people taking enalapril. Addition of indomethacin to patients taking either drug caused a rise in weight and a fall in plasma renin. It is postulated that the effect is due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which causes sodium retention. In patients taking amlodipine, the fall in plasma renin ameliorates the effect of sodium retention on {BP}. In patients taking enalapril, plasma renin falls but this is not translated into an effect because of the blockage of converting enzyme. Thus, the full effect of sodium retention on {BP} is expressed. In patients treated with indomethacin, fewer patients may respond to {ACE} inhibitors. However, the major problem is the patient who intermittently takes indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which, if a person is treated by an {ACE} inhibitor causes {BP} to go out of control. In such patients amlodipine would appear to be a preferred choice to enalapril.},

An automated clinical prediction model for out of intensive care unit ({ICU}) cardiopulmonary arrest and unexpected death was created in the derivation sample (50\% randomly selected from total cohort) using multivariable logistic regression. The automated model was then validated in the remaining 50\% from the total cohort (validation sample). The primary outcome was a composite of resuscitation events, and death ({RED}). {RED} included cardiopulmonary arrest, acute respiratory compromise and unexpected death. Predictors were measured using data from the previous 24 hours. Candidate variables included vital signs, laboratory data, physician orders, medications, floor assignment, and the Modified Early Warning Score ({MEWS}), among other treatment variables. {RESULTS}: {RED} rates were 1.2\% of patient-days for the total cohort. Fourteen variables were independent predictors of {RED} and included age, oxygenation, diastolic blood pressure, arterial blood gas and laboratory values, emergent orders, and assignment to a high risk floor. The automated model had excellent discrimination (c-statistic=0.85) and calibration and was more sensitive (51.6\% and 42.2\%) and specific (94.3\% and 91.3\%) than the {MEWS} alone. The automated model predicted {RED} 15.9 hours before they occurred and earlier than Rapid Response Team ({RRT}) activation (5.7 hours prior to an event, p=0.003) {CONCLUSION}: An automated model harnessing {EMR} data offers great potential for identifying {RED} and was superior to both a prior risk model and the human judgment-driven {RRT}.},

Drug Interaction Probability Scale ({DIPS}) was used to assess the causality of association between {ACEI}-drug interactions and the adverse outcome (hyperkalemia). {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURE}: Hyperkalemia as an adverse clinical outcome of the interaction was identified from laboratory investigations. {RESULTS}: Of the 489 patients included in the analysis, 48 (9.8\%) had hyperkalemia thought to be associated with {ACEI}-drug interactions. Univariate analysis using binary logistic regression revealed that advanced age (60 years or more), and taking more than 15 medications were independent risk factors significantly associated with hyperkalemia. However, current and previous smoking history appeared to be a protective factor. Risk factors identified as predictors of hyperkalemia secondary to {ACEI}-drug interactions by multi-logistic regression were: advanced age (adjusted {OR} 2.3, {CI} 1.07-5.01); renal disease (adjusted {OR} 4.7, {CI} 2.37-9.39); hepatic disease (adjusted {OR} 5.2, {CI} 1.08-25.03); taking 15-20 medications (adjusted {OR} 4.4, {CI} 2.08-9.19); and taking 21-26 medications (adjusted {OR} 9.0, {CI} 1.64-49.74). {CONCLUSION}: Cardiac patients receiving {ACEIs} concomitantly with potentially interacting drugs are at high risk of experiencing hyperkalemia. Old age, renal disease, hepatic disease, and receiving large number of medications are factors that may significantly increase their vulnerability towards this adverse outcome; thus, frequent monitoring is advocated.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Therapeutic inertia has been defined as the failure of health-care provider to initiate or intensify therapy when therapeutic goals are not reached. It is regarded as a major cause of uncontrolled hypertension. The exploration of its causes and the interventions to reduce it are plagued by unclear conceptualizations and hypothesized mechanisms. We therefore systematically searched the literature for definitions and discussions on the concept of therapeutic inertia in hypertension in primary care, to try and form an operational definition. {METHODS}: A systematic review of all types of publications related to clinical inertia in hypertension was performed. Medline, {EMbase}, {PsycInfo}, the Cochrane library and databases, {BDSP}, {CRD} and {NGC} were searched from the start of their databases to June 2013. Articles were selected independently by two authors on the basis of their conceptual content, without other eligibility criteria or formal quality appraisal. Qualitative data were extracted independently by two teams of authors. Data were analyzed using a constant comparative qualitative method. {RESULTS}: The final selection included 89 articles. 112 codes were grouped in 4 categories: terms and definitions (semantics), "who" (physician, patient or system), "how and why" (mechanisms and reasons), and "appropriateness". Regarding each of these categories, a number of contradictory assertions were found, most of them relying on little or no empirical data. Overall, the limits of what should be considered as inertia were not clear. A number of authors insisted that what was considered deleterious inertia might in fact be appropriate care, depending on the situation. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our data analysis revealed a major lack of conceptualization of therapeutic inertia in hypertension and important discrepancies regarding its possible causes, mechanisms and outcomes. The concept should be split in two parts: appropriate inaction and inappropriate inertia. The development of consensual and operational definitions relying on empirical data and the exploration of the intimate mechanisms that underlie these behaviors are now needed.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To analyse and compare with one another and with other antibacterial drugs the adverse drug reactions ({ADRs}) of the different fluoroquinolones currently used in Italy, spontaneously reported from doctors in three northern Italian regions. {METHODS}: The data on fluoroquinolones and other antibacterials were obtained from the spontaneous reporting system database of Emilia Romagna, Lombardy and the Veneto, which are the principal contributors to the Italian spontaneous surveillance system. The fluoroquinolone {ADRs} with a causality assessment of certain, probable or possible (according to {WHO} criteria), reported between January 1999 and December 2001, were selected and toxicity profiles of individual drugs were described and compared with one another. The reports were also correlated with sex and age of patients and with regional prescription data to estimate individual fluoroquinolone reporting rate of adverse events. {RESULTS}: During the study period, 10 011 reports were received by the system (a mean annual reporting rate of approximately 185 per million inhabitants): 1920 referred to systemic antimicrobials, of which 432 (22.5\%) involved fluoroquinolones. Pefloxacin was associated with the highest reporting rate (982 reports/daily defined dose/1000 inhabitants/day), followed by moxifloxacin (356), rufloxacin (221) and lomefloxacin (196). The most frequently reported reactions to fluoroquinolones involved the skin, but their percentage (25\%) was significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.01) than those of other systemic antimicrobials (58.5\%), whereas the percentages of reactions involving the central nervous (12.2 vs 3.6\%), musculoskeletal (14.7 vs 0.3\%) and psychiatric systems (9.3 vs 1.8\%) were significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.01). We found some significant differences in the safety profiles of individual fluoroquinolones: ciprofloxacin was more frequently associated with skin reactions (p {\textless} 0.01), levofloxacin and pefloxacin with musculoskeletal (p {\textless} 0.01), and rufloxacin with psychiatric disorders (p {\textless} 0.05). Levofloxacin was the fluoroquinolone associated with the highest rate of serious tendon disorders; phototoxic reactions were more frequent with lomefloxacin, and toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome were seen only with ciprofloxacin. {CONCLUSIONS}: The differences in the safety profiles should be taken into account when prescribing a fluoroquinolone to individual patients.},

We expressed study results as risk ratios ({RR}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) and combined them using the fixed-effects or random-effects method, as appropriate. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: We included 13 {RCTs} which compared beta-blockers to placebo (4 trials, N=23,613), diuretics (5 trials, N=18,241), calcium-channel blockers ({CCBs}: 4 trials, N=44,825), and renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}) inhibitors (3 trials, N=10,828). Three-quarters of the 40,245 participants on beta-blockers used atenolol. Most studies had a high risk of bias; resulting from various limitations in study design, conduct, and data analysis.Total mortality was not significantly different between beta-blockers and placebo ({RR} 0.99, 95\%{CI} 0.88 to 1.11; I(2)=0\%), diuretics or {RAS} inhibitors, but was higher for beta-blockers compared to {CCBs} ({RR} 1.07, 95\%{CI} 1.00 to 1.14; I(2)=2\%). Total cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) was lower for beta-blockers compared to placebo ({RR} 0.88, 95\%{CI} 0.79 to 0.97; I(2)=21\%). This is primarily a reflection of the significant decrease in stroke ({RR} 0.80, 95\%{CI} 0.66 to 0.96; I(2)=0\%), since there was no significant difference in coronary heart disease ({CHD}) between beta-blockers and placebo. There was no significant difference in withdrawals from assigned treatment due to adverse events between beta-blockers and placebo ({RR} 1.12, 95\%{CI} 0.82 to 1.54; I(2)=66\%).The effect of beta-blockers on {CVD} was significantly worse than that of {CCBs} ({RR} 1.18, 95\%{CI} 1.08-1.29; I(2)=0\%), but was not different from that of diuretics or {RAS} inhibitors. In addition, there was an increase in stroke in beta-blockers compared to {CCBs} ({RR} 1.24, 95\%{CI} 1.11-1.40; I(2)=0\%) and {RAS} inhibitors ({RR} 1.30, 95\%{CI} 1.11 to 1.53; I(2)=29\%). However, {CHD} was not significantly different between beta-blockers and diuretics, {CCBs} or {RAS} inhibitors. Participants on beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events than those on {RAS} inhibitors ({RR} 1.41, 95\% {CI} 1.29 to 1.54; I(2)=12\%), but there was no significant difference with diuretics or {CCBs}. {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Initiating treatment of hypertension with beta-blockers leads to modest reductions in cardiovascular disease and no significant effects on mortality. These effects of beta-blockers are inferior to those of other antihypertensive drugs. The {GRADE} quality of this evidence is low, implying that the true effect of beta-blockers may be substantially different from the estimate of effects found in this review. Further research should be of high quality and should explore whether there are differences between different sub-types of beta-blockers or whether beta-blockers have differential effects on younger and elderly patients.},

	abstract = {National guidelines and a recent clinical trial have supported the use of thiazide diuretics as the preferred initial pharmacological treatment for hypertension. However, evidence from this and other clinical trials have also found an increased incidence of new onset diabetes among those patients receiving thiazide diuretics. The mechanisms responsible for the increased incidence of diabetes with thiazide diuretics have not been fully elucidated. This article provides a review of intervention studies that included data on the relation between thiazide-induced hypokalemia and glucose intolerance. We conducted a literature search from 1966 to June 2004 to identify clinical trials using thiazide diuretics where the metabolic effects on potassium and glucose are reported. A total of 59 clinical trials constituting 83 thiazide diuretic study arms were identified. Trial size, length, type of thiazide diuretic, and dose varied substantially among the studies. The association between average changes in potassium and glucose in the study arms is considered jointly in a weighted statistical model. The Pearson's correlation coefficient, weighted by study sample size, for the relationship between glucose and potassium was -0.54 (95\% {CI}, -0.67 to -0.36; P {\textless} 0.01). A sensitivity analysis, which considered subset analyses and effect of covariates, as well as inverse-variance weighting, supported this finding. These data suggest that thiazide-induced hypokalemia is associated with increased blood glucose. Treatment of thiazide-induced hypokalemia may reverse glucose intolerance and possibly prevent the future development of diabetes.},

	abstract = {The aims of this article are to review the current understanding of hyperkalemia associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ({ACEi}) or angiotensin receptor blocker ({ARB}) therapy. This includes reviewing the pathophysiology of how these agents affect potassium handling within the kidney, risk factors for developing hyperkalemia, incidence, clinical signs and symptoms, and providing a practical approach to treatment of the patient who is either at risk of, or experiencing, hyperkalemia. {ACEi} and {ARB} are effective therapeutic agents used in a variety of clinical scenarios. However, related to their effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, their use can be associated with hyperkalemia, particularly in patients who have chronic renal insufficiency. Published incidence estimates of hyperkalemia associated with {ACEi} or {ARB} vary, but up to 10\% of patients may experience at least mild hyperkalemia. Important considerations when initiating {ACEi} or {ARB} therapy include obtaining an estimate of glomerular filtration rate and a baseline serum potassium concentration, as well as assessing whether the patient has excessive potassium intake from diet, supplements, or drugs that can also increase serum potassium. Serum potassium monitoring shortly after initiation of therapy can assist in preventing hyperkalemia. If hyperkalemia does develop, prompt recognition of cardiac dysrhythmias and effective treatment to antagonize the cardiac effects of potassium, redistribute potassium into cells, and remove excess potassium from the body is important.Understanding the mechanism of action of {ACEi} and {ARB} coupled with judicious drug use and clinical vigilance can minimize the risk to the patient of developing hyperkalemia. Should hyperkalemia occur, prompt recognition and management can optimize clinical outcome.},

	abstract = {Patients with essential hypertension have disturbed autonomic cardiovascular regulation and circadian pacemaker function. Recently, the biological clock was shown to be involved in autonomic cardiovascular regulation. Our objective was to determine whether enhancement of the functioning of the biological clock by repeated nighttime melatonin intake might reduce ambulatory blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 16 men with untreated essential hypertension to investigate the influence of acute (single) and repeated (daily for 3 weeks) oral melatonin (2.5 mg) intake 1 hour before sleep on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and actigraphic estimates of sleep quality. Repeated melatonin intake reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure during sleep by 6 and 4 mm Hg, respectively. The treatment did not affect heart rate. The day-night amplitudes of the rhythms in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were increased by 15\% and 25\%, respectively. A single dose of melatonin had no effect on blood pressure. Repeated (but not acute) melatonin also improved sleep. Improvements in blood pressure and sleep were statistically unrelated. In patients with essential hypertension, repeated bedtime melatonin intake significantly reduced nocturnal blood pressure. Future studies in larger patient group should be performed to define the characteristics of the patients who would benefit most from melatonin intake. The present study suggests that support of circadian pacemaker function may provide a new strategy in the treatment of essential hypertension.},

Challenges in summarizing and representing patient data prevent widespread practice of predictive modeling using {EHRs}. Here we present a novel unsupervised deep feature learning method to derive a general-purpose patient representation from {EHR} data that facilitates clinical predictive modeling. In particular, a three-layer stack of denoising autoencoders was used to capture hierarchical regularities and dependencies in the aggregated {EHRs} of about 700,000 patients from the Mount Sinai data warehouse. The result is a representation we name "deep patient". We evaluated this representation as broadly predictive of health states by assessing the probability of patients to develop various diseases. We performed evaluation using 76,214 test patients comprising 78 diseases from diverse clinical domains and temporal windows. Our results significantly outperformed those achieved using representations based on raw {EHR} data and alternative feature learning strategies. Prediction performance for severe diabetes, schizophrenia, and various cancers were among the top performing. These findings indicate that deep learning applied to {EHRs} can derive patient representations that offer improved clinical predictions, and could provide a machine learning framework for augmenting clinical decision systems.},

Yet, audit and feedback has not consistently been found to be effective.{\textbar}To assess the effects of audit and feedback on the practice of healthcare professionals and patient outcomes.{\textbar}We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group's register and pending file up to January 2004.{\textbar}Randomised trials of audit and feedback (defined as any summary of clinical performance over a specified period of time) that reported objectively measured professional practice in a healthcare setting or healthcare outcomes.{\textbar}Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Quantitative (meta-regression), visual and qualitative analyses were undertaken. For each comparison we calculated the risk difference ({RD}) and risk ratio ({RR}), adjusted for baseline compliance when possible, for dichotomous outcomes and the percentage and the percent change relative to the control group average after the intervention, adjusted for baseline performance when possible, for continuous outcomes. We investigated the following factors as possible explanations for the variation in the effectiveness of interventions across comparisons: the type of intervention (audit and feedback alone, audit and feedback with educational meetings, or multifaceted interventions that included audit and feedback), the intensity of the audit and feedback, the complexity of the targeted behaviour, the seriousness of the outcome, baseline compliance and study quality.{\textbar}Thirty new studies were added to this update, and a total of 118 studies are included. In the primary analysis 88 comparisons from 72 studies were included that compared any intervention in which audit and feedback is a component compared to no intervention. For dichotomous outcomes the adjusted risk difference of compliance with desired practice varied from - 0.16 (a 16 \% absolute decrease in compliance) to 0.70 (a 70\% increase in compliance) (median = 0.05, inter-quartile range = 0.03 to 0.11) and the adjusted risk ratio varied from 0.71 to 18.3 (median = 1.08, inter-quartile range = 0.99 to 1.30).

Objective: To estimate age-standardized mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases by county. Design and Setting: Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics and population counts from the {US} Census Bureau, the National Center for Health Statistics, and the Human Mortality Database from 1980 through 2014 were used. Validated small area estimation models were used to estimate county-level mortality rates from all cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation and flutter, rheumatic heart disease, aortic aneurysm, peripheral arterial disease, endocarditis, and all other cardiovascular diseases combined. Exposures: The 3110 counties of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates by county, year, sex, and cause. Results: From 1980 to 2014, cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death in the United States, although the mortality rate declined from 507.4 deaths per 100000 persons in 1980 to 252.7 deaths per 100000 persons in 2014, a relative decline of 50.2\% (95\% uncertainty interval [{UI}], 49.5\%-50.8\%). In 2014, cardiovascular diseases accounted for more than 846000 deaths (95\% {UI}, 827-865 thousand deaths) and 11.7 million years of life lost (95\% {UI}, 11.6-11.9 million years of life lost). The gap in age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates between counties at the 10th and 90th percentile declined 14.6\% from 172.1 deaths per 100000 persons in 1980 to 147.0 deaths per 100000 persons in 2014 (posterior probability of decline {\textgreater}99.9\%). In 2014, the ratio between counties at the 90th and 10th percentile was 2.0 for ischemic heart disease (119.1 vs 235.7 deaths per 100000 persons) and 1.7 for cerebrovascular disease (40.3 vs 68.1 deaths per 100000 persons). For other cardiovascular disease causes, the ratio ranged from 1.4 (aortic aneurysm: 3.5 vs 5.1 deaths per 100000 persons) to 4.2 (hypertensive heart disease: 4.3 vs 17.9 deaths per 100000 persons). The largest concentration of counties with high cardiovascular disease mortality extended from southeastern Oklahoma along the Mississippi River Valley to eastern Kentucky. Several cardiovascular disease conditions were clustered substantially outside the South, including atrial fibrillation (Northwest), aortic aneurysm (Midwest), and endocarditis (Mountain West and Alaska). The lowest cardiovascular mortality rates were found in the counties surrounding San Francisco, California, central Colorado, northern Nebraska, central Minnesota, northeastern Virginia, and southern Florida. Conclusions and Relevance: Substantial differences exist between county ischemic heart disease and stroke mortality rates. Smaller differences exist for diseases of the myocardium, atrial fibrillation, aortic and peripheral arterial disease, rheumatic heart disease, and endocarditis.},

Depression and anxiety (hospital anxiety and depression scale) and {QoL} (short form-12 health survey) were investigated. Intensity of headache was measured by visual analogous scale. Systolic and diastolic {BP} decreased by -20 +/- 2.4 and -10 +/- 1.4 {mmHg}, respectively, six months after {RDN} (p{\textless}0.0001). Patients showed more correct reactions (p{\textless}0.0001), fewer errors (p{\textless}0.05) and reacted faster (p{\textless}0.001) in the {DT}.

	abstract = {Patients with resistant hypertension present high prevalence of a non-dipper blood pressure pattern. Recent results indicate that non-dipping is related partly to the absence of 24-hour therapeutic coverage in patients treated with single morning doses. Accordingly, we investigated the impact of treatment time on the blood pressure pattern in 700 patients with resistant hypertension on the basis of clinic measurements who were studied by 48-hour ambulatory monitoring. Among them, 299 patients received all their medication on awakening, and 401 were taking {\textgreater} or =1 antihypertensive drug at bedtime. The percentage of patients with controlled ambulatory blood pressure was double in patients taking 1 drug at bedtime (P=0.008). Among the 578 patients with true resistant hypertension, subjects receiving 1 drug at bedtime showed a significant reduction in the 24-hour mean of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (3.1 and 1.6 mm Hg, respectively; P{\textless}0.011). This reduction was much more prominent during nighttime (5.1 and 3.0 mm Hg; P{\textless}0.001). Accordingly, the diurnal/nocturnal blood pressure ratio was significantly increased by 2.7 and the prevalence on non-dipping reduced (56.9 versus 81.9\%; P{\textless}0.001) in patients taking 1 drug at bedtime. Compared with patients receiving all drugs on awakening, subjects with 1 drug at bedtime also showed significant reductions in the average values of glucose, cholesterol, fibrinogen, and urinary albumin excretion (P{\textless}0.011). In patients with resistant hypertension, pharmacological therapy should take into account when to treat with respect to the rest-activity cycle of each patient to improve control and to avoid the non-dipper pattern associated to higher cardiovascular risk.},

	abstract = {The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program ({HDFP}) previously described a significant reduction in five-year, all-cause mortality in its intensively treated stepped care ({SC}) group relative to its referred care ({RC}) control group. At the time this finding was described, a proportion of the {SC} cohort had been treated for periods as long as 6.7 years, but comparable {RC} and {SC} mortality data beyond five years were not available. These data, which are described herein, indicate that the 6.7-year life-table mortality rates were 95.1/1000 participants for {SC} vs 116.3/1000 participants for {RC}, a larger mortality difference than was observed at five years. This favorable finding for {SC} extended to all major subgroups, including white women and those aged 30 to 49 years at trial entry. Six months after the close of the treatment trial, a two-year posttrial surveillance study, which extended mortality follow-up to 8.3 years, was conducted. The posttrial use of antihypertensive medication declined in {SC} and increased in {RC} participants so that by the end of the posttrial period, there was little difference in the percentages of {SC} and {RC} participants taking medication. Control of blood pressure, indicated by mean diastolic blood pressure and by percent of participants with a pressure of 90 mm Hg or less, was slightly better for {SC} than for {RC} participants ({SC} group, 86.5 mm Hg and 68\% controlled; {RC} group, 87.8 mm Hg and 62\% controlled). The absolute mortality advantage found at 6.7 years persisted and increased throughout the posttrial period of follow-up despite discontinuation of the formal {SC} therapy program. It is postulated that regression of hypertensive end-organ changes brought about by the more effective {SC} treatment caused this favorable outcome.},

The 884 patients who underwent post-trial monitoring were asked to attend annual {UKPDS} clinics for the first 5 years, but no attempt was made to maintain their previously assigned therapies. Annual questionnaires completed by patients and general practitioners were used to follow patients who were unable to attend the clinic in years 1 through 5, and questionnaires were used for all patients in years 6 to 10. Seven prespecified aggregate clinical end points were examined on an intention-to-treat basis, according to the previous randomization categories. {RESULTS}: Differences in blood pressure between the two groups during the trial disappeared within 2 years after termination of the trial. Significant relative risk reductions found during the trial for any diabetes-related end point, diabetes-related death, microvascular disease, and stroke in the group receiving tight, as compared with less tight, blood-pressure control were not sustained during the post-trial follow-up. No risk reductions were seen during or after the trial for myocardial infarction or death from any cause, but a risk reduction for peripheral vascular disease associated with tight blood-pressure control became significant (P=0.02). {CONCLUSIONS}: The benefits of previously improved blood-pressure control were not sustained when between-group differences in blood pressure were lost. Early improvement in blood-pressure control in patients with both type 2 diabetes and hypertension was associated with a reduced risk of complications, but it appears that good blood-pressure control must be continued if the benefits are to be maintained.

We assessed the accuracy and reproducibility of a brand of community-based automated device against the standard mercury sphygmomanometer. {METHODS}: Same-arm pairs of blood pressure readings were obtained with the Vita-Stat 90550 automated device, a sphygmomanometer and the Omron {HEM}-705CP automated device in random order on volunteers in 3 community pharmacies using a modified protocol for evaluating blood pressure devices. Comparison of readings between the Omron device and the sphygmomanometer served as a positive control of how well a laboratory-validated automated device could perform in the community. Both the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ({AAMI}) and British Hypertension Society ({BHS}) criteria were used to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of readings. {RESULTS}: The mean blood pressure reading and standard error ({SE}) of the mean for the 108 volunteers (66 women and 42 men) was 133/77 ({SE} 2/1) mm Hg with the Vita-Stat device, 131/77 ({SE} 2/1) mm Hg with the Omron device and 129/76 ({SE} 2/1) mm Hg with the sphygmomanometer. The mean difference in readings was 4.4/1.0 (standard deviation [{SD}] 9.4/6.2) mm Hg between the Vita-Stat device and the sphygmomanometer and 1.6/0.6 ({SD} 9.3/6.4) mm Hg between the Omron device and the sphygmomanometer. Neither automated device met the {AAMI} accuracy criteria for the systolic readings. The {BHS} grades were C/A (systolic unacceptable/diastolic acceptable) for each automated device. According to the {BHS} analytical criterion, all devices achieved acceptable reproducibility grades. {INTERPRETATION}: Neither automated device met the {AAMI} or {BHS} criteria for accuracy while in use in the community, and neither performed as well in the community as in the laboratory.},

The scheme was tested in a group of 76 patients who had true treatment resistant hypertension (24-hour mean blood pressure ≥130/80 mm Hg while receiving three or more drugs). An effective response to spironolactone was defined as 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) drop by more than 20 mm Hg, and was obtained with 25-50 mg in 60 patients (78.9\%). In patients with inadequate response to spironolactone (n = 16), we administered the triple combination plus the remaining therapy, a mean decrease of 29 mm Hg (95\% {CI} 11-48; P = .004) for {SBP} and 12 mm Hg (95\% {CI}: 4-20 mm Hg) for diastolic {BP} were observed. In only 1 of 16 patients (6\%), the response was considered as insufficient.

Although plasma renin activity ({PRA}) is a potential biomarker for personalizing antihypertensive therapy in European American ({EA}) and African American ({AA}) hypertensives, clinical utility of {PRA}-guided prescribing is incompletely understood. {METHODS}: Using systematic-phased approach, {PRA}'s clinical utility was assessed. After categorizing by baseline {PRA}, clinic systolic {BP} ({SBP}) responses to metoprolol and chlorthalidone were compared in 134 {EAs} and 102 {AAs} enrolled in the Pharmacogenomics Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses-2 ({PEAR}-2) trial. Receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) analysis was conducted in {EAs}. Data from {PEAR}-2 {AAs} were used to estimate an optimal {PRA} cut point using multivariable linear regression models. The derived cut point in {AAs} was tested in a meta-analysis of 2 independent {AA} cohorts, and its sensitivity and specificity were assessed. {RESULTS}: {EAs} with {PRA} {\textless} 0.65 ng/ml/hour had a greater decrease in {SBP} to chlorthalidone than metoprolol (by-15.9 mm Hg, adjusted P {\textless} 0.0001), whereas those with {PRA} ≥ 0.65 ng/ml/hour had a greater decrease in {SBP} to metoprolol than chlorthalidone (by 3.3 mm Hg, adjusted P = 0.04). Area under {ROC} curve (0.69, P = 0.0001) showed that {PRA} can predict {SBP} response among {EAs}. However, we observed no association between {PRA} and {SBP} response in {PEAR}-2 {AAs}. Among independent {AA} cohorts, those with {PRA} ≥ 1.3 ng/ml/hour ({PEAR}-2-derived cut point) responded better to atenolol/candesartan than hydrochlorothiazide (meta-analysis P = 0.01). However, sensitivity of the derived cut point was 10\%. {CONCLUSIONS}: {PRA} at the previously established 0.60-0.65 ng/ml/hour cut point is an effective predictive biomarker of {BP} response in {EAs}.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Several approaches to initiation of antihypertensive therapy have been suggested. These include thiazide diuretics ({TDs}) as the first drug in all patients, initial drug selection based on age and race criteria, or therapy selection based on measures of plasma renin activity ({PRA}). It is uncertain which of these strategies achieves the highest control rate with monotherapy in Stage-I hypertension. We sought to compare control rates among these strategies. {METHODS} We used data from the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses study ({PEAR}) to estimate control rates for each strategy: (i) {TD} for all, (ii) age- and race-based strategy: Hydrochlorothiazide ({HCTZ}) for all blacks and for whites ≥50 years and a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (atenolol) for whites {\textless}50 years) or (iii) a {PRA} based strategy: {HCTZ} for suppressed {PRA} ({\textless}0.6ng/ml/h) and atenolol for non-suppressed {PRA} (≥0.6ng/ml/h) despite age or race. Hypertension was confirmed prior to treatment with {HCTZ} (148 blacks and 218 whites) or with atenolol (146 blacks and 221 whites). {RESULTS} In the overall sample, using clinic blood pressure ({BP}) response, the renin-based strategy was associated with the greatest control rate (48.9\% vs. 40.8\% with the age and race-based strategy (P = 0.0004) and 31.7\% with the {TD} for all strategy (P {\textless} 0.0001)). The findings were similar using home or by 24-hour ambulatory {BP} responses and within each racial subgroup. {CONCLUSIONS} A strategy for selection of initial antihypertensive drug therapy based on {PRA} was associated with greater {BP} control rates compared to a thiazide-for-all or an age and race-based strategy.},

	abstract = {Objective To identify patients with hypertension with resistant and controlled blood pressure ({BP}) using electronic health records ({EHRs}) in order to elucidate practices in the real-world clinical treatment of hypertension and to enable future genetic studies.

Design Using {EHRs}, we developed and validated algorithms to identify patients with resistant and controlled hypertension.

Setting An academic medical centre in Nashville, Tennessee.

Population European-American ({EA}) and African-American ({AA}) patients with hypertension.

Main outcome measures Demographic characteristics: race, age, gender, body mass index, outpatient {BPs} and the history of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease stage 3, ischaemic heart disease, transient ischaemic attack, atrial fibrillation and sleep apnoea.

Medication treatment All antihypertensive medication classes prescribed to a patient at the time of classification and ever prescribed following classification.

Results The algorithms had performance metrics exceeding 92\%. The prevalence of resistant hypertension in the total hypertensive population was 7.3\% in {EA} and 10.5\% in {AA}. At diagnosis, {AA} were younger, heavier, more often female and had a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes and higher {BPs} than {EA}. {AA} with resistant hypertension were more likely to be treated with vasodilators, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and alpha-2 agonists while {EA} were more likely to be treated with angiotensin receptor blockers, renin inhibitors and beta blockers. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists use was increased in patients treated with more than four antihypertensive medications compared with patients treated with three (12.4\% vs 2.6\% in {EA}, p{\textless}0.001; 12.3\% vs 2.8\% in {AA}, p{\textless}0.001). The number of patients treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist increased to 37.4\% in {EA} and 41.2\% in {AA} over a mean follow-up period of 7.4 and 8.7 years, respectively.

Conclusions Clinical treatment of resistant hypertension differs in {EA} and {AA} patients. These results demonstrate the feasibility of identifying resistant hypertension using an {EHR}.},

	abstract = {1 P rior {US} and most current other hypertension guidelines define treatment-resistant hypertension ({TRH}) as requiring ≥4 antihypertensive drugs to achieve blood pressure ({BP}) {\textless}140/90 mm Hg, and this phenotype has been consistently linked with increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes, relative to nonresistant hypertension. 1,2 In 2017, {US} hypertension guidelines updated the {TRH} definition to requiring ≥4 antihypertensive drugs to achieve {BP} {\textless}130/80 mm Hg, consistent with the {BP} target promulgated for most hypertensive individuals. 1,3 This expanded definition and recommendations for more intensive treatment, generally , are expected to significantly increase {TRH} incidence and prevalence by now including individuals with presumably lower-risk profiles, that is, people taking 3 antihypertensives with a systolic {BP} between 130 and 139 or diastolic {BP} between 80 and 89 mm Hg. 4 Yet, whether these revised {TRH} criteria identify a population with poor prognosis, similar to that observed with the prior {US} definition, is unknown. Therefore, we sought to compare updated and prior {TRH} definitions on risk of adverse cardiovascular events using patient-level data from the {SPRINT} (Sys-tolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) and {ACCORD} (Action to Control Cardiovas-cular Risk in Diabetes) trials. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS} All data supporting the findings of this study are available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center, accessible at https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/. The design and results of {SPRINT} and {ACCORD} have been published previously. 5,6 Briefly, both were prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-end point trials comparing an intensive ({\textless}120 mm Hg) versus standard ({\textless}140 mm Hg) systolic {BP} target among high-risk individuals with hypertension and diabetes mellitus ({ACCORD}) or hypertension without diabetes mellitus ({SPRINT}) at baseline (see additional detail in the Data Supplement). Patient-level data from both trials were pooled and harmonized (Figure S1 in the Data Supplement); specific data elements included baseline demographics and clinical characteristics (detailed below), clinic {BP} measurements at each visit, medication use at each visit, and outcomes. Daily {BP} values between study visits were estimated using linear interpolation. Medication use and adherence were determined via detailed study medication logs, which included information on specific medications but not doses. Using these data, we determined apparent {TRH} ({aTRH}) status for each patient throughout the trial, taking advantage of treatment arm-specific {BP} targets that allowed definition of {aTRH} according to previous and updated guidelines. The term {aTRH} is used to signify the fact that data constraints (eg, lack of antihypertensive dosing information and out-of-office {BP}) did not allow for exclusion of pseudoresistance. For patients assigned the intensive target, {aTRH} (hereafter, {aTRH} updated) was defined per the 2018 {TRH} scientific statement 1 as a systolic {BP} ≥130 or diastolic {BP} ≥80 mm Hg with adherent use of ≥3 antihypertensive drugs from different classes, including a diuretic; or, adherent use of ≥4 antihypertensive drugs from different classes, including a diuretic, regardless of {BP}. For patients assigned the standard target, {aTRH} (hereafter, {aTRH} prior) was defined per the 2008 {TRH} scientific statement 7 as having a},

Patients were given 12 weeks of once daily treatment with each of placebo, spironolactone 25–50 mg, bisoprolol 5–10 mg, and doxazosin 4–8 mg and the change in home systolic blood pressure was assessed as the primary outcome. In our three substudies, we assessed plasma aldosterone, renin, and aldosterone-to-renin ratio ({ARR}) as predictors of home systolic blood pressure, and estimated prevalence of primary aldosteronism (substudy 1); assessed the effects of each drug in terms of thoracic fluid index, cardiac index, stroke index, and systemic vascular resistance at seven sites with haemodynamic monitoring facilities (substudy 2); and assessed the effect of amiloride 10–20 mg once daily on clinic systolic blood pressure during an optional 6–12 week open-label runout phase (substudy 3).

Home systolic blood pressure reduction by spironolactone was predicted by {ARR} (\textit{r}$^{\textrm{2}}$=0·13, p{\textless}0·0001) and plasma renin (\textit{r}$^{\textrm{2}}$=0·11, p=0·00024). 42 patients had low renin concentrations (predefined as the lowest tertile of plasma renin), of which 31 had a plasma aldosterone concentration greater than the mean value for all 126 patients (250 pmol/L). Thus, 31 (25\% [95\% {CI} 17–33]) of 126 patients were deemed to have inappropriately high aldosterone concentrations. Thoracic fluid content was reduced by 6·8\% from baseline (95\% {CI} 4·0 to 8·8; p{\textless}0·0001) with spironolactone, but not other treatments. Amiloride (10 mg once daily) reduced clinic systolic blood pressure by 20·4 mm Hg (95\% {CI} 18·3–22·5), compared with a reduction of 18·3 mm Hg (16·2–20·5) with spironolactone (25 mg once daily). No serious adverse events were recorded, and adverse symptoms were not systematically recorded after the end of the double-blind treatment. Mean plasma potassium concentrations increased from 4·02 mmol/L (95\% {CI} 3·95–4·08) on placebo to 4·50 (4·44–4·57) on amiloride (p{\textless}0·0001).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Our results suggest that resistant hypertension is commonly a salt-retaining state, most likely due to inappropriate aldosterone secretion.

The practice includes primary care physicians, nurses, a care navigator, and pharmacists. Pharmacy services are provided by pharmacists, including {PGY}-1 pharmacy residents and pharmacy students.Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted to perform a pre-post analysis on all patients referred to pharmacists within an adult medicine clinic. Patients were included if they were more than 18 years old; were referred for type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or medication reconciliation; and were seen from August 2010 to March 2011. All charts were reviewed to assess pharmacist impact on adherence to standards of care including hemoglobin A1c; lipids; blood pressure; vaccination status; usage of aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins; and other criteria. Subgroup analysis was performed on diabetic patients who were not at goal at the time of referral to the pharmacy clinic.Results: Ninety-three charts were reviewed. In the overall group, rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination improved significantly, as did annual foot and eye exams in diabetics. Pharmacists significantly decreased A1c from 9.12\% at baseline to 8.13\% (P {\textless} .001), systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) from 142.6 to 133.5 mm Hg (P {\textless} .001), and low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}) from 143.6 to 103.2 mg/{dL} (P {\textless} .001) in diabetic patients who were not at goal at baseline.Conclusions: Pharmacists were effective in improving surrogate outcomes for patients with diabetes and in assisting physicians to address all standards of care.},

Patients at risk for malnutrition or with moderate to severe cognitive impairment were excluded. The primary end point was absolute change in {HbA}1c from baseline to week 24. Secondary end points included change from baseline to week 24 in 2-h postprandial plasma glucose ({PPG}) and body weight. {RESULTS} A total of 350 patients were randomized. {HbA}1c decreased substantially with lixisenatide (20.57\% [6.2 mmol/mol]) compared with placebo (+0.06\% [0.7 mmol/mol]) from baseline to week 24 (P {\textless} 0.0001).

Problem: Developing a national pragmatic clinical trial infrastructure is central to understanding the effectiveness of interventions applied under usual conditions and where people receive health care. To address this challenge, three Florida universities-the University of Florida Clinical and Translational Science Institute, Florida State University (with its communitybased distributive medical education model), and the University of Miami-created (2010-2013) a statewide consortium, the {OneFlorida} Clinical Research Consortium, to support the conduct of pragmatic clinical trials and provide mentored research experiences for medical and graduate students in real-world practice settings. Approach: {OneFlorida} has four programs, which report to a steering committee with membership from each partner, community members, and the state Medicaid agency and Department of Health to ensure shared governance. The Clinical Research Program provides support to conduct research in the network and uses champions to engage community clinicians. The Citizen Scientist Program has community members who provide input on health topics of importance to them, study design, recruitment and retention strategies, and the interpretation of findings. The Data Trust Program contains electronic health record and health care claims data for 10.6 million Floridians. The Minority Education Program, in collaboration with three historically black colleges and universities, offers minority junior faculty mentoring in pragmatic clinical trials and implementation science. Outcomes: {OneFlorida} has implemented 27 studies with diverse patient populations and in diverse community practice settings.

The objective of this study was to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with central pressures in patients with uncomplicated hypertension. We prospectively examined peripheral {BP}, central aortic {BP}, and arterial wall properties and wave reflection in 57 subjects with uncomplicated essential hypertension in the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses ({PEAR}) Study. Significant predictors of central {SBP} included height, smoking status, heart rate ({HR}), and peripheral systolic {BP} ({SBP}), while central diastolic {BP} ({DBP}) was explained by peripheral {DBP} and {HR}. These variables accounted for nearly all of the variability in central {SBP} and central {DBP} (R2= 0.94 and R2= 0.98, respectively). Central pulse pressure variability was largely explained by gender, ex-smoking status, {HR}, peripheral {SBP}, and peripheral {DBP} (R2= 0.94). Central augmented pressure had a direct relationship with smoking status, peripheral {SBP}, and duration of hypertension, whereas it was indirectly related to height, {HR}, and peripheral {DBP}. Easily obtainable demographic and clinical factors are associated with central pressures in essential hypertensive persons. These relationships should be considered in future studies to improve assessment of {BP} to reduce cardiovascular risk and mortality. © 2014 American Society of Hypertension. All rights reserved.},

Intervention. Monotherapy with oral hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 or 25 mg/day for 9 weeks. Measurements and Main Results. Fasting serum glucose, serum potassium, and plasma insulin levels were obtained at baseline (before hydrochlorothiazide therapy was started) and after 9 weeks of therapy. Significant elevations were noted in fasting serum glucose (mean ± {SD} 3.42 ± 10.38 mg/dl, p{\textless}0.0001) and plasma insulin (2.35 ± 9.47 μ{IU}/ml, p{\textless}0.0001) levels, and a significant reduction in serum potassium level (0.30 ± 0.44 {mEq}/L, p{\textless}0.0001) was noted.

	abstract = {Background Thiazides and Β-blockers cause adverse metabolic effects ({AMEs}), but whether these effects share predictors with blood pressure ({BP}) response is unknown. We aimed to determine whether {AMEs} are correlated with {BP} response in uncomplicated hypertensives. Methods In a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group trial, we enrolled 569 persons, aged 17-65, with random assignment to 9 weeks of daily hydrochlorothiazide ({HCTZ}) or atenolol monotherapy, followed by 9 weeks of add-on therapy with the alternate agent. Measurements included home {BP}, averaged over 1 week, weight and fasting levels of serum glucose, low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}), high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}), triglycerides, and uric acid ({UA}) before and after monotherapy and after add-on therapy. Results Increases in {UA} correlated with reductions in systolic {BP} ({SBP}) (r = 0.18; P = 0.003) and diastolic {BP} ({DBP}) (r = 0.20; P = 0.001) following {HCTZ} monotherapy and add-on therapy (r = 0.27 and r = 0.21, respectively; both P{\textless} 0.001). After adjustment for age, race, gender, and baseline body mass index ({BMI}), only the correlation between {UA} and {DBP} response became nonsignificant. Reductions in {HDL} correlated with systolic response following atenolol monotherapy (r = 0.18; P = 0.002) and with systolic and diastolic response following add-on therapy (r = 0.30 and r = 0.24, respectively; both P{\textless} 0.0001). These correlations remained significant after covariate adjustment. {BP} responses were not correlated with changes in glucose, {LDL}, triglycerides, or weight following either therapy. Conclusions {BP} response correlated with changes in {UA} following {HCTZ} therapy and {HDL} following atenolol therapy. No other significant correlations were observed between {BP} response and {AMEs}, suggesting that these effects generally do not share predictors. Patients should be monitored for {AMEs}, regardless of {BP} response. © 2012 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

In this post-hoc {INternational} {VErapamil} {SR}-Trandolapril {STudy} ({INVEST}) analysis, we assessed prevalence, predictors, and impact on outcomes of res-{HTN} in {CAD} patients with hypertension. Methods: Participants (n=17190) were divided into three groups according to achieved blood pressure ({BP}): controlled ({BP} {\textless}140/90mmHg on three or fewer drugs); uncontrolled ({BP} ≥140/90mmHg on two or fewer drugs); or resistant ({BP} ≥140/90mmHg on three drugs or any patient on at least four drugs). Results: The prevalence of res-{HTN} was 38\%: significant predictors of res-{HTN} included heart failure [odds ratio ({OR}) 1.73], diabetes ({OR} 1.63), Black race ({OR} 1.50), and {US} residence ({OR} 1.50). Compared with controlled {HTN}, res-{HTN} had multivariate-adjusted association with higher risk of adverse outcomes \{first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke [hazard ratio 1.27, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.13-1.43], and individual outcomes of all-cause death (hazard ratio 1.29, 95\% {CI} 1.13-1.48), cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.47, 95\% {CI} 1.21-1.78), and nonfatal stroke (hazard ratio 1.61, 95\% {CI} 1.17-2.22), but not nonfatal myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 0.98, 95\% {CI} 0.72-1.34)\}. Adverse outcomes, except nonfatal stroke, did not differ in patients with res-{HTN} compared to uncontrolled {HTN}. {ConclusionS}: Res-{HTN} is common in patients with {CAD} and hypertension, associated with poor prognosis, and linked with a number of conditions. Emphasis should be placed on recognizing those at risk for res-{HTN} and future studies should examine whether more aggressive treatment of res-{HTN} improves outcomes. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health {\textbar} Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

Aims: The 2012 American College of Chest Physician Evidence-Based Management of Anticoagulant Therapy guidelines suggest an international normalized ratio ({INR}) testing interval of up to 12 weeks, rather than every 4 weeks, for patients with consistently stable {INRs} while taking vitamin K antagonists. We aimed to examine the feasibility of extended-interval follow-up in a real-world setting. Methods: Patients receiving stable warfarin therapy for ≥12 weeks at baseline began extended-interval follow-up with visits occurring at 6 weeks, 14 weeks, and every 12 weeks thereafter to a maximum of 68 weeks or until they were no longer suitable for extended-interval follow-up. A single {INR} excursion {\textgreater}0.3 from goal was permitted if a reversible precipitating factor was identified and the {INR} was expected to return to goal without dose adjustment. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients completing all study follow-up visits. Results: Of 48 patients enrolled, 47 had evaluable data. The most common indication for anticoagulation was atrial fibrillation/flutter (53.2\%). At baseline, mean prior warfarin treatment duration was 6.7 ± 6 years and median number of weeks on a stable regimen was 24 weeks ({IQR}, 19-37.5). Eleven patients (23\%) completed all study follow-up visits, whereas 17 (36\%) did not maintain a stable {INR} past the 14-week follow-up. Conclusion: A large proportion of patients with previously stable (≥3 months) {INRs} were not able to maintain stable {INRs} during extended-interval follow-up.

	abstract = {Resistant hypertension ({RH}) is defined as above-goal elevated blood pressure ({BP}) in a patient despite the concurrent use of 3 antihypertensive drug classes, commonly including a long-acting calcium channel blocker, a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker), and a diuretic. The antihypertensive drugs should be administered at maximum or maximally tolerated daily doses. {RH} also includes patients whose {BP} achieves target values on ≥4 antihypertensive medications. The diagnosis of {RH} requires assurance of antihypertensive medication adherence and exclusion of the "white-coat effect" (office {BP} above goal but out-of-office {BP} at or below target). The importance of {RH} is underscored by the associated risk of adverse outcomes compared with non-{RH}. This article is an updated American Heart Association scientific statement on the detection, evaluation, and management of {RH}. Once antihypertensive medication adherence is confirmed and out-of-office {BP} recordings exclude a white-coat effect, evaluation includes identification of contributing lifestyle issues, detection of drugs interfering with antihypertensive medication effectiveness, screening for secondary hypertension, and assessment of target organ damage. Management of {RH} includes maximization of lifestyle interventions, use of long-acting thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone or indapamide), addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone), and, if {BP} remains elevated, stepwise addition of antihypertensive drugs with complementary mechanisms of action to lower {BP}. If {BP} remains uncontrolled, referral to a hypertension specialist is advised.},

Program includes educational sessions focused on nutrition, fitness, and behavioral therapy. Medication costs were based on Average Wholesale Prices, tabulated from the 2010 Red Book. Results: A total of 36 patients (49-80 years old) enrolled, of which 27 patients have diabetes mellitus (Type 2 = 26, Type 1 = 1). Mean 30-day anti-diabetic medication costs decreased by \$142.92.

Participants were generally satisfied with the program. Conclusions: Employing a multidisciplinary wellness program within an endocrinology practice can reduce anti-diabetic medication expenses; however, long term follow-up is needed to determine if medication reductions and improved clinical parameters persist. © 2013 Diabetes India.

The effects of pharmacologically dissimilar β-blockers on these properties have not been fully elucidated. Patients with essential hypertension and without significant concomitant cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to controlled-release carvedilol, force-titrated to 80mg (n=22), or atenolol, force-titrated to 100mg (n=19); each was given once daily for 4weeks. Baseline characteristics were similar. At the end of week 4, atenolol and carvedilol reduced central and brachial systolic and diastolic {BP} to a similar extent. Central augmentation index was increased in atenolol-treated patients but not carvedilol-treated patients (atenolol 4.47\% vs carvedilol -0.68\%; P=.04). Mean augmented central aortic pressure increased slightly during atenolol treatment (+1.1mmHg) but decreased slightly during carvedilol treatment (-1.1mmHg), although the difference in these changes was not statistically significant (P=.23). Pulse pressure amplification was reduced more with atenolol at week 4 (atenolol -10.7\% vs carvedilol -1.8\%; P=.02).

Methods: We assessed intensive ({\textless}120 mm Hg) versus standard ({\textless}140 mm Hg) systolic blood pressure targets on adverse outcome risk according to baseline resistant hypertension status, using Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ({ACCORD}) and Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial ({SPRINT}) patient-level data. Patients were categorized as having baseline apparent resistant hypertension (blood pressure ≥130/80 mm Hg while using 3 antihypertensive drugs or use of ≥4 drugs regardless of blood pressure) or non-resistant hypertension (all others). Cox regression was used to assess effects of treatment assignment, resistant hypertension status, their interaction, and other covariates, on first occurrence of 2 outcomes: myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death ± heart failure, and the same outcomes plus all-cause death, individually. Results: Among 14,094 patients, 2710 (19.2\%) had baseline apparent resistant hypertension. In adjusted models, an intensive target reduced risk of both outcomes (myocardial infarction/stroke/cardiovascular death: hazard ratio [{HR}], 0.81; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.71-0.93; myocardial infarction/stroke/heart failure/cardiovascular death: {HR} 0.78; 95\% {CI}, 0.69-0.88) as well as stroke ({HR} 0.72; 95\% {CI}, 0.55-0.94) and heart failure ({HR} 0.73; 95\% {CI}, 0.59-0.91). An intensive target also appeared to reduce myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death risk. Benefits were observed irrespective of baseline resistant hypertension status. Conclusions: Our findings provide the first evidence to support guidance to treat resistant hypertension to the same blood pressure goal as non-resistant hypertension.},

With this increased attention has come a considerably better understanding of disease epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment, yet much remains unknown. Current data suggest that the prevalence of resistant hypertension has been increasing in recent decades, a concerning finding given that resistant hypertension appears to be associated with a poorer prognosis than nonresistant hypertension. The most appropriate management for these patients has not been fully elucidated, but a multifaceted approach incorporating accurate diagnosis, identification, and removal of substances that interfere with blood pressure, dietary and lifestyle management, and treatment with rational drug combination therapy can be quite effective in controlling blood pressure in these patients.

We sought to use predictive data mining and high dimensional analytics of electronic health record ({EHR}) data to develop a highly accurate and clinically actionable 5 year life expectancy index. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We developed the index using {EHR} data for 7463 patients {\textgreater}/=50 years old with {\textgreater}/=1 visit(s) in 2003 to a large, academic, multispecialty group practice. We extracted 980 attributes from the {EHRs} of the practices and affiliated hospitals. Correlation feature selection with greedy stepwise search was used to find the attribute subset with best average merit. Rotation forest ensembling with alternating decision tree as underlying classifier was used to predict 5 year mortality. Model performance was compared with the modified Charlson Comorbidity Index and the Walter life expectancy method. {RESULTS}: Within 5 years of the last visit in 2003, 838 (11\%) patients had died. The final model included 24 attributes: two demographic (age, sex), 10 comorbidity (eg, cardiovascular disease), one vital sign (mean diastolic blood pressure), two medications (loop diuretic use, digoxin use), six laboratory (eg, mean albumin), and three healthcare utilization (eg, the number of hospitalizations 1 year prior to the last visit in 2003). The index showed very good discrimination (c-statistic 0.86) and outperformed comparators. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {EHR} based index successfully distinguished adults {\textgreater}/=50 years old with life expectancy {\textgreater}5 years from those with life expectancy {\textless}/=5 years. This information could be used clinically to optimize preventive service use (eg, cancer screening in the elderly).},

	abstract = {Observational studies indicate a significant relation between dietary sodium and level of blood pressure. However, the role of salt sensitivity in the development of resistant hypertension is unknown. The present study examined the effects of dietary salt restriction on office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in subjects with resistant hypertension. Twelve subjects with resistant hypertension entered into a randomized crossover evaluation of low (50 mmol/24 hours x 7 days) and high sodium diets (250 mmol/24 hours x 7 days) separated by a 2-week washout period. Brain natriuretic peptide; plasma renin activity; 24-hour urinary aldosterone, sodium, and potassium; 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; aortic pulse wave velocity; and augmentation index were compared between dietary treatment periods. At baseline, subjects were on an average of 3.4+/-0.5 antihypertensive medications with a mean office {BP} of 145.8+/-10.8/83.9+/-11.2 mm Hg. Mean urinary sodium excretion was 46.1+/-26.8 versus 252.2+/-64.6 mmol/24 hours during low- versus high-salt intake. Low- compared to high-salt diet decreased office systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 22.7 and 9.1 mm Hg, respectively. Plasma renin activity increased whereas brain natriuretic peptide and creatinine clearance decreased during low-salt intake, indicative of intravascular volume reduction. These results indicate that excessive dietary sodium ingestion contributes importantly to resistance to antihypertensive treatment. Strategies to substantially reduce dietary salt intake should be part of the overall treatment of resistant hypertension.},

The clinical effectiveness of Barostim was based on the results of the randomized, placebo-controlled Rheos trial and the follow-up substudy of the {DEBuT}-{HT} trial. The cost-effectiveness was modelled from a German societal perspective over a lifetime horizon. Patients with high {SBP} levels have an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and end-stage renal disease. {RESULTS}: In a simulated cohort of 50-year-old patients at high risk of end-organ damage, Barostim therapy generated 1.66 additional life-years and 2.17 additional quality-adjusted life years with an incremental cost of \&{OV}0556;16 891 when compared with continuation of medical management. Barostim was estimated to be cost-effective compared with optimal medical treatment with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \&{OV}0556;7 797/{QALY}. In the model, Barostim reduced over a lifetime the rates of myocardial infarction by 19\%, stroke by 35\%, heart failure by 12\% and end-stage renal disease by 23\%. The cost-effectiveness of Barostim can be greater in younger patients with resistant hypertension and in patients with significant risk factors for end-organ damage. {CONCLUSION}: Barostim may be a cost-effective treatment when compared with optimal medical management in patients with resistant hypertension.},

Vital sign predictors were constructed using combinations of age-adjusted abnormalities in heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation to predict impending deterioration. Sensitivity and specificity were determined for vital sign-based predictors by using 1:1 age-matched and sex-matched non-{ICU} control patients. Sensitivity and specificity for a model consisting of any two vital sign measurements simultaneously outside of age-adjusted normal ranges for condition A, condition C, and condition A or C were 64\% and 54\%, 57\% and 53\%, and 59\% and 54\%, respectively. The pediatric Rothman Index (added to the electronic medical record in April 2009) was evaluated in a subset of these patients (n = 131) and 16,138 hospitalized unmatched non-{ICU} control patients for the ability to predict condition A or C, and receiver operating characteristic curves were generated. Sensitivity and specificity for a pediatric Rothman Index cutoff of 40 for condition A, condition C, and condition A or C were 56\% and 99\%, 13\% and 99\%, and 28\% and 99\%, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS}: A model consisting of simultaneous vital sign abnormalities and the pediatric Rothman Index predict condition A or C in the 24-hour period prior to the event. Vital sign only prediction models have higher sensitivity than the pediatric Rothman Index but are associated with a high false-positive rate. The high specificity of the pediatric Rothman Index merits prospective evaluation as an electronic adjunct to human-triggered early warning systems.},

Three different instruments were used: {SF}-12 physical component scale ({PCS}-12) and mental component scale ({MCS}-12); {EQ}-5D index and visual analogue scale ({VAS}). Censored least absolute deviation was used for the {EQ}-5D and {VAS} (due to censoring) and ordinary least squares ({OLS}) was used for the {PCS}-12 and {MCS}-12. {RESULTS}: After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension were associated with significantly lower scores compared to normal weight individuals without the condition for all four instruments. Obesity significantly exacerbated this association. Controlling for comorbidity attenuated the negative association of obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors on instrument scores. In addition, scores decreased for increasing weight and number of risk factors. {CONCLUSIONS}: Obesity significantly exacerbates the deleterious association between diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, and health function, health perception, and preference-based scores in the United States.},

	abstract = {The {UK} National Health Service ({NHS}) currently spends in excess of £250 million per annum on angiotensin {II} receptor blockers ({ARBs}) for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure; with candesartan currently dominating the market. With the recent introduction of generic losartan, we set out to directly compare the branded market leader to its now cheaper alternative. The primary objectives were to compare the blood pressure ({BP}) lowering efficacy and cardiovascular outcomes of candesartan and losartan in the treatment of essential hypertension and chronic heart failure, respectively. The secondary objective was to model their comparative incremental cost-effectiveness in a {UK} {NHS} setting. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2), which contains the Hypertension and Heart Group's specialist register, Medline (1950-February 2010), and Embase (1980-February 2010) were included in the search strategy. Selection criteria were randomised studies of candesartan versus losartan in adults ({\textgreater} 18 years). The main outcome measures were as follows: Hypertension: mean change from baseline in trough (24 h postdose) systolic and diastolic {BP}. Heart failure: composite of cardiovascular death and hospital admission for management of heart failure. Two reviewers applied inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. Eight (three of which met inclusion criteria) and zero trials compared candesartan directly with losartan in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, respectively. A between-treatment difference of -1.96 {mmHg} [95\% confidence interval ({CI}) -2.40 to -1.51] for trough diastolic {BP} and -3.00 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} -3.79 to -2.22) for trough systolic {BP} in favour of candesartan was observed. Based on this differential, a 10-year Markov model estimates the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained to exceed £40,000 for using candesartan in place of generic losartan. Candesartan reduces {BP} to a slightly greater extent when compared with losartan, however, such difference is unlikely to be cost-effective based on current acquisition costs, perceived {NHS} affordability thresholds and use of combination regimens. We could find no robust evidence supporting the superiority of candesartan over losartan in the treatment of heart failure. We therefore recommend using generic losartan as the {ARB} of choice which could save the {UK} {NHS} approximately £200 million per annum in drug costs.},

An algorithm was developed to identify patients with treated type 2 diabetes and estimate its annual prevalence in Luxembourg using health insurance claims when no diagnosis code is available. {METHODS}: The {DIABECOLUX} algorithm was based on patients' age as well as type and number of hypoglycemic agents reimbursed between 1995 and 2006. Algorithm validation was performed using the results of a national study based on medical data. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were estimated. {RESULTS}: The sensitivity of the {DIABECOLUX} algorithm was found superior to 98.2\%. Between 2000 and 2006, 22,178 patients were treated for diabetes in Luxembourg, among whom 21,068 for type 2 diabetes (95\%). The prevalence was estimated at 3.79\% in 2006 and followed an increasing linear trend during the period. In 2005, the prevalence was low for young age classes and increased rapidly from 40 to 70 for male and 80 for female, reaching a peak of, respectively 17.0\% and 14.3\% before decreasing. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {DIABECOLUX} algorithm is relevant to identify treated type 2 diabetes patients. It is reproducible and should be transferable to every country using medico-administrative databases not including diagnosis codes. Although undiagnosed patients and others with lifestyle recommendations only were not considered in this study, this algorithm is a cheap and easy-to-use tool to inform health authorities. Further studies will use this tool with the aim of improving the quality of health care dedicated to diabetic patients in Luxembourg.},

Hypertensive patients were identified as those with a medical diagnosis for hypertension based on International Classification of Diseases ({ICD})-9 codes; patients who were consumers of hypertension-related medical care services including inpatient and outpatient visits, emergency room visits, home health visits, office-based medical provider visits, and other medical expenses; patients who self-reported being diagnosed with hypertension by their physicians; and patients who were prescribed antihypertensive medication. Incremental expenditure of treating hypertension was estimated through least-squares regression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education, and comorbidities using the D'Hoore et al version of the Charlson comorbidity index. Sample data were projected to the U.S. population and 95\% confidence limits for estimates were calculated using the Taylor expansion method. {RESULTS}: Sample estimates projected to the population indicated that approximately 17.4\% of individuals {\textgreater}or=18 years of age in the ambulatory population have hypertension. Total incremental annual direct expenditures for hypertension patients were estimated to be more than 54.0 billion {US} dollars in 2001 after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities. Mean incremental annual direct expenditures for an individual with hypertension was 1,131 {US} dollars . Prescription medicines, inpatient visits, and outpatient visits constituted {\textgreater}90\% of overall incremental expenditures. {CONCLUSIONS}: With incremental direct medical expenditures estimated at nearly 55.0 billion {US} dollars, hypertension expenditures represent a significant amount of health care resource use.},

	abstract = {Although the benefits of antihypertensive treatment in "young" elderly (under 70 years) hypertensive patients are well established, the value of treatment in older patients (70-84 years) is less clear. The Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension ({STOP}-Hypertension) was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, intervention study set up to compare the effects of active antihypertensive therapy (three beta-blockers and one diuretic) and placebo on the frequency of fatal and non-fatal stroke and myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular death in hypertensive Swedish men and women aged 70-84 years. We recruited 1627 patients at 116 health centres throughout Sweden, who were willing to participate, and who met the entry criteria of three separate recordings during a 1-month placebo run-in period of systolic blood pressure between 180 and 230 mm Hg with a diastolic pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, or a diastolic pressure between 105 and 120 mm Hg irrespective of the systolic pressure. The total duration of the study was 65 months and the average time in the study was 25 months. 812 patients were randomly allocated active treatment and 815 placebo. The mean difference in supine blood pressure between the active treatment and placebo groups at the last follow-up before an endpoint, death, or study termination was 19.5/8.1 mm Hg. Compared with placebo, active treatment significantly reduced the number of primary endpoints (94 vs 58; p = 0.0031) and stroke morbidity and mortality (53 vs 29; p = 0.0081). Although we did not set out to study an effect on total mortality, we also noted a significantly reduced number of deaths in the active treatment group (63 vs 36; p = 0.0079). The benefits of treatment were discernible up to age 84 years. We conclude that antihypertensive treatment in hypertensive men and women aged 70-84 confers highly significant and clinically relevant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as in total mortality.},

	abstract = {Resistant hypertension is currently defined as the failure to achieve a goal blood pressure {\textless}140/90 {mmHg} in patients who are compliant with maximal tolerated doses of a minimum of three antihypertensive drugs, one of which must be a diuretic. The increasing prevalence of obesity and hypertension in the general population mean that this disorder has gained attention in the past decade. In the past 2 years, large-scale population-based studies such as the {US} National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES}) have specifically examined the prevalence and incidence of resistant hypertension, and associated risk factors. The findings suggest the prevalence of resistant hypertension is 8-12\% of adult patients with hypertension (6-9 million people). The increasing prevalence of resistant hypertension contrasts with the improvement in blood pressure control rates during the same period. Studies also show that patients with resistant hypertension aged {\textgreater}55 years, of black ethnicity, with high {BMI}, diabetes or chronic kidney disease have an increased risk of cardiovascular events compared to nonresistant hypertensive patients. Analyses that exclude the effects of white-coat hypertension and pseudoresistant hypertension are also needed to clarify the epidemiology of true resistant hypertension.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The age-specific relevance of blood pressure to cause-specific mortality is best assessed by collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from the separate prospective studies. {METHODS}: Information was obtained on each of one million adults with no previous vascular disease recorded at baseline in 61 prospective observational studies of blood pressure and mortality. During 12.7 million person-years at risk, there were about 56000 vascular deaths (12000 stroke, 34000 ischaemic heart disease [{IHD}], 10000 other vascular) and 66000 other deaths at ages 40-89 years. Meta-analyses, involving "time-dependent" correction for regression dilution, related mortality during each decade of age at death to the estimated usual blood pressure at the start of that decade. {FINDINGS}: Within each decade of age at death, the proportional difference in the risk of vascular death associated with a given absolute difference in usual blood pressure is about the same down to at least 115 mm Hg usual systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) and 75 mm Hg usual diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}), below which there is little evidence. At ages 40-69 years, each difference of 20 mm Hg usual {SBP} (or, approximately equivalently, 10 mm Hg usual {DBP}) is associated with more than a twofold difference in the stroke death rate, and with twofold differences in the death rates from {IHD} and from other vascular causes. All of these proportional differences in vascular mortality are about half as extreme at ages 80-89 years as at ages 40-49 years, but the annual absolute differences in risk are greater in old age. The age-specific associations are similar for men and women, and for cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral ischaemia. For predicting vascular mortality from a single blood pressure measurement, the average of {SBP} and {DBP} is slightly more informative than either alone, and pulse pressure is much less informative. {INTERPRETATION}: Throughout middle and old age, usual blood pressure is strongly and directly related to vascular (and overall) mortality, without any evidence of a threshold down to at least 115/75 mm Hg.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to estimate the effect of addition of low-dose spironolactone to previous antihypertensive therapy in patients with resistant hypertension. Patients had 25 to 50 mg of spironolactone once daily added to the treatment of hypertension that was uncontrolled despite previous treatment with three classes of antihypertensive drugs. The effect on blood pressure was estimated by office measurements together with serum potassium and adverse effects. The data were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 544 patients were identified; 200 were excluded because of secondary hypertension, other indications for spironolactone than hypertension, previous antihypertensive therapy with less than three drugs unless demonstrated intolerance to a third drug, insufficient compliance, and lack of follow-up data. Thus, 344 cases were included in the analysis. The population was 62.1 ± 12.8 years old, 45.1\% were males, and 43\% had cardiovascular comorbidity. Mean blood pressure before the addition of spironolactone was 169/88 mm Hg. At 1, 3, and 6 months after the addition, blood pressure was decreased by an average of 16.6/7.0, 23.9/9.7, and 26.0/10.7 mm Hg (all P {\textless} .001). Serum potassium increased from an average of 3.7 mmol/L to 4.1 mmol/L (P {\textless} .001). Spironolactone was discontinued because of hyperkalemia in 4.1\% of the cases. A total of 18\% of all patients had adverse effects, which in 9.9\% led to discontinuation of the drug. A total of 5.2\% of the males developed gynecomastia. In conclusion, low-dose spironolactone is highly effective when added to previous treatment of patients with resistant hypertension.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cardiorespiratory stabilization is recommended before surgical repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia ({CDH}) because surgery may induce a transitory deterioration of chest compliance and gas exchange. It is not known if surgical intervention can affect cerebral circulation and oxygenation. {AIM}: The aim of the study was to assess noninvasively, by near-infrared spectroscopy, the possible changes in cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation associated with surgical repair of {CDH}. {SUBJECTS}: Twenty-five newborns with severe {CDH} (birth weight, 3057 +/- 354 g; gestational age, 37.8 +/- 1.8 weeks; male/female newborns, 15/10; left/right {CDH}, 19/6) were sedated, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated by conventional gentle ventilation and surgically corrected at a median age of 2.7 days (min-max, 2-14 days) after cardiorespiratory stabilization. {METHODS}: Heart rate ({HR} [beats per minute]), preductal transcutaneous oxygen saturation ({tcSaO}2 [\%]), carbon dioxide tension ({tcPCO}2 [Torr]), and mean arterial blood pressure (mm Hg) were continuously monitored. Inspired fractional oxygen concentration ({FIO}2) was adjusted to maintain and preductal {tcSaO}2 of greater than 80\%, whereas the ventilator's settings were kept unchanged throughout the surgical procedure. Cerebral hemodynamics was assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy ({NIRO} 300, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan), recording continuously and noninvasively the relative changes in concentration of oxygenated ({DeltaO}2Hb [micromol/L]), deoxygenated ({DeltaHHb} [micromol/L]), and total ({DeltatHb} [micromol/L]) hemoglobin; the tissue oxygenation index ({TOI} [\%]) was also calculated ({TOI} = O2Hb/O2Hb + {HHb}). Total hemoglobin concentration is considered to be representative of cerebral blood volume. Arterial blood gases were also measured at the beginning (T1) and at the end of surgery (T2). For all measurements, results at T1 and at T2, as well as the differences between T1 and T2, have been expressed as means or medians and {SDs} or 95\% confidence intervals or ranges. The differences between T1 and T2 were considered statistically significant for a P value of less than .05 by the Student t test for paired values. {RESULTS}: At T1, mean {tcSaO}2\% was 94.1 \% ({SD}, 4.6) with a {FIO}2 of 0.25 ({SD}, 0.1); at T2, to obtain similar values of {tcSaO}2 (93.4\%; {SD}, 4.4), it was necessary to increase the {FIO}2 to 0.37 ({SD}, 0.14; P {\textless} .001). Mean {HR} at T1 was 149.5 beats per minute ({SD}, 9.1) and increased significantly (P {\textless} .05) at T2 (165.2 beats per minute; {SD}, 14.2). Mean arterial blood pressure was 54.7 mm Hg ({SD}, 7.7) at T1 and did not change appreciably at T2 (55.6 mm Hg; {SD}, 8.1). Moreover, {tcPCO}2 did not change significantly during the procedure (mean {tcPCO}2 = 49.9 Torr [{SD}, 12.8] at T1 and 57.3 mm Hg [{SD}, 17.9] at T2). O2Hb and {tHb} decreased (P {\textless} .001 and {\textless}.005) and {HHb} increased (P {\textless} .05) significantly during the surgical procedure (mean Delta [{SD}]: {DeltaO}2Hb= -10.9 micromol/L [9.7], {DeltatHb} = -7.5 micromol/L [11.7], and {DeltaHHb} = -3.5 micromol/L [6.8]). Mean {TOI} was 70\% at T1 (normal values {\textgreater}60\%) and decreased significantly at T2 (mean {DeltaTOI} = -6.1\% [{SD}, 10.6]). In all infants, the greatest changes occurred when the viscera were positioned into the abdomen. {CONCLUSIONS}: Notwithstanding the initial cardiorespiratory stabilization, surgical repair of {CDH} was associated with a rise in {HR} and oxygen requirement and a drop in cerebral {tHb} and O2Hb, suggesting a reduction in cerebral blood volume and oxygenation. These events were probably due to the combined effects of an increase in right to left shunting (as indicated by the increased oxygen requirement) and a decrease in venous return (possibly due to compression of the inferior vena cava by the viscera positioned into the abdomen). These preliminary results reinforce the importance of achieving a good cardiorespiratory stability before undertaking surgical correction of {CDH} to minimize the possible interference of the procedure with cerebral circulation and oxygenation.},

The global burden of {IHD} increased by 29 million disability-adjusted life-years (29\% increase) between 1990 and 2010. About 32.4\% of the growth in global {IHD} disability-adjusted life-years between 1990 and 2010 was attributable to aging of the world population, 22.1\% was attributable to population growth, and total disability-adjusted life-years were attenuated by a 25.3\% decrease in per capita {IHD} burden (decreased rate). The number of people living with nonfatal {IHD} increased more than the number of {IHD} deaths since 1990, but {\textgreater}90\% of {IHD} disability-adjusted life-years in 2010 were attributable to {IHD} deaths. {CONCLUSIONS}: Globally, age-standardized acute myocardial infarction incidence and angina prevalence have decreased, and ischemic heart failure prevalence has increased since 1990. Despite decreased age-standardized fatal and nonfatal {IHD} in most regions since 1990, population growth and aging led to a higher global burden of {IHD} in 2010.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}: Self-monitoring and self-titration of antihypertensives (self-management) is a novel intervention which improves blood pressure control. However, little evidence exists regarding the cost-effectiveness of self-monitoring of blood pressure in general and self-management in particular. This study aimed to evaluate whether self-management of hypertension was cost-effective. {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: A cohort Markov model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken extrapolating to up to 35 years from cost and outcome data collected from the telemonitoring and self-management in hypertension trial ({TASMINH}2). Self-management of hypertension was compared with usual care in terms of lifetime costs, quality adjusted life years and cost-effectiveness using a {UK} Health Service perspective. Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of different time horizons and reduced effectiveness over time from self-management. {RESULTS}: In the long-term, when compared with usual care, self-management was more effective by 0.24 and 0.12 quality adjusted life years ({QALYs}) gained per patient for men and women, respectively. The resultant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for self-management was pound1624 per {QALY} for men and pound4923 per {QALY} for women. There was at least a 99\% chance of the intervention being cost-effective for both sexes at a willingness to pay threshold of pound20,000 per {QALY} gained. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses around the assumptions made, provided that the effects of self-management lasted at least two years for men and five years for women. {CONCLUSION}: Self-monitoring with self-titration of antihypertensives and telemonitoring of blood pressure measurements not only reduces blood pressure, compared with usual care, but also represents a cost-effective use of health care resources.},

	abstract = {Low-dose thiazide-type diuretics are recommended as initial therapy for most hypertensive patients. Chlorthalidone has significantly reduced stroke and cardiovascular end points in several landmark trials; however, hydrochlorothiazide remains favored in practice. Most clinicians assume that the drugs are interchangeable, but their antihypertensive effects at lower doses have not been directly compared. We conducted a randomized, single-blinded, 8-week active treatment, crossover study comparing chlorthalidone 12.5 mg/day (force-titrated to 25 mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day (force-titrated to 50 mg/day) in untreated hypertensive patients. The main outcome, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure ({BP}) monitoring, was assessed at baseline and week 8, along with standard office {BP} readings every 2 weeks. Thirty patients completed the first active treatment period, whereas 24 patients completed both. An order-drug-time interaction was observed with chlorthalidone; therefore, data from only the first active treatment period was considered. Week 8 ambulatory {BPs} indicated a greater reduction from baseline in systolic {BP} with chlorthalidone 25 mg/day compared with hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/day (24-hour mean = -12.4+/-1.8 mm Hg versus -7.4+/-1.7 mm Hg; P=0.054; nighttime mean = -13.5+/-1.9 mm Hg versus -6.4+/-1.8 mm Hg; P=0.009). Office systolic {BP} reduction was lower at week 2 for chlorthalidone 12.5 mg/day versus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day (-15.7+/-2.2 mm Hg versus -4.5+/-2.1 mm Hg; P=0.001); however, by week 8, reductions were statistically similar (-17.1+/-3.7 versus -10.8+/-3.5; P=0.84). Within recommended doses, chlorthalidone is more effective in lowering systolic {BPs} than hydrochlorothiazide, as evidenced by 24-hour ambulatory {BPs}.

All patients had symptoms of New York Heart Association class {IV} heart failure. {RESULTS}: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a reduction of 48 percent in the risk of death from any cause in the group that received left ventricular assist devices as compared with the medical-therapy group (relative risk, 0.52; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.78; P=0.001).

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To determine the validity of the diagnostic algorithms for osteoporosis and fractures in administrative data. {STUDY} {DESIGN} {AND} {SETTING}: A systematic search was conducted to identify studies that reported the validity of a diagnostic algorithm for osteoporosis and/or fractures using administrative data. {RESULTS}: Twelve studies were reviewed. The validity of the diagnosis of osteoporosis in administrative data was fair when at least 3 years of data from hospital and physician visit claims were used (area under the receiver operating characteristic [{ROC}] curve [{AUC}]=0.70) or when pharmacy data were used (with or without the use of hospital and physician visit claims data, {AUC}{\textgreater}0.70). Nonetheless, the positive predictive values ({PPVs}) were low ({\textless}0.60). There was good evidence to support the use of hospital data to identify hip fractures (sensitivity: 69-97\%; {PPV}: 63-96\%) and the addition of physician claims diagnostic and procedural codes to hospitalization diagnostic codes improved these characteristics (sensitivity: 83-97\%; {PPV}: 86-98\%). Vertebral fractures were difficult to identify using administrative data. There was some evidence to support the use of administrative data to define other fractures that do not require hospitalization. {CONCLUSIONS}: Administrative data can be used to identify hip fractures. Existing diagnostic algorithms to identify osteoporosis and vertebral fractures in administrative data are suboptimal.},

	abstract = {It is still uncertain whether one can safely base treatment decisions on self-measurement of blood pressure. In the present study, we investigated whether antihypertensive treatment based on self-measurement of blood pressure leads to the use of less medication without the loss of blood pressure control. We randomly assigned 430 hypertensive patients to receive treatment either on the basis of self-measured pressures (n=216) or office pressures ({OPs}; n=214). During 1-year follow-up, blood pressure was measured by office measurement (10 visits), ambulatory monitoring (start and end), and self-measurement (8 times, self-pressure group only). In addition, drug use, associated costs, and degree of target organ damage (echocardiography and microalbuminuria) were assessed. The self-pressure group used less medication than the {OP} group (1.47 versus 2.48 drug steps; P{\textless}0.001) with lower costs (\$3222 versus \$4420 per 100 patients per month; P{\textless}0.001) but without significant differences in systolic and diastolic {OP} values (1.6/1.0 mm Hg; P=0.25/0.20), in changes in left ventricular mass index (-6.5 g/m(2) versus -5.6 g/m(2); P=0.72), or in median urinary microalbumin concentration (-1.7 versus -1.5 mg per 24 hours; P=0.87). Nevertheless, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure values at the end of the trial were higher in the self-pressure than in the {OP} group: 125.9 versus 123.8 mm Hg (P{\textless}0.05) for systolic and 77.2 versus 76.1 mm Hg (P{\textless}0.05) for diastolic blood pressure. These data show that self-measurement leads to less medication use than office blood pressure measurement without leading to significant differences in {OP} values or target organ damage. Ambulatory values, however, remain slightly elevated for the self-pressure group.},

It is important for a number of reasons, causing impairment of quality of life and, if related to drug therapy, leading to non-compliance. Drug therapy accounts for erectile dysfunction in approximately 25\% of cases and is mostly readily reversible when the offending agent is stopped, or a suitable alternative is substituted. Many classes of drug may be responsible, interfering with the normal physiological processes leading to penile erection in a dose-related fashion, and in ways which can usually be predicted from their pharmacology. The most commonly implicated classes of drug include antihypertensives such as thiazide diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and psychotherapeutic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ({SSRI}) antidepressants. We review the agents which can cause erectile dysfunction, the evidence for this adverse effect and the physiological mechanisms involved. We present an approach to the management of the patient with erectile dysfunction in whom concomitant drug therapy may be responsible. We recommend that drug therapy should always be considered as a possible cause of erectile dysfunction before specific investigation and therapy is considered.},

These categories were used to compare the risk of undergoing hospitalization in the 1 year after the baseline survey and to examine the percentage of inpatient medical expenditure attributable to overall hypertension relative to total medical expenditure in the study population. {RESULTS}: During the follow-up period, 6.6\% of men and 5.1\% of women were hospitalized. In men and women aged 40-54 years, cases of hypertension, especially grade 3 untreated hypertension, led to more frequent hospitalization, compared with optimal blood pressure. Individuals who were hospitalized, especially long-term, incurred considerably higher medical expenditure compared with those who were not hospitalized, regardless of their hypertension status. In women aged 55-69 years, there was little variation in hospitalization risk across blood pressure categories. The inpatient medical expenditure attributable to overall hypertension represented 7.2 and 6.9\% of the total medical expenditure for men aged 40-54 and 55-69 years, whereas it represented 2.8 and 3.8\% for women, respectively. {CONCLUSION}: Although cases of hypertension were an economic burden especially in men, grade 3 untreated hypertension was more likely to incur extremely high medical expenditure as a result of hospitalization, compared with other cases.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Despite treatment, there is often a higher incidence of cardiovascular complications in patients with hypertension than in normotensive individuals. Inadequate reduction of their blood pressure is a likely cause, but the optimum target blood pressure is not known. The impact of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) has never been investigated in patients with hypertension. We aimed to assess the optimum target diastolic blood pressure and the potential benefit of a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid in the treatment of hypertension. {METHODS}: 18790 patients, from 26 countries, aged 50-80 years (mean 61.5 years) with hypertension and diastolic blood pressure between 100 mm Hg and 115 mm Hg (mean 105 mm Hg) were randomly assigned a target diastolic blood pressure. 6264 patients were allocated to the target pressure {\textless} or =90 mm Hg, 6264 to {\textless} or =85 mm Hg, and 6262 to {\textless} or =80 mm Hg. Felodipine was given as baseline therapy with the addition of other agents, according to a five-step regimen. In addition, 9399 patients were randomly assigned 75 mg/day acetylsalicylic acid (Bamycor, Astra) and 9391 patients were assigned placebo. {FINDINGS}: Diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 20.3 mm Hg, 22.3 mm Hg, and 24.3 mm Hg, in the {\textless} or =90 mm Hg, {\textless} or =85 mm Hg, and {\textless} or =80 mm Hg target groups, respectively. The lowest incidence of major cardiovascular events occurred at a mean achieved diastolic blood pressure of 82.6 mm Hg; the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality occurred at 86.5 mm Hg. Further reduction below these blood pressures was safe. In patients with diabetes mellitus there was a 51\% reduction in major cardiovascular events in target group {\textless} or =80 mm Hg compared with target group {\textless} or =90 mm Hg (p for trend=0.005). Acetylsalicylic acid reduced major cardiovascular events by 15\% (p=0.03) and all myocardial infarction by 36\% (p=0.002), with no effect on stroke. There were seven fatal bleeds in the acetylsalicylic acid group and eight in the placebo group, and 129 versus 70 non-fatal major bleeds in the two groups, respectively (p{\textless}0.001). {INTERPRETATION}: Intensive lowering of blood pressure in patients with hypertension was associated with a low rate of cardiovascular events. The {HOT} Study shows the benefits of lowering the diastolic blood pressure down to 82.6 mm Hg. Acetylsalicylic acid significantly reduced major cardiovascular events with the greatest benefit seen in all myocardial infarction. There was no effect on the incidence of stroke or fatal bleeds, but non-fatal major bleeds were twice as common.},

Most patients, however, receive all of their drugs in a single morning dose. We have evaluated the impact on the circadian pattern of blood pressure on modifying the time of treatment without increasing the number of prescribed drugs. We studied 250 hypertensive patients who were receiving 3 antihypertensive drugs in a single morning dose. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to the modification in their treatment strategy: changing 1 of the drugs but keeping all 3 in the morning or the same approach but administering the new drug at bedtime. Blood pressure was measured for 48 hours before and after 12 weeks of treatment. There was no effect on ambulatory blood pressure when all of the drugs were taken on awakening. The baseline prevalence of nondipping (79\%) was slightly increased after treatment (86\%; P=0.131). The ambulatory blood pressure reduction was statistically significant (9.4/6.0 mm Hg for systolic/diastolic blood pressure; P{\textless}0.001) with 1 drug at bedtime. This reduction was larger in the nocturnal than in the diurnal mean of blood pressure. Thus, whereas only 16\% of the patients in this group were dippers at baseline, 57\% were dippers after therapy (P{\textless}0.001). Results indicate that, in resistant hypertension, time of treatment may be more important for blood pressure control and for the proper modeling of the circadian blood pressure pattern than just changing the drug combination.},

References from publications reviewed were included. {STUDY} {SELECTION} {AND} {DATA} {EXTRACTION}: English-language articles identified were reviewed. Animal studies and studies in patients for a primary diagnosis of coronary artery disease were excluded. {DATA} {SYNTHESIS}: beta-Blockers are no longer recommended first-line therapy for primary hypertension, based on data showing that beta-blockers are inferior to other antihypertensives and no better than placebo, in spite of provision of blood pressure reduction. Because atenolol is the beta-blocker used in 75\% of these studies, uncertainty about widespread application to all beta-blockers exists. Different pharmacological and physiological properties, both within beta-blockers and compared with other antihypertensives, may explain divergent effects. Evidence shows that beta-blockers have a truncated effect on central aortic pressure, an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, compared with other antihypertensive classes; differences within the class may exist, but the evidence is inconclusive. Metabolic effects differ within the beta-blocker class, with evidence that carvedilol causes less metabolic dysregulation. {CONCLUSION}: Emerging evidence reveals physiological differences within the beta-blocker class and in comparison to other antihypertensives. These differences provide insight into the diverse clinical effects beta-blockers provide in cardiovascular disease.},

The hyponatremia developed within 14 days in most of the patients receiving thiazides but in none of the patients who were treated with furosemide. Diuretic-induced hyponatremia was four times more common in women than in men. Advanced age was not associated with a higher tendency for hyponatremia. In the majority of the patients who received thiazides, excess antidiuretic hormone activity, hypokalemia, and excess water intake were accompanying findings which, singly or together, appeared to contribute to the development of hyponatremia. In 12 patients, mortality was directly related to hyponatremia. Rapid average correction of hyponatremia and a relatively high total correction (over 20 {mEq}/L) in the first 24 h were significantly associated with higher mortality or demyelinating syndrome. The presence of neurologic signs is an indication for active sodium replacement. The onset of thiazide-induced hyponatremia may in some cases occur within 1 day and therefore needs to be corrected rapidly, but within a total elevation of 20 {mEq}/L in the first 24 h. Where the onset is judged to have been slow (over several days), the level should be corrected at a slow rate, up to a total of 12 to 15 {mEq}/L in 24 h.},

Better hypertension control reflected increased percentages of older (55.6\% to 77.5\%) and younger (34.6\% to 54.7\%) patients on treatment and treated older (45.7\% to 64.9\%) and younger (56.8\% to 73.4\%) patients controlled (all P{\textless}0.001). Control to {\textless}150/{\textless}90 mm Hg rose from 48.8\% to 69.9\% in older adults. Antihypertensive medication number and percentages on {\textgreater}/=3 medications increased in both age groups but increased more in older patients (P{\textless}0.01). Blood pressure control was higher in both age groups with {\textgreater}/=2 healthcare visits per year and on statin therapy. {CONCLUSIONS}: The age gap in hypertension control to {\textless}140/{\textless}90 mm Hg was virtually eliminated in 2005 to 2010 as clinicians intensified therapy, especially in older patients in whom isolated systolic hypertension predominates, controlling 70\% to {\textless}150/{\textless}90 mm Hg. More frequent healthcare visits and the use of statin therapy may improve hypertension control in all adults.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A number of studies have computed the minimally important difference ({MID}) for health-related quality of life instruments. {OBJECTIVE}: To determine whether there is consistency in the magnitude of {MID} estimates from different instruments. {METHODS}: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify studies that computed an {MID} and contained sufficient information to compute an effect size ({ES}). Thirty-eight studies fulfilled the criteria, resulting in 62 {ESs}. {RESULTS}: For all but 6 studies, the {MID} estimates were close to one half a {SD} (mean = 0.495, {SD} = 0.155). There was no consistent relationship with factors such as disease-specific or generic instrument or the number of response options. Negative changes were not associated with larger {ESs}. Population-based estimation procedures and brief follow-up were associated with smaller {ESs}, and acute conditions with larger {ESs}. An explanation for this consistency is that research in psychology has shown that the limit of people's ability to discriminate over a wide range of tasks is approximately 1 part in 7, which is very close to half a {SD}. {CONCLUSION}: In most circumstances, the threshold of discrimination for changes in health-related quality of life for chronic diseases appears to be approximately half a {SD}.},

The results showed that those with hypertension scored lower in the linear regression analyses in most of the eight domains of the {SF}-36 than those without hypertension after controlling for age, sex, sociodemographic factors, and comorbidity. Diabetes and angina pectoris were related to lower scores in most of the domains of the {SF}-36. Previous myocardial infarction was associated with lower general health and vitality. Those with a previous stroke had lower scores in physical functioning, general health, vitality, and social functioning. The findings suggest that hypertensives represent a vulnerable population that merits special attention from health care providers and systems.

Pharmacists who were identified by the residency directors were invited to participate in the Web-based survey. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The percentage of training sites for family medicine residency that have pharmacists directly involved in teaching residents. The types and the extent of teaching performed by the pharmacists who teach in the residency programs. The primary source of funding that supports the pharmacists' salaries. {RESULTS}: More than a quarter (25.3\%) of family medicine residency training sites include direct involvement of pharmacist teachers. Pharmacist teachers reported that they spend a substantial amount of their time teaching residents using a range of teaching modalities and topics, but have no formal pharmacotherapy curriculums. Nearly a quarter (22.6\%) of the pharmacists reported that their salaries were primarily funded by the residency programs. {CONCLUSION}: Pharmacists have a role in training family medicine residents. This is a good opportunity for family medicine residents to learn about issues related to pharmacotherapy; however, the role of pharmacists as educators might be optimized if standardized teaching methods, curriculums, and evaluation plans were in place.},

This substudy analyses the sex difference in cardiovascular disease risk reduction in the Jikei Heart Study. {METHODS}: Treatment effects were evaluated by sex (1038 women and 2043 men) as hazard ratios with 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}) using Cox regression models adjusted for age, {BMI}, smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes, antihypertensives, and statin use at baseline. {RESULTS}: Women were older, had higher {SBP}, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but were less frequently smokers or diabetics, and had a lower {DBP} and incidence of coronary artery disease. A greater incidence of primary endpoint, a composite of cardiovascular events, occurred in men versus women [hazard ratio 1.37 (95\% {CI} 1.02-1.85)]. Men in the valsartan group had a significant reduction in the primary endpoint [hazard ratio 0.6 (95\% {CI} 0.44-0.82), P = 0.001], whereas a nonsignificant effect was found in women [hazard ratio 0.64 (95\% {CI} 0.39-1.06), P = 0.075]. However, statistical heterogeneity of this valsartan effect was not found between sexes, and women of at least 55 years of age, mostly after menopause, in the valsartan group showed a significant risk reduction for the primary endpoint [hazard ratio 0.60 (95\% {CI} 0.36-0.99)]. {CONCLUSION}: The valsartan effect was significant in men and in elderly women but consistent in both sexes. A potential cardiovascular protection by valsartan therapy might be attributed to the cardiovascular risk level but not to the sex difference.},

The cost evaluation method used was based on costing technique by production function and consensus techniques. To estimate the epidemiologic changes and financial consequences for the period 2005 to 2007, three probabilistic models were constructed according to the Box-Jenkins technique. {RESULTS}: If changes are not implemented in prevention programs to reduce the effects of current risk factors, there will be increases in the number of patients with hypertension as well as in the financial burden to treat the disease. The amount allocated for hypertension in 2007, which will be 6\% to 8\% of the total health budget, is {US}\$ 2,486,145,132. Of these, {US}\$ 1,178,725,132 will be direct costs and {US}\$ 1,307,420,000 will be indirect costs. Regarding epidemiologic changes for 2005 v 2007 (P {\textless} .05), an increase is expected, although results show a greater increase in insured populations. {CONCLUSIONS}: If the risk factors and different health programs remain as they currently are, the economic impact of expected epidemiologic changes on the social security system will be particularly strong. Another relevant financial factor is the appearance of internal competition in the allocation of financial resources among the main providers of health services for hypertension; this factor becomes even more complicated within each provider.},

Furthermore, the number of patients with resistant hypertension continues to increase. For patients with resistant hypertension, the American Heart Association has advocated for clinical studies to determine appropriate pharmacologic treatment strategies. One proposed strategy involves ambulatory measurement of plasma renin activity ({PRA}) to guide the selection of antihypertensive therapy. Patients with low {PRA} would be prescribed natriuretic volume-mediated therapies (e.g., diuretics and calcium channel blockers), whereas those with high {PRA} would receive antirenin system therapies (e.g., β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin {II} receptor blockers). This review focuses on the principles of {PRA}-guided therapy, its historical development, alternative approaches to classifying patients into categories of response to antihypertensive agents, and recent data supporting the use of plasma renin activity-guided hypertension management.},

But {SES} has several components, including income and correlations in cross-sectional data need not imply {SES} is a risk factor. This study investigates whether wages-the largest category within income-are risk factors. {METHODS}: We analysed longitudinal, nationally representative {US} data from four waves (1999, 2001, 2003 and 2005) of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The overall sample was restricted to employed persons age 25-65 years, n = 17 295. Separate subsamples were constructed of persons within two age groups (25-44 and 45-65 years) and genders. Hypertension incidence was self-reported based on physician diagnosis. Our study was prospective since data from three base years (1999, 2001, 2003) were used to predict newly diagnosed hypertension for three subsequent years (2001, 2003, 2005). In separate analyses, data from the first base year were used to predict time-to-reporting hypertension. Logistic regressions with random effects and Cox proportional hazards regressions were run. {RESULTS}: Negative and strongly statistically significant correlations between wages and hypertension were found both in logistic and Cox regressions, especially for subsamples containing the younger age group (25-44 years) and women. Correlations were stronger when three health variables-obesity, subjective measures of health and number of co-morbidities-were excluded from regressions. Doubling the wage was associated with 25-30\% lower chances of hypertension for persons aged 25-44 years. {CONCLUSIONS}: The strongest evidence for low wages being risk factors for hypertension among working people were for women and persons aged 25-44 years.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Angioedema is a rare but potentially serious adverse event of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. However, no prospective, controlled studies have reported on its incidence and clinical characteristics. {METHODS}: We studied the occurrence of angioedema in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of 12 557 persons with hypertension treated with enalapril maleate, 5 to 40 mg/d, using a prospective ascertainment and adjudication of angioedema by an expert committee. {RESULTS}: Angioedema occurred in 86 (0.68\%) of the subjects. Stepwise logistic regression identified black race (odds ratio [{OR}], 2.88; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.72-4.82), history of drug rash ({OR}, 3.78; 95\% {CI}, 1.80-7.92), age greater than 65 years ({OR}, 1.60; 95\% {CI}, 1.02-2.53), and seasonal allergies ({OR}, 1.79; 95\% {CI}, 1.06-3.00) as independent risk factors for angioedema. The incidence of angioedema was higher after initiation of therapy (3.6/1000 patients per month) and declined to 0.4/1000 patients per month. Treatment was not given in 44 (51\%) of the cases; antihistamines were administered in 35 (41\%); corticosteroids, in 20 (23\%); and epinephrine, in 1 (1\%). Two patients were hospitalized but none had airway compromise. {CONCLUSIONS}: Enalapril-related angioedema is uncommon. Although it is most likely to occur early after initiation of therapy, it may occur at any time. It is more likely to occur in black patients, those older than 65 years, and those with a history of drug rash or seasonal allergies.

This retrospective analysis aims to characterize these patients with refractory hypertension. Refractory hypertension was defined as {BP} that remained uncontrolled after {\textgreater}/=3 visits to a hypertension clinic within a minimum 6-month follow-up period. Of the 304 patients referred for {RHTN}, 29 (9.5\%) remained refractory to treatment. Patients with refractory hypertension and those with controlled {RHTN} had similar aldosterone levels and plasma renin activity ({PRA}). Patients with refractory hypertension had higher baseline {BP} (175+/-23/97+/-15 mm Hg vs 158+/-25/89+/-15 mm Hg; P=.001/.005) and heart rate, and higher rates of prior stroke and congestive heart failure. During follow-up, the {BP} of patients with refractory hypertension remained uncontrolled (168.4+/-14.8/93.8+/-17.7 mm Hg) in spite of use of an average of 6 antihypertensive medications, while those of patients with controlled {RHTN} decreased to 129.3+/-11.2/77.6+/-10.8 mm Hg. Spironolactone reduced the {BP} by 12.9+/-17.8/6.6+/-13.7 mm Hg in patients with refractory hypertension and by 24.1+/-16.7/9.2+/-12.0 mm Hg in patients with controlled {RHTN}. In patients with {RHTN}, approximately 10\% remain refractory to treatment. Similar aldosterone and {PRA} levels and a diminished response to spironolactone suggest that aldosterone excess does not explain the treatment failure.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To evaluate the impact of dosage frequency on the compliance of patients who receive their medicines from community pharmacies. {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: Each month, patients received a supply of their medication in a Medication Event Monitoring Systems container, which registered each opening of the package. At the end of the study, the patients received a short questionnaire. The subjects were 91 diabetic patients using oral antidiabetic agents. Patients taking insulin and those who were unable to collect their medicines from the pharmacy were excluded from the study. Compliance was defined as the percentage of doses taken during the observation period. Another parameter used was compliance with the prescribed regimen, defined as the percentage of days in which the number of tablets were taken as prescribed. As a last parameter, compliance with the prescribed dose intervals was used. {RESULTS}: Compliance is influenced by the frequency of doses. The compliance for this group of patients is 74.8\%, with an average of 79\% in the case of a dose once daily and 38\% in the case of a dose three times daily. The predominant type of noncompliance in all groups was dose omissions. However, more than one-third of the patients used more doses than prescribed. Overconsumption is a frequently made mistake by patients on a one-dose daily schedule. {CONCLUSIONS}: The reduction of dose frequency may decrease total noncompliance, but at the same time, it increases the risk of overconsumption. Reducing the frequency does not automatically result in a better therapeutic schedule. The choice of once or twice daily should depend on the therapeutic range of the drug.},

For each patient who could be interviewed, pharmacy master students used a structured questionnaire to gather relevant, mandatory patient data (ie, basic characteristics, current drugs used, diseases, intolerabilities, specific conditions) and nonmandatory patient data (eg, diagnostic and monitoring data, personal experiences and habits, drug use problems) from the patient's {EPR} and from a structured telephone interview with the patient. Data retrieved from the patient's {EPR} were compared with data provided by the patient during the telephone interview. {RESULTS}: Of 403 selected patients, 154 (38.2\%) could be interviewed by telephone. Poor documentation of telephone numbers in the {EPR} was the main reason for nonresponse (134/249). Interviewers found that 67.7\% of prescription drugs, 0\% of over-the-counter drugs, 19.6\% of diseases, 3.7\% of intolerabilities, and none of the specific conditions reported by patients had been documented in the {EPR}. Nonmandatory data (personal experiences and habits, drug use problems) reported during the patient interview had not been documented in the {EPR}. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {EPR} after a patient's first visit to the community pharmacy is often incomplete. For new patients, the pharmacist should more proactively and systematically gather patient information, and all relevant information should be recorded, preferably in coded form, in the pharmacy information system to allow more adequate clinical risk management.},

Prior cohorts either excluded or had limited representation of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ({HFpEF}). We aimed to examine the relationship between calculated plasma volume status ({PVS}) and outcomes in {HFpEF}. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We included enrollees from the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial ({TOPCAT}) with available haematocrit and weight data (n = 3414). Plasma volume was derived from the Hakim formula and compared to estimates of ideal plasma volume to generate a relative {PVS}. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models tested the association of {PVS} with clinical outcomes. The median {PVS} was -11.9\% (25th-75th percentile: -17.2\% to -6.4\%) and the majority (91.1\%) had {PVS} consistent with relative volume contraction ({PVS} {\textless}/= 0\%) as opposed to volume expansion (8.9\%, {PVS} {\textgreater} 0\%). After multivariable adjustment, each 5\% increment in {PVS} was associated with a approximately 11\%, 14\%, and 12\% higher risk for the primary composite endpoint, all-cause death, and heart failure hospitalization, respectively (P {\textless} 0.002 for all), but not cardiovascular death (P = 0.051). After additional adjustment for natriuretic peptides, {PVS} only remained associated with heart failure hospitalization ({HR} 1.10, 95\% confidence interval 1.001-1.21, P = 0.047). There were no significant interactions between spironolactone use and the {PVS}-risk relationship for any endpoint (P {\textgreater} 0.1 for all). {CONCLUSION}: Higher calculated estimates of {PVS} were independently associated with a higher risk of long-term clinical outcomes in {HFpEF}, and particularly, heart failure hospitalization.},

	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE}: Mutations in {SNCA}, {LRRK}2, {VPS}35, {EIF}4G1, and {DNAJC}13 have been implicated in late-onset familial parkinsonism. However, the estimated disease penetrance of these mutations varies widely. {OBJECTIVE}: To compare penetrance of various mutations reported in published genetic studies to improve the understanding of late-onset parkinsonism. {DATA} {SOURCES}: Forty-nine previously published studies, including 709 participants, were included for all original and subsequent articles in {ISI} Web of Science, {PubMed} electronic databases, and extracted information about number of mutation carriers within families and sporadic cases worldwide for pathogenic mutations in {SNCA}, {LRRK}2, {VPS}35, {EIF}4G1, and {DNAJC}13. The end-of-search date was January 31, 2014. {STUDY} {SELECTION}: Published studies were included if there was information on the ethnicity of the patient or unaffected individual, confirmation of mutation, age of patient or unaffected individual, age at onset, and first motor symptom of patient. Autosomal recessive parkinsonism and genes implicated without significant genetic linkage were excluded from this study. {DATA} {EXTRACTION} {AND} {SYNTHESIS}: The age-associated cumulative incidence was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with age at onset as the time variable; asymptomatic carriers were right censored at the age at last contact or age at death. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: Comparative measures were obtained with log-rank tests, and each penetrance estimate was given separately with 95\% confidence intervals. {RESULTS}: All the assessed autosomal dominant Parkinson disease mutations have significantly different age-dependent cumulative incidences (P {\textless} .001). In particular, penetrance of {SNCA} duplications was comparable to point mutations (log-rank P = .97) and driven by inclusion of {SNCA} p.A53T (mean age at onset, 45.9 years; 95\% {CI}, 43-49 years). In addition, Israeli Ashkenazi Jewish {LRRK}2 p.G2019S carriers (mean age at onset, 57.9 years; 95\% {CI}, 54-63 years) were comparable to Tunisian Arab Berbers (mean age at onset, 57.1 years; 95\% {CI}, 45.5-68.7 years) (P = .58), whereas Norwegian carriers (mean age at onset, 63 years; 95\% {CI}, 51.4-74.6 years) were significantly different from the other groups (P {\textless} .001). {CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: Parkinson disease pathogenic mutations have an age-dependent penetrance that could be ameliorated or exacerbated by modifier genes or environmental factors in different populations.},

We process the text from the {EMRs} to capture different diseases, symptoms and treatments by means of noun phrases and ontologies. We also capture the global context of each text entry using Statistical Topic Models. We fill out the missing values using a Expectation Maximization based method ({EM}). Experimental results show that our method outperforms other methods in the literature terms of {AUC}, sensitivity and specificity. In addition, we show that the combination of different features (numerical and text) increases the prediction performance of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Despite previous randomised trials of early beta-blocker therapy in the emergency treatment of myocardial infarction ({MI}), uncertainty has persisted about the value of adding it to current standard interventions (eg, aspirin and fibrinolytic therapy), and the balance of potential benefits and hazards is still unclear in high-risk patients. {METHODS}: 45,852 patients admitted to 1250 hospitals within 24 h of suspected acute {MI} onset were randomly allocated metoprolol (up to 15 mg intravenous then 200 mg oral daily; n=22,929) or matching placebo (n=22,923). 93\% had {ST}-segment elevation or bundle branch block, and 7\% had {ST}-segment depression. Treatment was to continue until discharge or up to 4 weeks in hospital (mean 15 days in survivors) and 89\% completed it. The two prespecified co-primary outcomes were: (1) composite of death, reinfarction, or cardiac arrest; and (2) death from any cause during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons were by intention to treat, and used the log-rank method. This study is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT} 00222573. {FINDINGS}: Neither of the co-primary outcomes was significantly reduced by allocation to metoprolol. For death, reinfarction, or cardiac arrest, 2166 (9.4\%) patients allocated metoprolol had at least one such event compared with 2261 (9.9\%) allocated placebo (odds ratio [{OR}] 0.96, 95\% {CI} 0.90-1.01; p=0.1). For death alone, there were 1774 (7.7\%) deaths in the metoprolol group versus 1797 (7.8\%) in the placebo group ({OR} 0.99, 0.92-1.05; p=0.69). Allocation to metoprolol was associated with five fewer people having reinfarction (464 [2.0\%] metoprolol vs 568 [2.5\%] placebo; {OR} 0.82, 0.72-0.92; p=0.001) and five fewer having ventricular fibrillation (581 [2.5\%] vs 698 [3.0\%]; {OR} 0.83, 0.75-0.93; p=0.001) per 1000 treated. Overall, these reductions were counterbalanced by 11 more per 1000 developing cardiogenic shock (1141 [5.0\%] vs 885 [3.9\%]; {OR} 1.30, 1.19-1.41; p{\textless}0.00001). This excess of cardiogenic shock was mainly during days 0-1 after admission, whereas the reductions in reinfarction and ventricular fibrillation emerged more gradually. Consequently, the overall effect on death, reinfarction, arrest, or shock was significantly adverse during days 0-1 and significantly beneficial thereafter. There was substantial net hazard in haemodynamically unstable patients, and moderate net benefit in those who were relatively stable (particularly after days 0-1). {INTERPRETATION}: The use of early beta-blocker therapy in acute {MI} reduces the risks of reinfarction and ventricular fibrillation, but increases the risk of cardiogenic shock, especially during the first day or so after admission. Consequently, it might generally be prudent to consider starting beta-blocker therapy in hospital only when the haemodynamic condition after {MI} has stabilised.},

	abstract = {Hypertension is an important and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Over the last decade, national-levels of controlled hypertension have increased, but little information on hypertension prevalence and trends in hypertension treatment and control exists at the county-level. We estimate trends in prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in {US} counties using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES}) in five two-year waves from 1999-2008 including 26,349 adults aged 30 years and older and from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ({BRFSS}) from 1997-2009 including 1,283,722 adults aged 30 years and older. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ({BP}) of at least 140 mm Hg, self-reported use of antihypertensive treatment, or both. Hypertension control was defined as systolic {BP} less than 140 mm Hg. The median prevalence of total hypertension in 2009 was estimated at 37.6\% (range: 26.5 to 54.4\%) in men and 40.1\% (range: 28.5 to 57.9\%) in women. Within-state differences in the county prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension were as high as 7.8 percentage points in 2009. Awareness, treatment, and control was highest in the southeastern {US}, and increased between 2001 and 2009 on average. The median county-level control in men was 57.7\% (range: 43.4 to 65.9\%) and in women was 57.1\% (range: 43.0 to 65.46\%) in 2009, with highest rates in white men and black women. While control of hypertension is on the rise, prevalence of total hypertension continues to increase in the {US}. Concurrent increases in treatment and control of hypertension are promising, but efforts to decrease the prevalence of hypertension are needed.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many cardiovascular epidemiologic studies rely on diagnosis codes in health care claims databases. Despite important changes in the care and diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction ({AMI}), the validity of hospital discharge diagnosis codes for {AMI} in the {US} Medicare system has not been recently examined. Our objective was to examine the accuracy of International Classification of Diseases--ninth revision--Clinical Modifications ({ICD}-9-{CM}) discharge diagnosis codes and diagnosis-related groups ({DRG}) codes for {AMI} in a Medicare claims database. {METHODS}: We sampled hospitalization episodes from Medicare beneficiaries in Pennsylvania during 1999, 2000, or both. We used Medicare data to identify patients with hospitalizations containing indicators of {AMI} ({ICD}-9-{CM} diagnosis codes 410.X0 and 410.X1 or {DRG} codes 121, 122, and 123). Hospital records for these episodes were reviewed by trained abstractors using World Health Organization criteria for diagnosing {AMI}. We then calculated the positive predictive value of Medicare claims-based definitions of {AMI}. {RESULTS}: Of 2200 hospitalization episodes with Medicare diagnosis codes suggestive of {AMI}, 2022 hospital records (91.9\%) were obtained. The positive predictive value for a primary Medicare claims-based definition was 94.1\% (95\% {CI}, 93.0\%-95.2\%). Positive predictive values for alternative claims-based definitions ranged slightly, with the definition including {DRG} codes and length-of-stay restrictions yielding the highest positive predictive value, 95.4\% (95\% {CI}, 94.3\%-96.4\%). Subjects with a history of myocardial infarction had a significantly lower positive predictive value than subjects without a history of myocardial infarction (88.1\% vs 94.6\%, P {\textless}.001). {CONCLUSIONS}: In this study, we observed high positive predictive values for a Medicare claims-based diagnosis of {AMI} and a diagnosis based on structured hospital record review.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Lowering of blood pressure prevents stroke but optimum target levels to prevent recurrent stroke are unknown. We investigated the effects of different blood-pressure targets on the rate of recurrent stroke in patients with recent lacunar stroke. {METHODS}: In this randomised open-label trial, eligible patients lived in North America, Latin America, and Spain and had recent, {MRI}-defined symptomatic lacunar infarctions. Patients were recruited between March, 2003, and April, 2011, and randomly assigned, according to a two-by-two multifactorial design, to a systolic-blood-pressure target of 130-149 mm Hg or less than 130 mm Hg. The primary endpoint was reduction in all stroke (including ischaemic strokes and intracranial haemorrhages). Analysis was done by intention to treat. This study is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT} 00059306. {FINDINGS}: 3020 enrolled patients, 1519 in the higher-target group and 1501 in the lower-target group, were followed up for a mean of 3.7 ({SD} 2.0) years. Mean age was 63 ({SD} 11) years. After 1 year, mean systolic blood pressure was 138 mm Hg (95\% {CI} 137-139) in the higher-target group and 127 mm Hg (95\% {CI} 126-128) in the lower-target group. Non-significant rate reductions were seen for all stroke (hazard ratio 0.81, 95\% {CI} 0.64-1.03, p=0.08), disabling or fatal stroke (0.81, 0.53-1.23, p=0.32), and the composite outcome of myocardial infarction or vascular death (0.84, 0.68-1.04, p=0.32) with the lower target. The rate of intracerebral haemorrhage was reduced significantly (0.37, 0.15-0.95, p=0.03). Treatment-related serious adverse events were infrequent. {INTERPRETATION}: Although the reduction in stroke was not significant, our results support that in patients with recent lacunar stroke, the use of a systolic-blood-pressure target of less than 130 mm Hg is likely to be beneficial. {FUNDING}: National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ({NIH}-{NINDS}).},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Effective treatment of uncontrolled hypertension using catheter-based percutaneous renal denervation may depend strongly on the anatomic strategy applied when delivering therapy. We hypothesized that concentering renal denervation treatment in the distal region of the artery would improve clinical response. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We conducted a single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled, and parallel group study ({ClinicalTrials}.gov {NCT}02667912). Fifty-one treatment-resistant hypertensive patients meeting guideline indications were randomized either to 'conventional' treatment restricted to the main renal artery (n = 26) or to 'distal' treatment applied mainly in the distal branches beyond the main bifurcation (n = 25). Computer-based treatment assignment was performed in the catheterization laboratory at the time of the procedure by the interventional radiologist and remained unknown to patients, investigators, and other outcomes assessors for the entire study period. Six months after randomization, the distal therapy group (n = 24) had a significantly greater decrease in the primary outcome, 24-h mean ambulatory {SBP}, as compared with the conventionally treated group (n = 21): -22.6 +/- 20.0 vs -9.4 +/- 18.7 {mmHg}; P less than 0.05. No major safety issues were observed in either group. {CONCLUSION}: Percutaneous renal denervation treatment was significantly less effective at lowering 24-h blood pressure in treatment-resistant hypertensive patients when therapy was applied conventionally in the trunk of renal artery as compared with when applied to distal segmental branches. This observation is in accordance with previous surgical and anatomical findings showing that most renal nerve fibers are distant from the lumen proximally and become available for endovascular treatment mainly in the distal portion of the vessel.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To estimate the potential effect on cardiovascular event occurrence and treatment costs associated with increases in systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) among patients with osteoarthritis ({OA}) and rheumatoid arthritis ({RA}). {METHODS}: We used cardiovascular risk prediction models from the Framingham Heart Study and data on risk factors from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES} {III}) to estimate occurrences of ischemic heart disease and stroke over one year among {US} adults with {OA}/{RA}. Separate analyses were conducted for treated hypertensive patients, and untreated hypertensive and normotensive patients, respectively. Published estimates were used to assign costs to these events and to follow care. The effect of incremental increases in {SBP} on events and costs was then assessed. Monte Carlo simulation was undertaken to assess the range of event occurrence and costs associated with alternative assumptions regarding the distribution of increased {SBP} in the at-risk population. {RESULTS}: Of the estimated 30 million adults in the {US} aged {\textgreater} or = 35 years with {OA} and {RA}, roughly 11.8 million (39\%) receive pharmacologic treatment for hypertension. Increases in {SBP} of 1-5 mm Hg were associated with 7,100-35,700 additional ischemic heart disease and stroke events over one year, with corresponding costs (year 2000 {USD}) of 114-569 million year 2000 {USD}. A 20 mm Hg increase in {SBP} experienced by 15\% of the at-risk population (equivalent to a population-average 3 mm Hg increase) is associated with about 21,700 additional events (95\% {CI} 19,120, 24,221) and 346 million year 2000 {USD} (95\% {CI} 305 year 2000 {USD}, 387 million) in associated costs. {CONCLUSION}: Relatively small changes in {SBP} associated with use of common arthritis medications can have a significant effect on the cardiovascular risk profile. It is important that clinicians who treat patients with {OA}/{RA} accurately weigh the potential risks of these medications against their benefits.},

Factors associated with pump use, glycosylated hemoglobin ({HbA}1c), and hypoglycemia were analyzed by regression. {RESULTS}: The 305 participants had a median age of 65 [interquartile range, 59, 71] years, median diabetes duration of 54 [51, 59] years, and mean {HbA}1c level of 7.5 +/- 1.1\%. Prevalence of pump use was 44\% (133/305), with median duration of use 8 [4, 13] years. Compared with the non-pump subgroup, the pump subgroup had numerically lower but similar {HbA}1c levels (7.4 +/- 0.9\% vs. 7.6 +/- 1.2\%; P = 0.22) and reported greater numbers of minor hypoglycemia events (6.5 vs. 5.1 events/patient.month; P = 0.004) and fewer severe hypoglycemia events (0.5 vs. 1.3 events/patient.year; P = 0.02) in the past year. More frequent daily glucose tests and more frequent minor hypoglycemia events-but not pump therapy or its prescription parameters-were independently associated with lower {HbA}1c level in multivariable regression. However, use of insulin pump and habitual use of continuous glucose monitoring ({\textgreater}/=1 week/month) were each independently associated with lower risk of severe hypoglycemia (risk ratio = 0.50 [P {\textless} 0.0001] and 0.30 [P = 0.001], respectively). {CONCLUSIONS}: Insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring technologies were associated with lower risk of severe hypoglycemia, while frequent daily glucose testing was associated with lower {HbA}1c level.

However, several studies in hypertensive patients receiving treatment have described this relationship as J-shaped, with an increased risk for events in patients with low blood pressure. {OBJECTIVE}: To assess the evidence for a J-shaped relationship between blood pressure and mortality and its relation to treatment. {DESIGN}: Meta-analysis of individual-patient data. {SETTING}: Seven randomized clinical trials from the {INDANA} ({INdividual} Data {ANalysis} of Antihypertensive intervention) database. {PATIENTS}: 40 233 persons with hypertension (mean follow-up, 3.9 years). {INTERVENTION}: Primarily beta-blockers or thiazide diuretics versus placebo or no treatment. {MEASUREMENTS}: Diastolic and systolic blood pressure and number of cardiovascular, noncardiovascular, and all-cause deaths in yearly periods of follow-up. {RESULTS}: The analysis included data on 1655 deaths (56\% cardiovascular). A J-shaped relationship between diastolic blood pressure and risk for death was observed for total and cardiovascular mortality in treated patients (nadir, 84 and 80 mm Hg, respectively) and untreated patients (nadir, 90 and 85 mm Hg, respectively). For noncardiovascular deaths, the relationship was J-shaped in the treated group (nadir, 84 mm Hg) and negative in the control group. Similar results were observed for systolic blood pressure. The presence of patients with wide pulse pressure did not explain these findings. {CONCLUSIONS}: The increased risk for events observed in patients with low blood pressure was not related to antihypertensive treatment and was not specific to blood pressure-related events. Poor health conditions leading to low blood pressure and an increased risk for death probably explain the J-shaped curve.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with an elevated risk of all cardiovascular disease, especially stroke. However, many patients with hypertension do not achieve agreed targets for blood pressure. {OBJECTIVE}: To estimate the cost and morbidity consequences of uncontrolled hypertension in the {UK}. {DESIGN}: Descriptive epidemiological study. {METHODS}: The study used a burden-of-disease model combining data on the prevalence of hypertension, the incidence of major cardiovascular ({CV}) events and the costs of treating these events. The prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension was taken from the 1998 Health Survey for England. The incidences of three {CV} events, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and stroke, at different levels of achieved blood pressure, were estimated using results from the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study. Costs were taken from published sources. We estimated the number of major {CV} events and acute hospital costs that would be avoided if all people with hypertension had blood pressure treated to target levels. {RESULTS}: The model estimated that in the {UK} 5.7 million adults (12\% of the population aged {\textgreater}16 years) have actual blood pressure above 160/95 mm Hg, and a further 10.3 million (21\%) have blood pressure in the range 140/90-160/95 mm Hg. An estimated 58000 major {CV} events per year occur in these patients that would be avoided if their blood pressure was at target levels. If all patients had blood pressure treated to target, the cost to the {NHS} of managing major {CV} events would fall by pound 97.2 million per year at 2000/01 prices (95\% {CI}: pound 56- pound 144 million). {CONCLUSION}: Failure to achieve blood pressure targets contributes substantially to avoidable {NHS} costs and to the number of {CV} events in the {UK}.},

	abstract = {Treatment-resistant hypertension ({TRH}) affects between 3 and 30\% of hypertensive patients, and its presence is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Until recently, the interest on these patients has been limited, because providing care for them is difficult and often frustrating. However, the arrival of new treatment options [i.e. catheter-based renal denervation ({RDN}) and baroreceptor stimulation] has revitalized the interest in this topic. The very promising results of the initial uncontrolled studies on the blood pressure ({BP})-lowering effect of {RDN} in {TRH} seemed to suggest that this intervention might represent an easy solution for a complex problem. However, subsequently, data from controlled studies have tempered the enthusiasm of the medical community (and the industry). Conversely, these new studies emphasized some seminal aspects on this topic: (i) the key role of 24 h ambulatory {BP} and arterial stiffness measurement to identify 'true' resistant patients; (ii) the high prevalence of secondary hypertension among this population; and (iii) the difficulty to identify those patients who may profit from device-based interventions. Accordingly, for those patients with documented {TRH}, the guidelines suggest to refer them to a hypertension specialist/centre in order to perform adequate work-up and treatment strategies. The aim of this review is to provide guidance for the cardiologist on how to identify patients with {TRH} and elucidate the prevailing underlying pathophysiological mechanism(s), to define a strategy for the identification of patients with {TRH} who may benefit from device-based interventions and discuss results and limitations of these interventions, and finally to briefly summarize the different drug-based treatment strategies.},

At each examination, we estimated the population attributable risks ({PAR}) of traditional risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking) for the 10-year incidence of {CVD}. Overall, the {PAR} of all risk factors combined appeared to decrease from the late 1980s to the late 1990s (0.58 to 0.53). The combined {PAR} was higher in women than men in 1987 through 1989 (0.68 versus 0.51, P{\textless}0.001) but not by the late 1990s (0.58 versus 0.48, P=0.08). The combined {PAR} was higher in blacks than whites in the late 1980s (0.67 versus 0.57, P=0.049), and this difference was more pronounced by the late 1990s (0.67 versus 0.48, P=0.002). By the late 1990s, the {PAR} of hypertension had become higher in women than men (P=0.02) and also appeared higher in blacks than whites (P=0.08). By the late 1990s, the {PAR} of diabetes mellitus remained higher in women than men (P{\textless}0.0001) and in blacks than whites (P{\textless}0.0001). {CONCLUSIONS}: The contribution to {CVD} of all traditional risk factors combined is greater in blacks than whites, and this difference may be increasing. The contributions of hypertension and diabetes mellitus remain especially high, in women as well as blacks. These findings underscore the continued need for individual as well as population approaches to {CVD} risk factor modification.},

	abstract = {Correlation between blood pressure ({BP}) and target organ damage, vascular risk and long-term patient prognosis is greater for measurements derived from around-the-clock ambulatory {BP} monitoring than in-clinic daytime ones. Numerous studies consistently substantiate the asleep {BP} mean is both an independent and a much better predictor of cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) risk than either the awake or 24 h means. Sleep-time hypertension is much more prevalent than suspected, not only in patients with sleep disorders, but also among those who are elderly or have type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease or resistant hypertension. Hence, cost-effective adequate control of sleep-time {BP} is of marked clinical relevance. Ingestion time, according to circadian rhythms, of hypertension medications of six different classes and their combinations significantly affects {BP} control, particularly sleep-time {BP}, and adverse effects. For example, because the high-amplitude circadian rhythm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activates during nighttime sleep, bedtime vs. morning ingestion of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers better reduces the asleep {BP} mean, with additional benefit, independent of medication terminal half-life, of converting the 24 h {BP} profile into more normal dipper patterning. The {MAPEC} (Monitorizacion Ambulatoria para Prediccion de Eventos Cardiovasculares) study, first prospective randomized treatment-time investigation designed to test the worthiness of bedtime chronotherapy with 1 conventional hypertension medications so as to specifically target attenuation of asleep {BP}, demonstrated, relative to conventional morning therapy, 61\% reduction of total {CVD} events and 67\% decrease of major {CVD} events, that is, {CVD} death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. The {MAPEC} study, along with other earlier conducted less refined trials, documents the asleep {BP} mean is the most significant prognostic marker of {CVD} morbidity and mortality; moreover, it substantiates attenuation of the asleep {BP} mean by a bedtime hypertension treatment strategy entailing the entire daily dose of 1 hypertension medications significantly reduces {CVD} risk in both general and more vulnerable hypertensive patients, that is, those diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, diabetes and resistant hypertension.},

Retinal detachment cases were defined as a procedure code for retinal repair surgery within 14 days of a physician service code. Ten controls were selected for each case using risk-set sampling, matching on age and the month and year of cohort entry. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURE}: The association between retinal detachment and current, recent, or past use of an oral fluoroquinolone. {RESULTS}: From a cohort of 989,591 patients, 4384 cases of retinal detachment and 43,840 controls were identified. Current use of fluoroquinolones was associated with a higher risk of developing a retinal detachment (3.3\% of cases vs 0.6\% of controls; adjusted rate ratio [{ARR}], 4.50 [95\% {CI}, 3.56-5.70]).

The absolute increase in the risk of a retinal detachment was 4 per 10,000 person-years (number needed to harm = 2500 computed for any use of fluoroquinolones). There was no evidence of an association between development of a retinal detachment and beta-lactam antibiotics ({ARR}, 0.74 [95\% {CI}, 0.35-1.57]) or short-acting beta-agonists ({ARR}, 0.95 [95\% {CI}, 0.68-1.33]). {CONCLUSION}: Patients taking oral fluoroquinolones were at a higher risk of developing a retinal detachment compared with nonusers, although the absolute risk for this condition was small.},

While their size allows for many analytical opportunities, as with most observational data there is also the potential for bias. One of the key sources of bias in {EHRs} is what we term informed presence-the notion that inclusion in an {EHR} is not random but rather indicates that the subject is ill, making people in {EHRs} systematically different from those not in {EHRs}. In this article, we use simulated and empirical data to illustrate the conditions under which such bias can arise and how conditioning on the number of health-care encounters can be one way to remove this bias. In doing so, we also show when such an approach can impart M bias, or bias from conditioning on a collider. Finally, we explore the conditions under which number of medical encounters can serve as a proxy for general health. We apply these methods to an {EHR} data set from a university medical center covering the years 2007-2013.},

The {INternational} {VErapamil} {SR}-trandolapril {STudy} compared a calcium antagonist-based (verapamil {SR}) and a beta-blocker-based (atenolol) strategy with trandolapril and/or hydrochlorothiazide added to control blood pressure ({BP}) in patients with {CAD}. The 16,176 patients without {DM} at entry were investigated with regard to newly diagnosed {DM} during follow-up.

Characteristics associated with risk for newly diagnosed {DM} included United States residence, left ventricular hypertrophy, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack, Hispanic ethnicity, coronary revascularization, hypercholesterolemia, greater body mass index, and higher follow-up systolic {BP}. Addition of trandolapril to verapamil {SR} decreased {DM} risk and addition of hydrochlorothiazide to atenolol increased risk.

Based on angina history at enrollment and during follow-up visits, patients were divided into groups: persistent angina (n = 7184), new-onset angina (n = 899), resolved angina (n = 4070), and never angina (n = 4798). Blood pressure was evaluated at baseline, during drug titration, and during follow-up on-treatment. On-treatment systolic {BP} was classified as tightly controlled ({\textless}130 mm Hg), controlled (130-139 mm Hg), or uncontrolled ({\textgreater}/=140 mm Hg). A Cox proportional hazards model was created adjusting for age, heart failure, diabetes, renal impairment, myocardial infarction, stroke, and smoking.

We sought to define contemporary trends in permanent pacemaker use by analyzing a large national database. {METHODS}: We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify permanent pacemaker implants between 1993 and 2009 using the International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification procedure codes for dual-chamber ({DDD}), single-ventricular ({VVI}), single-atrial ({AAI}), or biventricular ({BiV}) devices. Annual permanent pacemaker implantation rates and patient demographics were analyzed. {RESULTS}: Between 1993 and 2009, 2.9 million patients received permanent pacemakers in the United States. Overall use increased by 55.6\%. By 2009, {DDD} use increased from 62\% to 82\% (p {\textless} 0.001), whereas single-chamber ventricular pacemaker use fell from 36\% to 14\% (p = 0.01). Use of {DDD} devices was higher in urban, nonteaching hospitals (79\%) compared with urban teaching hospitals (76\%) and rural hospitals (72\%). Patients with private insurance (83\%) more commonly received {DDD} devices than Medicaid (79\%) or Medicare (75\%) recipients (p {\textless} 0.001). Patient age and Charlson comorbidity index increased over time. Hospital charges (\$2011) increased 45.3\%, driven by the increased cost of {DDD} devices. {CONCLUSIONS}: There is a steady growth in the use of permanent pacemakers in the United States. Although {DDD} device use is increasing, whereas single-chamber ventricular pacemaker use is decreasing. Patients are becoming older and have more medical comorbidities.

	abstract = {Hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death, and lowering blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs reduces target organ damage and prevents cardiovascular disease outcomes. Despite a plethora of available treatment options, a substantial portion of the hypertensive population has uncontrolled blood pressure. The unmet need of controlling blood pressure in this population may be addressed, in part, by developing new drugs and devices/procedures to treat hypertension and its comorbidities. In this Compendium Review, we discuss new drugs and interventional treatments that are undergoing preclinical or clinical testing for hypertension treatment. New drug classes, eg, inhibitors of vasopeptidases, aldosterone synthase and soluble epoxide hydrolase, agonists of natriuretic peptide A and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2, and a novel mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist are in phase {II}/{III} of development, while inhibitors of aminopeptidase A, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, and the intestinal Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3, agonists of components of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin(1-7)/Mas receptor axis and vaccines directed toward angiotensin {II} and its type 1 receptor are in phase I or preclinical development. The two main interventional approaches, transcatheter renal denervation and baroreflex activation therapy, are used in clinical practice for severe treatment resistant hypertension in some countries. Renal denervation is also being evaluated for treatment of various comorbidities, eg, chronic heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and chronic renal failure. Novel interventional approaches in early development include carotid body ablation and arteriovenous fistula placement. Importantly, none of these novel drug or device treatments has been shown to prevent cardiovascular disease outcomes or death in hypertensive patients.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Studies have challenged the appropriateness of accepted blood pressure targets. We hypothesised that different levels of low blood pressure are associated with benefit for some, but harm for other outcomes. {METHODS}: In this analysis, we assessed the previously reported outcome data from high-risk patients aged 55 years or older with a history of cardiovascular disease, 70\% of whom had hypertension, from the {ONTARGET} and {TRANSCEND} trials investigating ramipril, telmisartan, and their combination, with a median follow-up of 56 months. Detailed descriptions of randomisation and intervention have already been reported. We analysed the associations between mean blood pressure achieved on treatment; prerandomisation baseline blood pressure; or time-updated blood pressure (last on treatment value before an event) on the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospital admission for heart failure; the components of the composite outcome; and all-cause death. Analysis was done by Cox regression analysis, {ANOVA}, and chi2. These trials were registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}00153101. {FINDINGS}: Recruitment for {ONTARGET} took place between Dec 1, 2001, and July 31, 2008. {TRANSCEND} took place between Nov 1, 2001, and May 30, 2004. 30 937 patients were recruited from 733 centres in 40 countries and followed up for a median of 56 months. In {ONTARGET}, 25 127 patients known to be tolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme ({ACE})-inhibitors were randomly assigned after a run-in period to oral ramipril 10 mg/day (n=8407), telmisartan 80 mg/day (n=8386), or the combination of both (n=8334). In {TRANSCEND}, 5810 patients who were intolerant to {ACE}-inhibitors were randomly assigned to oral telmisartan 80 mg/day (n=2903) or placebo (n=2907). Baseline systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) 140 mm Hg or higher was associated with greater incidence of all outcomes compared with 120 mm Hg to less than 140 mm Hg. By contrast, a baseline diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}) less than 70 mm Hg was associated with the highest risk for most outcomes compared with all {DBP} categories 70 mm Hg or more. In 4052 patients with {SBP} less than 120 mm Hg on treatment, the risk of the composite cardiovascular outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [{HR}] 1.14, 95\% {CI} 1.03-1.26), cardiovascular death (1.29, 1.12-1.49), and all deaths (1.28, 1.15-1.42) were increased compared with those in whom {SBP} was 120-140 mm Hg during treatment ({HR} 1 for all outcomes, n=16099). No harm or benefit was observed for myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospital admission for heart failure. Mean achieved {SBP} more accurately predicted outcomes than baseline or time-updated {SBP}, and was associated with the lowest risk at approximately 130 mm Hg, and at 110-120 mm Hg risk increased for the combined outcome, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death except stroke. A mean {DBP} less than 70 mm Hg (n=5352) during treatment was associated with greater risk of the composite primary outcome ({HR} 1.31, 95\% {CI} 1.20-1.42), myocardial infarction (1.55, 1.33-1.80), hospital admission for heart failure (1.59, 1.36-1.86) and all-cause death (1.16, 1.06-1.28) than a {DBP} 70-80 mm Hg (14 305). A pretreatment and mean on-treatment {DBP} of about 75 mm Hg was associated with the lowest risk. {INTERPRETATION}: Mean achieved {SBP} less than 120 mm Hg during treatment was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes except for myocardial infarction and stroke. Similar patterns were observed for {DBP} less than 70 mm Hg, plus increased risk for myocardial infarction and hospital admission for heart failure. Very low blood pressure achieved on treatment was associated with increased risks of several cardiovascular disease events. These data suggest that the lowest blood pressure possible is not necessarily the optimal target for high-risk patients, although it is not possible to rule out some effect of reverse causality. {FUNDING}: Boehringer Ingelheim.},

	abstract = {{STUDY} {OBJECTIVE}: To compare costs associated with a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention with costs of usual care. {DESIGN}: Cost analysis using health care utilization and outcome data from two prospective, cluster-randomized, controlled clinical trials. {SETTING}: Eleven community-based medical offices. {PATIENTS}: A total of 496 patients with hypertension; 244 were in the usual care (control) group and 252 were in the intervention group. {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: To compare the costs, we combined cost data from the two trials. Total costs included costs of provider time, laboratory tests, and antihypertensive drugs. Provider time was calculated based on an online survey of intervention pharmacists and the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Cost parameters were taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for average wage rates, the Medicare laboratory fee schedule, and a publicly available Web site for drug prices. Total costs were adjusted for patient characteristics. Adjusted total costs were \$774.90 in the intervention group and \$445.75 in the control group (difference \$329.16, p{\textless}0.001). In a sensitivity analysis, the difference in adjusted total costs between the two groups ranged from \$224.27-515.56. The intervention cost required to have one additional patient achieve blood pressure control within 6 months was \$1338.05, determined by the difference in costs divided by the difference in hypertension control rates between the groups (\$329.16/24.6\%). The cost over 6 months to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure 1 mm Hg was \$36.25 and \$94.32, respectively. {CONCLUSION}: The physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention increased not only blood pressure control but also the cost of care. Additional research, such as a cost-benefit or a cost-minimization analysis, is needed to assess whether financial savings related to reduced morbidity and mortality achieved from better blood pressure control outweigh the cost of the intervention.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Patients with hospital-acquired acute kidney injury ({AKI}) are at risk for increased mortality and further medical complications. Evaluating these patients with a prediction tool easily implemented within an electronic health record ({EHR}) would identify high-risk patients prior to the development of {AKI} and could prevent iatrogenically induced episodes of {AKI} and improve clinical management. {METHODS}: The authors used structured clinical data acquired from an {EHR} to identify patients with normal kidney function for admissions from 1 August 1999 to 31 July 2003. Using administrative, computerized provider order entry and laboratory test data, they developed a 3-level risk stratification model to predict each of 2 severity levels of in-hospital {AKI} as defined by {RIFLE} criteria. The severity levels were defined as 150\% or 200\% of baseline serum creatinine. Model discrimination and calibration were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. {RESULTS}: Cross-validation of the models resulted in area under the receiver operating characteristic ({AUC}) curves of 0.75 (150\% elevation) and 0.78 (200\% elevation). Both models were adequately calibrated as measured by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test chi-squared values of 9.7 (P = 0.29) and 12.7 (P = 0.12), respectively. {CONCLUSIONS}: The authors generated risk prediction models for hospital-acquired {AKI} using only commonly available electronic data. The models identify patients at high risk for {AKI} who might benefit from early intervention or increased monitoring.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The apparent shortfall in prevention of coronary heart disease ({CHD}) noted in early hypertension trials has been attributed to disadvantages of the diuretics and beta blockers used. For a given reduction in blood pressure, some suggested that newer agents would confer advantages over diuretics and beta blockers. Our aim, therefore, was to compare the effect on non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal {CHD} of combinations of atenolol with a thiazide versus amlodipine with perindopril. {METHODS}: We did a multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled trial in 19 257 patients with hypertension who were aged 40-79 years and had at least three other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients were assigned either amlodipine 5-10 mg adding perindopril 4-8 mg as required (amlodipine-based regimen; n=9639) or atenolol 50-100 mg adding bendroflumethiazide 1.25-2.5 mg and potassium as required (atenolol-based regimen; n=9618). Our primary endpoint was non-fatal myocardial infarction (including silent myocardial infarction) and fatal {CHD}. Analysis was by intention to treat. {FINDINGS}: The study was stopped prematurely after 5.5 years' median follow-up and accumulated in total 106 153 patient-years of observation. Though not significant, compared with the atenolol-based regimen, fewer individuals on the amlodipine-based regimen had a primary endpoint (429 vs 474; unadjusted {HR} 0.90, 95\% {CI} 0.79-1.02, p=0.1052), fatal and non-fatal stroke (327 vs 422; 0.77, 0.66-0.89, p=0.0003), total cardiovascular events and procedures (1362 vs 1602; 0.84, 0.78-0.90, p{\textless}0.0001), and all-cause mortality (738 vs 820; 0.89, 0.81-0.99, p=0.025). The incidence of developing diabetes was less on the amlodipine-based regimen (567 vs 799; 0.70, 0.63-0.78, p{\textless}0.0001). {INTERPRETATION}: The amlodipine-based regimen prevented more major cardiovascular events and induced less diabetes than the atenolol-based regimen. On the basis of previous trial evidence, these effects might not be entirely explained by better control of blood pressure, and this issue is addressed in the accompanying article. Nevertheless, the results have implications with respect to optimum combinations of antihypertensive agents.},

	abstract = {Importance: Medical malpractice litigation against surgical residents is rarely discussed owing to assumed legal doctrine of respondeat superior, or "let the master answer." Objective: To better understand lawsuits targeting surgical trainees to prevent future litigation. Design, Setting, and Participants: Westlaw, an online legal research database containing legal records from across the United States, was retrospectively reviewed for malpractice cases involving surgical interns, residents, or fellows from January 1, 2005, to January 1, 2015. Infant-related obstetric and ophthalmologic procedures were excluded. Exposures: Involvement in a medical malpractice case. Main Outcomes and Measures: Data were collected on patient demographics, case characteristics, and outcomes and were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: During a 10-year period, 87 malpractice cases involving surgical trainees were identified. A total of 50 patients were female (57\%), and 79 were 18 years of age or older (91\%), with a median patient age of 44.5 years (interquartile range, 45-56 years). A total of 67 cases (77\%) resulted in death or permanent disability. Most cases involved elective surgery (61 [70\%]) and named a junior resident as a defendant (24 of 35 [69\%]). Cases more often questioned the perioperative medical knowledge, decision making errors, and injuries (53 [61\%]: preoperative, 19 of 53 [36\%]) and postoperative, 34 of 53 [64\%]) than intraoperative errors and injuries (43 [49\%]). Junior residents were involved primarily with lawsuits related to medical decision making (21 of 24 [87\%]). Residents' failure to evaluate the patient was cited in 10 cases (12\%) and lack of direct supervision by attending physicians was cited in 48 cases (55\%). A total of 42 cases (48\%) resulted in a jury verdict or settlement in favor of the plaintiff, with a median payout of \$900000 (range, \$1852 to \$32 million). Conclusions and Relevance: This review of malpractice cases involving surgical residents highlights the importance of perioperative management, particularly among junior residents, and the importance of appropriate supervision by attending physicians as targets for education on litigation prevention.},

	abstract = {Renal sympathetic hyperactivity is seminal in the maintenance and progression of hypertension. Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation has been shown to significantly reduce blood pressure ({BP}) in patients with hypertension. Durability of effect beyond 1 year using this novel technique has never been reported. A cohort of 45 patients with resistant hypertension (systolic {BP} ≥160 mm Hg on ≥3 antihypertension drugs, including a diuretic) has been originally published. Herein, we report longer-term follow-up data on these and a larger group of similar patients subsequently treated with catheter-based renal denervation in a nonrandomized manner. We treated 153 patients with catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation at 19 centers in Australia, Europe, and the United States. Mean age was 57±11 years, 39\% were women, 31\% were diabetic, and 22\% had coronary artery disease. Baseline values included mean office {BP} of 176/98±17/15 mm Hg, mean of 5 antihypertension medications, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 83±20 {mL}/min per 1.73 m(2). The median time from first to last radiofrequency energy ablation was 38 minutes. The procedure was without complication in 97\% of patients (149 of 153). The 4 acute procedural complications included 3 groin pseudoaneurysms and 1 renal artery dissection, all managed without further sequelae. Postprocedure office {BPs} were reduced by 20/10, 24/11, 25/11, 23/11, 26/14, and 32/14 mm Hg at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively.

	abstract = {The structure and process used in providing pharmaceutical care to ambulatory care patients at nine Veterans Affairs medical centers ({VAMCs}) were studied. Institutions participating in the {IMPROVE} (Impact of Managed Pharmaceutical Care on Resource Utilization and Outcomes in Veterans Affairs Medical Centers) study were selected. To assess the level of pharmaceutical care services provided to ambulatory care patients, 10 critical domains were identified. Six instruments with questions related to each domain were then designed, including a clinical pharmacist survey and an outpatient pharmacist survey. Each center was assessed through three surveys and an onsite visit. The investigators used both direct observation and a consensus approach to score the level of ambulatory care pharmaceutical services provided. The clinics in which {IMPROVE} study patients would be seen were run by pharmacists (33\%), physicians (44\%), and multidisciplinary teams (22\%). Of the 51 clinical pharmacists surveyed, 23 (45\%) had prescribing authority via protocols, 14 (28\%) had unrestricted prescribing privileges, and 14 did not have prescribing authority. The sites varied greatly in referral patterns, methods of identifying patients, and whether patient visits were scheduled or on a walk-in basis. There was a strong correlation between observed activities by clinical pharmacists and their self-reports and between observed activities by outpatient pharmacists and their self-reports. Activities reported by clinical pharmacists were moderately but not significantly correlated with consensus scores, and activities reported by outpatient pharmacists were poorly correlated with consensus scores. The structure and process for providing pharmaceutical care to ambulatory care patients at {VAMCs} were evaluated with surveys, direct observation, and a consensus-based scoring system.},

The trial was conducted at an integrated group practice in Washington state, enrolling 778 participants aged 25 to 75 years with uncontrolled essential hypertension and Internet access. Care was delivered over a secure patient Web site from June 2005 to December 2007. {INTERVENTIONS}: Participants were randomly assigned to usual care, home {BP} monitoring and secure patient Web site training only, or home {BP} monitoring and secure patient Web site training plus pharmacist care management delivered through Web communications. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Percentage of patients with controlled {BP} ({\textless}140/90 mm Hg) and changes in systolic and diastolic {BP} at 12 months. {RESULTS}: Of 778 patients, 730 (94\%) completed the 1-year follow-up visit. Patients assigned to the home {BP} monitoring and Web training only group had a nonsignificant increase in the percentage of patients with controlled {BP} ({\textless}140/90 mm Hg) compared with usual care (36\% [95\% confidence interval \{{CI}\}, 30\%-42\%] vs 31\% [95\% {CI}, 25\%-37\%]; P = .21). Adding Web-based pharmacist care to home {BP} monitoring and Web training significantly increased the percentage of patients with controlled {BP} (56\%; 95\% {CI}, 49\%-62\%) compared with usual care (P {\textless} .001) and home {BP} monitoring and Web training only (P {\textless} .001). Systolic {BP} was decreased stepwise from usual care to home {BP} monitoring and Web training only to home {BP} monitoring and Web training plus pharmacist care. Diastolic {BP} was decreased only in the pharmacist care group compared with both the usual care and home {BP} monitoring and Web training only groups. Compared with usual care, the patients who had baseline systolic {BP} of 160 mm Hg or higher and received home {BP} monitoring and Web training plus pharmacist care had a greater net reduction in systolic {BP} (-13.2 mm Hg [95\% {CI}, -19.2 to -7.1]; P {\textless} .001) and diastolic {BP} (-4.6 mm Hg [95\% {CI}, -8.0 to -1.2]; P {\textless} .001), and improved {BP} control (relative risk, 3.32 [95\% {CI}, 1.86 to 5.94]; P{\textless}.001). {CONCLUSION}: Pharmacist care management delivered through secure patient Web communications improved {BP} control in patients with hypertension.

Further, we assessed the impact of specific data elements on model discrimination, explanatory power, calibration, integrated discrimination improvement, net reclassification improvement, performance across different hospital units, and hospital rankings. {DESIGN}: Retrospective cohort study using logistic regression with split validation. {PARTICIPANTS}: A total of 248,383 patients who experienced 391,584 hospitalizations between January 1, 2008 and August 31, 2011. {SETTING}: Twenty-one hospitals in an integrated health care delivery system in Northern California. {RESULTS}: Inpatient and 30-day mortality rates were 3.02\% and 5.09\%, respectively. In the validation dataset, the greatest improvement in discrimination (increase in c statistic) occurred with the introduction of laboratory data; however, subsequent addition of vital signs and end-of-life care directive data had significant effects on integrated discrimination improvement, net reclassification improvement, and hospital rankings. Use of longitudinally captured comorbidities did not improve model performance when compared with present-on-admission coding. Our final model for inpatient mortality, which included laboratory test results, vital signs, and care directives, had a c statistic of 0.883 and a pseudo-R of 0.295. Results for inpatient and 30-day mortality were virtually identical. {CONCLUSIONS}: Risk-adjustment of hospital mortality using comprehensive electronic medical records is feasible and permits one to develop statistical models that better reflect actual clinician experience. In addition, such models can be used to assess hospital performance across specific subpopulations, including patients admitted to intensive care.},

Total mortality rates were nearly identical among the two treatment groups (167 and 166, respectively), as were cumulative mortality rates.

A significant (P = 0.0042) bidirectional interaction between diltiazem and pulmonary congestion was observed on x-ray examination. In 1909 patients without pulmonary congestion, diltiazem was associated with a reduced number of cardiac events (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95 percent confidence limits, 0.61 and 0.98); in 490 patients with pulmonary congestion, diltiazem was associated with an increased number of cardiac events (hazard ratio, 1.41; 95 percent confidence limits, 1.01 and 1.96). A similar pattern was observed with respect to the ejection fraction, which was dichotomized at 0.40. Thus, diltiazem exerted no overall effect on mortality or cardiac events in this population of patients with previous infarction.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recent reports suggest that calcium-channel blockers may be harmful in patients with diabetes and hypertension. We previously reported that antihypertensive treatment with the calcium-channel blocker nitrendipine reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. In this post hoc analysis, we compared the outcome of treatment with nitrendipine in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. {METHODS}: After stratification according to center, sex, and presence or absence of previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients (age, {\textgreater} or =60 years) with systolic blood pressure of 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic pressure below 95 mm Hg were randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg per day) with the possible addition or substitution of enalapril (5 to 20 mg per day) or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg per day) or both, titrated to reduce the systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg and to less than 150 mm Hg. In the control group, matching placebo tablets were administered similarly. {RESULTS}: At randomization, 492 patients (10.5 percent) had diabetes. After a median follow-up of two years, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the placebo and active-treatment groups differed by 8.6 and 3.9 mm Hg, respectively, among the diabetic patients. Among the 4203 patients without diabetes, systolic and diastolic pressures differed by 10.3 and 4.5 mm Hg, respectively, in the two groups. After adjustment for possible confounders, active treatment was found to have reduced overall mortality by 55 percent (from 45.1 deaths per 1000 patients to 26.4 deaths per 1000 patients), mortality from cardiovascular disease by 76 percent, all cardiovascular events combined by 69 percent, fatal and nonfatal strokes by 73 percent, and all cardiac events combined by 63 percent in the group of patients with diabetes. Among the nondiabetic patients, active treatment decreased all cardiovascular events combined by 26 percent and fatal and nonfatal strokes by 38 percent. In the group of patients receiving active treatment, reductions in overall mortality, mortality from cardiovascular disease, and all cardiovascular events were significantly larger among the diabetic patients than among the nondiabetic patients (P=0.04, P=0.02, and P=0.01, respectively). {CONCLUSIONS}: Nitrendipine-based antihypertensive therapy is particularly beneficial in older patients with diabetes and isolated systolic hypertension. Thus, our findings do not support the hypothesis that the use of long-acting calcium-channel blockers may be harmful in diabetic patients.},

We sought to identify sociodemographic predictors of hypertension prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and control among middle-income countries. We analyzed data from 47 443 adults in all 6 middle-income countries (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa) sampled in nationally representative household assessments from 2007 to 2010 as part of the World Health Organization Study on Global Aging and Adult Health. We estimated regression models accounting for age, sex, urban/rural location, nutrition, and obesity, as well as hypothesized covariates of healthcare access, such as income and insurance. Hypertension prevalence varied from 23\% (India) to 52\% (Russia), with between 30\% (Russia) and 83\% (Ghana) of hypertensives undiagnosed before the survey and between 35\% (Russia) and 87\% (Ghana) untreated. Although the risk of hypertension significantly increased with age (odds ratio, 4.6; 95\% confidence interval, 3.0-7.1; among aged, 60-79 versus {\textless}40 years), the risk of being undiagnosed or untreated fell significantly with age. Obesity was a significant correlate to hypertension (odds ratio, 3.7; 95\% confidence interval, 2.1-6.8 for obese versus normal weight), and was prevalent even among the lowest income quintile (13\% obesity). Insurance status and income also emerged as significant correlates to diagnosis and treatment probability, respectively. More than 90\% of hypertension cases were uncontrolled, with men having 3 times the odds as women of being uncontrolled. Overall, the social epidemiology of hypertension in middle-income countries seems to be correlated to increasing obesity prevalence, and hypertension control rates are particularly low for adult men across distinct cultures.},

Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths. {FINDINGS}: Of 5492 patients assigned captopril and 5493 assigned conventional therapy, 14 and 13, respectively, were lost to follow-up. Primary endpoint events occurred in 363 patients in the captopril group (11.1 per 1000 patient-years) and 335 in the conventional-treatment group (10.2 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.05 [95\% {CI} 0.90-1.22], p=0-52). Cardiovascular mortality was lower with captopril than with conventional treatment (76 vs 95 events; relative risk 0.77 [0.57-1-04], p=0.092), the rate of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction was similar (162 vs 161), but fatal and non-fatal stroke was more common with captopril (189 vs 148; 1.25 [1-01-1-55]. p=0.044). {INTERPRETATION}: Captopril and conventional treatment did not differ in efficacy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The difference in stroke risk is probably due to the lower levels of blood pressure obtained initially in previously treated patients randomised to conventional therapy.},

The authors conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the effects of {HBPM} on medication adherence. Of 440 abstracts and citations reviewed, 11 randomized control trials met predefined criteria. Six of the 11 randomized controlled trials reported statistically significant improvement in medication adherence; 84\% of these were complex interventions involving the use of {HBPM} in combination with other adherence-enhancing strategies such as patient counseling by nurses, pharmacists, or a telephone-linked system; patient education; and the use of timed medication reminders. Interventions conducted in primary care settings were not effective compared with those that occurred in hospital-based clinics or nonclinical settings. The data on the effects of {HBPM} on patients' medication-taking behavior are mixed. Future studies should investigate the independent effects of {HBPM} in primary care practices where the majority of hypertensive patients receive their care.},

	abstract = {Increased body weight is a strong risk factor for hypertension. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed to estimate the effect of weight reduction on blood pressure overall and in population subgroups. Twenty-five randomized, controlled trials (comprising 34 strata) published between 1966 and 2002 with a total of 4874 participants were included. A random-effects model was used to account for heterogeneity among trials. A net weight reduction of -5.1 kg (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], -6.03 to -4.25) by means of energy restriction, increased physical activity, or both reduced systolic blood pressure by -4.44 mm Hg (95\% {CI}, -5.93 to -2.95) and diastolic blood pressure by -3.57 mm Hg (95\% {CI}, -4.88 to -2.25). Blood pressure reductions were -1.05 mm Hg (95\% {CI}, -1.43 to -0.66) systolic and -0.92 mm Hg (95\% {CI}, -1.28 to -0.55) diastolic when expressed per kilogram of weight loss. As expected, significantly larger blood pressure reductions were observed in populations with an average weight loss {\textgreater}5 kg than in populations with less weight loss, both for systolic (-6.63 mm Hg [95\% {CI}, -8.43 to -4.82] vs -2.70 mm Hg [95\% {CI}, -4.59 to -0.81]) and diastolic (-5.12 mm Hg [95\% {CI}, -6.48 to -3.75] vs -2.01 mm Hg [95\% {CI}, -3.47 to -0.54]) blood pressure. The effect on diastolic blood pressure was significantly larger in populations taking antihypertensive drugs than in untreated populations (-5.31 mm Hg [95\% {CI}, -6.64 to -3.99] vs -2.91 mm Hg [95\% {CI}, -3.66 to -2.16]). This meta-analysis clearly shows that weight loss is important for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.},

We did a proof-of-principle trial of therapeutic renal sympathetic denervation in patients with resistant hypertension (ie, systolic blood pressure {\textgreater}/=160 mm Hg on three or more antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic) to assess safety and blood-pressure reduction effectiveness.{\textbar}We enrolled 50 patients at five Australian and European centres; 5 patients were excluded for anatomical reasons (mainly on the basis of dual renal artery systems). Patients received percutaneous radiofrequency catheter-based treatment between June, 2007, and November, 2008, with subsequent follow-up to 1 year. We assessed the effectiveness of renal sympathetic denervation with renal noradrenaline spillover in a subgroup of patients. Primary endpoints were office blood pressure and safety data before and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after procedure. Renal angiography was done before, immediately after, and 14-30 days after procedure, and magnetic resonance angiogram 6 months after procedure. We assessed blood-pressure lowering effectiveness by repeated measures {ANOVA}. This study is registered in Australia and Europe with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, numbers {NCT} 00483808 and {NCT} 00664638.{\textbar}In treated patients, baseline mean office blood pressure was 177/101 mm Hg ({SD} 20/15), (mean 4.7 antihypertensive medications); estimated glomerular filtration rate was 81 {mL}/min/1.73m(2) ({SD} 23); and mean reduction in renal noradrenaline spillover was 47\% (95\% {CI} 28-65\%). Office blood pressures after procedure were reduced by -14/-10, -21/-10, -22/-11, -24/-11, and -27/-17 mm Hg at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. In the five non-treated patients, mean rise in office blood pressure was +3/-2, +2/+3, +14/+9, and +26/+17 mm Hg at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months, respectively. One intraprocedural renal artery dissection occurred before radiofrequency energy delivery, without further sequelae.

The objective of this research is to examine the national burden of asthma and poor asthma control on health function, health perception and preference-based health-related quality of life ({HRQL}). {METHODS}: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey ({MEPS}), a nationally representative survey, was used to estimate the impact of asthma and indicators of poor asthma control on health function, self-rated health perception and preference-based {HRQL} using multivariate regression methods controlling for socioeconomic, clinical and demographic characteristics. Two {HRQL} instruments were used: {SF}-12v2 Physical Component Scale ({PCS}-12) and Mental Component Scale ({MCS}-12); {EQ}-5D-3L index and visual analogue scale ({VAS}). Two multivariate regression methods were used, Censored Least Absolute Deviation [{EQ}-5D-3L and {VAS} (due to censoring)] and Ordinary Least Squares ({OLS}) ({PCS}-12 and {MCS}-12). {RESULTS}: After controlling for covariates, asthma resulted in a statistically significant reduction in preference-based {HRQL}, health perception and physical and mental function ({EQ}-5D -0.023; {VAS} -2.21; {PCS}-12 -2.36; {MCS}-12 -0.96). Likewise, experiencing an exacerbation in the previous year and using more than three canisters of quick-relief medication in the previous 3 months were both associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in all four measures. {CONCLUSIONS}: Asthma itself and especially indicators of poor asthma control were associated with a deleterious effect on health function, preference-based {HRQL} and self-perceived health status.

Significant atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias, or both, were detected on presentation or during follow-up in 24 patients. Arrhythmias were present in only 8 of 51 survivors (16\%) but were detected in 16 of 30 patients (53\%) who died (p less than 0.05). Patients dying suddenly were even more likely to have had documented dysrhythmias (8 of 11, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular shortening fraction was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors (14.9 +/- 1.0\% vs 15.3 +/- 1.7\%). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in 44 patients who had cardiac catheterization averaged 20.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher in patients who died than in those who survived (29.5 +/- 2.2 vs 15.0 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Analysis of actuarial survival revealed that mortality was highest during the first 6 months after presentation (19\% mortality). Survival declined more gradually thereafter and was 70\% at 2 years, 64\% at 5 years and 52\% after 11.5 years. Age at initial presentation did not have any significant impact on survival. However, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 25 torr was associated with a significantly increased mortality rate (p less than 0.05). Early cardiac transplantation should be considered in patients with markedly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or complex atrial or ventricular arrhythmias.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: It has been suggested that low diastolic blood pressure ({BP}) while receiving antihypertensive treatment (hereinafter called on-treatment {BP}) is harmful in older patients with systolic hypertension. We examined the association between on-treatment diastolic {BP}, mortality, and cardiovascular events in the prospective placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe Trial. {METHODS}: Elderly patients with systolic hypertension were randomized into the double-blind first phase of the trial, after which all patients received active study drugs (phase 2). We assessed the relationship between outcome and on-treatment diastolic {BP} by use of multivariate Cox regression analysis during receipt of placebo (phase 1) and during active treatment (phases 1 and 2). {RESULTS}: Rates of noncardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events were 11.1, 12.0, and 29.4, respectively, per 1000 patient-years with active treatment (n = 2358) and 11.9, 12.6, and 39.0, respectively, with placebo (n = 2225). Noncardiovascular mortality, but not cardiovascular mortality, increased with low diastolic {BP} with active treatment (P {\textless} .005) and with placebo (P {\textless} .05); for example, hazard ratios for lower diastolic {BP}, that is, 65 to 60 mm Hg, were, respectively, 1.15 (95\% confidence interval, 1.00-1.31) and 1.28 (95\% confidence interval, 1.03-1.59). Low diastolic {BP} with active treatment was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, but only in patients with coronary heart disease at baseline (P {\textless} .02; hazard ratio for {BP} 65-60 mm Hg, 1.17; 95\% confidence interval, 0.98-1.38). {CONCLUSIONS}: These findings support the hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment can be intensified to prevent cardiovascular events when systolic {BP} is not under control in older patients with systolic hypertension, at least until diastolic {BP} reaches 55 mm Hg. However, a prudent approach is warranted in patients with concomitant coronary heart disease, in whom diastolic {BP} should probably not be lowered to less than 70 mm Hg.},

	abstract = {Resistant hypertension is a well recognized clinical entity, which has been inadequately researched to date.{\textbar}A multivariable Cox model was developed to identify baseline predictors of developing resistant hypertension among 3666 previously untreated Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial ({ASCOT}) patients and construct a risk score to identify those at high risk. Secondary analyses included evaluations among all 19 257 randomized patients.{\textbar}One-third (1258) of previously untreated, and one-half (9333) of all randomized patients (incidence rates 75.2 and 129.7 per 1000 person-years, respectively) developed resistant hypertension during a median follow-up of 5.3 and 4.8 years, respectively. Increasing strata of baseline {SBP} (151-160, 161-170, 171-180, and {\textgreater}180 {mmHg}) were associated with increased risk of developing resistant hypertension [hazard ratio 1.24 (95\% confidence interval, {CI} 0.81-1.88), 1.50 (1.03-2.20), 2.15 (1.47-3.16), and 4.43 (3.04-6.45), respectively]. Diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, male sex, and raised {BMI}, fasting glucose, and alcohol intake were other significant determinants of resistant hypertension. Randomization to amlodipine ± perindopril vs. atenolol ± thiazide [0.57 (0.50-0.60)], previous use of aspirin [0.78 (0.62-0.98)], and randomization to atorvastatin vs. placebo [0.87 (0.76-1.00)] significantly reduced the risk of resistant hypertension. Secondary analysis results were similar. The risk score developed allows accurate risk allocation (Harrell's C-statistic 0.71), with excellent calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ statistics, P = 0.99). A 12-fold (8.4-17.4) increased risk among those in the highest vs. lowest risk deciles was apparent.{\textbar}Baseline {SBP} and choice of subsequent antihypertensive therapy were the two most important determinants of resistant hypertension in the {ASCOT} population. Individuals at high risk of developing resistant hypertension can be easily identified using an integer-based risk score.},

However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether aortic stiffness is excessively high relative to the level of blood pressure ({BP}) among people with {RH}. This issue needs resolution as it could help refine management decisions guided by aortic stiffness. If conventional antihypertensive therapy fails to lower {BP} in patients with {RH}, there is good rationale for effectiveness of spironolactone as add on therapy, and this should also improve aortic stiffness. Lifestyle intervention with exercise and diet should be additionally efficacious towards improving {BP} and aortic stiffness in patients with {RH}, but there is limited data in this patient population. For better characterization on the effects of {BP} treatment on aortic stiffness, measures of central aortic {BP} may help refine management decisions above and beyond conventional arm cuff {BP}. There is strong evidence to support the use of aortic stiffness as a tool to aid risk stratification in hypertension management. Although there is a theoretical basis for special additional benefit of measuring aortic stiffness in patients with {RH} (as distinct from uncomplicated hypertension), at this time, there is inadequate data available to make definitive conclusions and is an area for future investigation.},

The lifetime probability of receiving antihypertensive medication was 60\%. The risk for hypertension remained unchanged for women, but it was approximately 60\% higher for men in the contemporary 1976-1998 period compared with an earlier 1952-1975 period. In contrast, the residual lifetime risk for stage 2 high blood pressure or higher (greater-than-or-equal to 160/100 mm Hg regardless of treatment) was considerably lower in both sexes in the recent period (35\%-57\% in 1952-1975 vs 35\%-44\% in 1976-1998), likely due to a marked increase in treatment of individuals with substantially elevated blood pressure. {CONCLUSION}: The residual lifetime risk for hypertension for middle-aged and elderly individuals is 90\%, indicating a huge public health burden.

	abstract = {Specific features of the 24-h blood pressure ({BP}) pattern are linked to progressive injury of target tissues and risk of cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) events. Several studies have consistently shown an association between blunted asleep {BP} decline and risk of fatal and nonfatal {CVD} events. Thus, there is growing focus on ways to properly control {BP} during nighttime sleep as well as during daytime activity. One strategy, termed chronotherapy, entails the timing of hypertension medications to endogenous circadian rhythm determinants of the 24-h {BP} pattern. Significant and clinically meaningful treatment-time differences in the beneficial and/or adverse effects of at least six different classes of hypertension medications, and their combinations, are now known. Generally, calcium channel blockers ({CCBs}) are more effective with bedtime than morning dosing, and for dihydropyridine derivatives bedtime dosing significantly reduces risk of peripheral edema. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is highly circadian rhythmic and activates during nighttime sleep. Accordingly, evening/bedtime ingestion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ({ACEIs}) benazepril, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, spirapril, trandolapril, and zofenopril exerts more marked effect on the asleep than awake systolic ({SBP}) and diastolic ({DBP}) {BP} means. Likewise, the bedtime, in comparison with morning, ingestion schedule of the angiotensin-{II} receptor blockers ({ARBs} irbesartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan exerts greater therapeutic effect on asleep {BP}, plus significant increase in the sleep-time relative {BP} decline, with the additional benefit, independent of drug terminal half-life, of converting the 24-h {BP} profile into a more normal dipping pattern. This is the case also for the bedtime versus upon-awakening regimen of combination {ARB}-{CCB}, {ACEI}-{CCB}, and {ARB}-diuretic medications. The chronotherapy of conventional hypertension medications constitutes a new and cost-effective strategy for enhancing the control of daytime and nighttime {SBP} and {DBP} levels, normalizing the dipping status of their 24-h patterning, and potentially reducing the risk of {CVD} events and end-organ injury, for example, of the blood vessels and tissues of the heart, brain, kidney, and retina.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To determine the relation between systolic blood pressure over time and the risk of macrovascular or microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. {DESIGN}: Prospective observational study. {SETTING}: 23 hospital based clinics in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. {PARTICIPANTS}: 4801 white, Asian Indian, and Afro-Caribbean {UKPDS} patients, whether randomised or not to treatment, were included in analyses of incidence; of these, 3642 were included in analyses of relative risk. {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Primary predefined aggregate clinical outcomes: any complications or deaths related to diabetes and all cause mortality. Secondary aggregate outcomes: myocardial infarction, stroke, lower extremity amputation (including death from peripheral vascular disease), and microvascular disease (predominantly retinal photocoagulation). Single end points: non-fatal heart failure and cataract extraction. Risk reduction associated with a 10 mm Hg decrease in updated mean systolic blood pressure adjusted for specific confounders. {RESULTS}: The incidence of clinical complications was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure, except for cataract extraction. Each 10 mm Hg decrease in updated mean systolic blood pressure was associated with reductions in risk of 12\% for any complication related to diabetes (95\% confidence interval 10\% to 14\%, P{\textless}0.0001), 15\% for deaths related to diabetes (12\% to 18\%, P{\textless}0.0001), 11\% for myocardial infarction (7\% to 14\%, P{\textless}0.0001), and 13\% for microvascular complications (10\% to 16\%, P{\textless}0.0001). No threshold of risk was observed for any end point. {CONCLUSIONS}: In patients with type 2 diabetes the risk of diabetic complications was strongly associated with raised blood pressure. Any reduction in blood pressure is likely to reduce the risk of complications, with the lowest risk being in those with systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg.},

We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study to analyze long-term survival, major adverse cardiovascular events, and factors associated with elevated risk in young adults undergoing {CABG}. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We included all adult patients {\textless}/=50 years of age who underwent primary isolated {CABG} in Sweden between 1997 and 2013 from the Swedish Web System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies ({SWEDEHEART}) register. Patient data were linked from national Swedish health data registers to create a study database. We identified 4086 young adults with a mean age of 46 years and 18\% women. During a median follow-up time of 10.9 years (interquartile range, 6.4-14.1) 490 (12\%) patients died. Survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was 96\% (95\% {CI}, 95-96), 90\% (95\% {CI}, 89-91), and 82\% (95\%{CI}, 80-83), respectively, which was significantly better in comparison with patients aged 51 to 70 years and {\textgreater}70 years who underwent {CABG} during the same period. The cumulative incidence of death or a major adverse cardiovascular event during 17 years after {CABG} was mainly driven by myocardial infarction or the need for repeat revascularization. The most important risk factors for all-cause mortality were chronic kidney disease, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, peripheral vascular disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. {CONCLUSIONS}: Long-term survival and freedom from major cardiovascular events after {CABG} was better in young adults than in older patients.

The purpose of this study was to assess the association of healthy lifestyle factors with cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality among individuals with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension. We studied participants (n=2043) from the population-based Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke ({REGARDS}) study with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (blood pressure {\textgreater}/=140/90 mm Hg despite the use of 3 antihypertensive medication classes or the use of {\textgreater}/=4 classes of antihypertensive medication regardless of blood pressure control). Six healthy lifestyle factors adapted from guidelines for the management of hypertension (normal waist circumference, physical activity {\textgreater}/=4 times/week, nonsmoking, moderate alcohol consumption, high Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet score, and low sodium-to-potassium intake ratio) were examined. A greater number of healthy lifestyle factors were associated with lower risk for cardiovascular events (n=360) during a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios [{HR} (95\% confidence interval)] for cardiovascular events comparing individuals with 2, 3, and 4 to 6 versus 0 to 1 healthy lifestyle factors were 0.91 (0.68-1.21), 0.80 (0.57-1.14), and 0.63 (0.41-0.95), respectively (P-trend=0.020). Physical activity and nonsmoking were individual healthy lifestyle factors significantly associated with lower risk for cardiovascular events. Similar associations were observed between healthy lifestyle factors and risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. In conclusion, healthy lifestyle factors, particularly physical activity and nonsmoking, are associated with a lower risk for cardiovascular events and mortality among individuals with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension.},

The objectives of this systematic review were to evaluate the systolic and diastolic {BP} reduction, and achievement of target {BP}, associated with self-monitoring. {METHODS}: {MEDLINE}, Embase, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, database of abstracts of clinical effectiveness, the health technology assessment database, the {NHS} economic evaluation database, and the {TRIP} database were searched for studies where the intervention included self-monitoring of {BP} and the outcome was change in office/ambulatory {BP} or proportion with controlled {BP}. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Meta-analysis using a random effects model was combined with meta-regression to investigate heterogeneity in effect sizes. {RESULTS}: A total of 25 eligible randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) (27 comparisons) were identified. Office systolic {BP} (20 {RCTs}, 21 comparisons, 5,898 patients) and diastolic {BP} (23 {RCTs}, 25 comparisons, 6,038 patients) were significantly reduced in those who self-monitored compared to usual care (weighted mean difference ({WMD}) systolic -3.82 {mmHg} (95\% confidence interval -5.61 to -2.03), diastolic -1.45 {mmHg} (-1.95 to -0.94)). Self-monitoring increased the chance of meeting office {BP} targets (12 {RCTs}, 13 comparisons, 2,260 patients, relative risk = 1.09 (1.02 to 1.16)). There was significant heterogeneity between studies for all three comparisons, which could be partially accounted for by the use of additional co-interventions. {CONCLUSION}: Self-monitoring reduces blood pressure by a small but significant amount. Meta-regression could only account for part of the observed heterogeneity.},

For this reason, recent attention has focused on calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. While these agents reduce blood pressure, outcome data from large randomized trials are lacking, but some case-control data, dominated by short-acting dihydropyridines, suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular events. These studies had methodologic limitations and did not differentiate among calcium antagonist types and formulations. Several studies differentiating among calcium antagonist types and an overview of published randomized trials show no increased risk with verapamil and suggestion for benefit in {CAD} patients.{\textbar}A total of 27,000 {CAD} patients with hypertension will be randomized at 1,500 primary care sites to receive either a calcium antagonist-based (verapamil) or beta-blocker/diuretic-based (atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide) antihypertensive care strategy. The study uses a novel, electronic "paper-less" system for direct on-screen data entry, randomization and drug distribution from a mail pharmacy linked to the coordination center via the Internet.{\textbar}Contract negotiations with the United States and international sites are ongoing. Patients being enrolled are predominantly elderly (72\% aged 60 years or older) men (54\%), with either an abnormal coronary angiogram or prior {MI} (71\%). In addition to hypertension, {CAD} and elderly age, most patients (89\%) have one or more associated conditions (diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, cerebral or peripheral vascular disease, etc.) contributing to increased risk for adverse outcome. While 26\% have diabetes, most of these are noninsulin dependent. Using the protocol strategies, target blood pressures (according to {JNC} {VI}) have been reached in 58\% at the fourth visit, and as expected most (89\%) are requiring multiple antihypertensive drugs.{\textbar}The design and baseline characteristics of the initial patients recruited for a prospective, randomized, international, multicenter study comparing two therapeutic strategies to control hypertension in {CAD} patients are described.},

This study was designed to compare two treatment options, spironolactone ({SPR}) versus dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ({RAAS}).{\textbar}Forty-two patients with true resistant hypertension were included in the study. An open-label prospective crossover design was used to add a second {RAAS} blocker to previous treatment and then {SPR} following 1 month of wash-out. {BP} was measured in the office and by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ({ABPM}).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The benefits of blood pressure lowering treatment for prevention of cardiovascular disease are well established. However, the extent to which these effects differ by baseline blood pressure, presence of comorbidities, or drug class is less clear. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify these differences. {METHOD}: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched {MEDLINE} for large-scale blood pressure lowering trials, published between Jan 1, 1966, and July 7, 2015, and we searched the medical literature to identify trials up to Nov 9, 2015. All randomised controlled trials of blood pressure lowering treatment were eligible for inclusion if they included a minimum of 1000 patient-years of follow-up in each study arm. No trials were excluded because of presence of baseline comorbidities, and trials of antihypertensive drugs for indications other than hypertension were eligible. We extracted summary-level data about study characteristics and the outcomes of major cardiovascular disease events, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, renal failure, and all-cause mortality. We used inverse variance weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses to pool the estimates. {RESULTS}: We identified 123 studies with 613 815 participants for the tabular meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses showed relative risk reductions proportional to the magnitude of the blood pressure reductions achieved. Every 10 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular disease events (relative risk [{RR}] 0.80, 95\% {CI} 0.77-0.83), coronary heart disease (0.83, 0.78-0.88), stroke (0.73, 0.68-0.77), and heart failure (0.72, 0.67-0.78), which, in the populations studied, led to a significant 13\% reduction in all-cause mortality (0.87, 0.84-0.91). However, the effect on renal failure was not significant (0.95, 0.84-1.07). Similar proportional risk reductions (per 10 mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure) were noted in trials with higher mean baseline systolic blood pressure and trials with lower mean baseline systolic blood pressure (all ptrend{\textgreater}0.05). There was no clear evidence that proportional risk reductions in major cardiovascular disease differed by baseline disease history, except for diabetes and chronic kidney disease, for which smaller, but significant, risk reductions were detected. beta blockers were inferior to other drugs for the prevention of major cardiovascular disease events, stroke, and renal failure. Calcium channel blockers were superior to other drugs for the prevention of stroke. For the prevention of heart failure, calcium channel blockers were inferior and diuretics were superior to other drug classes. Risk of bias was judged to be low for 113 trials and unclear for 10 trials. Heterogeneity for outcomes was low to moderate; the I2 statistic for heterogeneity for major cardiovascular disease events was 41\%, for coronary heart disease 25\%, for stroke 26\%, for heart failure 37\%, for renal failure 28\%, and for all-cause mortality 35\%. {INTERPRETATION}: Blood pressure lowering significantly reduces vascular risk across various baseline blood pressure levels and comorbidities. Our results provide strong support for lowering blood pressure to systolic blood pressures less than 130 mm Hg and providing blood pressure lowering treatment to individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. {FUNDING}: National Institute for Health Research and Oxford Martin School.},

This type of face-to-face visit has been referred to as university-based educational detailing, academic detailing, and educational visiting.{\textbar}To assess the effects of {EOVs} on health professional practice or patient outcomes.{\textbar}For this update, we searched the Cochrane {EPOC} register to March 2007. In the original review, we searched multiple bibliographic databases including {MEDLINE} and {CINAHL}.{\textbar}Randomised trials of {EOVs} that reported an objective measure of professional performance or healthcare outcomes. An {EOV} was defined as a personal visit by a trained person to healthcare professionals in their own settings.{\textbar}Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We used bubble plots and box plots to visually inspect the data. We conducted both quantitative and qualitative analyses. We used meta-regression to examine potential sources of heterogeneity determined a priori. We hypothesised eight factors to explain variation across effect estimates. In our primary visual and statistical analyses, we included only studies with dichotomous outcomes, with baseline data and with low or moderate risk of bias, in which the intervention included an {EOV} and was compared to no intervention.{\textbar}We included 69 studies involving more than 15,000 health professionals. Twenty-eight studies (34 comparisons) contributed to the calculation of the median and interquartile range for the main comparison. The median adjusted risk difference ({RD}) in compliance with desired practice was 5.6\% (interquartile range 3.0\% to 9.0\%). The adjusted {RDs} were highly consistent for prescribing (median 4.8\%, interquartile range 3.0\% to 6.5\% for 17 comparisons), but varied for other types of professional performance (median 6.0\%, interquartile range 3.6\% to 16.0\% for 17 comparisons). Meta-regression was limited by the large number of potential explanatory factors (eight) with only 31 comparisons, and did not provide any compelling explanations for the observed variation in adjusted {RDs}. There were 18 comparisons with continuous outcomes, with a median adjusted relative improvement of 21\% (interquartile range 11\% to 41\%). There were eight trials (12 comparisons) in which the intervention included an {EOV} and was compared to another type of intervention, usually audit and feedback. Interventions that included {EOVs} appeared to be slightly superior to audit and feedback. Only six studies evaluated different types of visits in head-to-head comparisons. When individual visits were compared to group visits (three trials), the results were mixed.{\textbar}{EOVs} alone or when combined with other interventions have effects on prescribing that are relatively consistent and small, but potentially important. Their effects on other types of professional performance vary from small to modest improvements, and it is not possible from this review to explain that variation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: With the increasing focus on reducing hospital readmissions in the United States, numerous readmissions risk prediction models have been proposed, mostly developed through analyses of structured data fields in electronic medical records and administrative databases. Three areas that may have an impact on readmission but are poorly captured using structured data sources are patients' physical function, cognitive status, and psychosocial environment and support. {OBJECTIVE} {OF} {THE} {STUDY}: The objective of the study was to build a discriminative model using information germane to these 3 areas to identify hospitalized patients' risk for 30-day all cause readmissions. {RESEARCH} {DESIGN}: We conducted clinician focus groups to identify language used in the clinical record regarding these 3 areas. We then created a dataset including 30,000 inpatients, 10,000 from each of 3 hospitals, and searched those records for the focus group-derived language using natural language processing. A 30-day readmission prediction model was developed on 75\% of the dataset and validated on the other 25\% and also on hospital specific subsets. {RESULTS}: Focus group language was aggregated into 35 variables. The final model had 16 variables, a validated C-statistic of 0.74, and was well calibrated. Subset validation of the model by hospital yielded C-statistics of 0.70-0.75. {CONCLUSIONS}: Deriving a 30-day readmission risk prediction model through identification of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial issues using natural language processing yielded a model that performs similarly to the better performing models previously published with the added advantage of being based on clinically relevant factors and also automated and scalable. Because of the clinical relevance of the variables in the model, future research may be able to test if targeting interventions to identified risks results in reductions in readmissions.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Selection of antihypertensive therapy is often empiric, and use of genetic information to guide drug therapy selection holds future promise. {TRIAL} {DESIGN}: The objective of this trial is to identify the genetic determinants of the antihypertensive and adverse metabolic responses to a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), a beta-blocker (atenolol), and their combination. This will be accomplished through candidate gene and genome-wide association approaches. Individuals with uncomplicated hypertension (N = 800), with ages 17 and 65 years, are being enrolled. Current antihypertensive therapy is discontinued, and hypertension is confirmed, along with collection of other baseline data. Subjects are then randomized to either hydrochlorothiazide or atenolol, with 1 dose titration step, followed by assessment of response to therapy after at least 6 weeks on the target dose. Those with blood pressure {\textgreater}120/70 mm Hg have the second drug added, with similar dose titration and response assessment procedures. Data collected include home, office, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. Biological samples collected in the fasting state include plasma, serum, {DNA} (buffy coat), and urine. Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphocyte cell lines are also being created. {CONCLUSIONS}: Pharmacogenetic-guided therapy holds clinical potential for hypertension, but the literature in the field is limited. This trial will add substantially to our understanding of the genetic determinants of antihypertensive and adverse metabolic responses to 2 commonly used antihypertensive drug classes.},

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the effects of {CTD} compared with {HCTZ} on cardiovascular event ({CVE}) rates. We performed a retrospective observational cohort study from the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial data set from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial was a cardiovascular primary prevention trial where participants were men 35 to 57 years of age enrolled and followed beginning in 1973. {CVEs} were measured yearly, and time to event was assessed by Cox regression.

In conclusion, both {HCTZ} and {CTD} reduce {CVEs} compared with neither drug.

Cases included all patients with hypertension who were referred to the care management program, and controls included patients with hypertension who were not referred to the program during the same 1-year period. Each case was matched to a maximum of 3 controls on the basis of primary care physician, age +/-5 years, gender, diagnoses of diabetes and kidney disease, baseline systolic blood pressure +/-10 mm Hg, and number of unique antihypertensive medications. Pharmacists provided a hypertension care management program under an approved scope of practice that allowed pharmacists to meet individually with patients, adjust medications, and provide patient education. Primary outcomes were systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure at 6 and 12 months. Multivariate regression models compared each blood pressure end point between cases and controls adjusting for age, comorbidities, baseline blood pressure, and baseline number of blood pressure medications. {RESULTS}: A total of 573 patients were referred to the hypertension program; 86\% (465/543) had at least 1 matched control and were included as cases in the analyses; 3:1 matching was achieved in 90\% (418/465) of cases. At baseline, cases and controls did not differ with respect to age, gender, race, or comorbidity; baseline blood pressure was higher (139.9/80.0 mm Hg vs 136.7/78.2 mm Hg, P {\textless}/= .0002) in the cases compared with controls. Multivariate regression modeling identified significantly lower systolic blood pressure for the cases compared with controls at both 6 and 12 months (6-month risk ratio [{RR}], 9.7; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 2.7-35.3; 12-month {RR}, 20.3; 95\% {CI}, 4.1-99.2; P {\textless} .01 for both comparisons).

Moreover, screening and hypertension treatment guidelines have been based mainly on findings for middle-aged and older populations. This study assesses relationships of {BP} measured in young adult men to long-term mortality due to coronary heart disease ({CHD}), cardiovascular diseases ({CVD}), and all causes. {METHODS}: This cohort from the Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry included 10 874 men aged 18 to 39 years at baseline (1967-1973), not receiving antihypertensive drugs, and without {CHD} or diabetes. Relationship of baseline {BP} to 25-year {CHD}, {CVD}, and all-cause mortality was assessed. {RESULTS}: Age-adjusted association of systolic {BP} to {CHD} mortality was continuous and graded. Multivariate-adjusted {CHD} hazard ratios ({HRs}) for 1 {SD} higher systolic {BP} (15 mm Hg) and diastolic {BP} (10 mm Hg) were 1.26 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.11-1.44) and 1.17 (95\% {CI}, 1.01-1.35), respectively.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The associations of blood pressure with the different manifestations of incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population have not been compared. In this study, we aimed to analyse the associations of blood pressure with 12 different presentations of cardiovascular disease. {METHODS}: We used linked electronic health records from 1997 to 2010 in the {CALIBER} ({CArdiovascular} research using {LInked} Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records) programme to assemble a cohort of 1.25 million patients, 30 years of age or older and initially free from cardiovascular disease, a fifth of whom received blood pressure-lowering treatments. We studied the heterogeneity in the age-specific associations of clinically measured blood pressure with 12 acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases, and estimated the lifetime risks (up to 95 years of age) and cardiovascular disease-free life-years lost adjusted for other risk factors at index ages 30, 60, and 80 years. This study is registered at {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}01164371. {FINDINGS}: During 5.2 years median follow-up, we recorded 83,098 initial cardiovascular disease presentations. In each age group, the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease was in people with systolic blood pressure of 90-114 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 60-74 mm Hg, with no evidence of a J-shaped increased risk at lower blood pressures. The effect of high blood pressure varied by cardiovascular disease endpoint, from strongly positive to no effect. Associations with high systolic blood pressure were strongest for intracerebral haemorrhage (hazard ratio 1.44 [95\% {CI} 1.32-1.58]), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1.43 [1.25-1.63]), and stable angina (1.41 [1.36-1.46]), and weakest for abdominal aortic aneurysm (1.08 [1.00-1.17]). Compared with diastolic blood pressure, raised systolic blood pressure had a greater effect on angina, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic pressure. Pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic aneurysm ({HR} per 10 mm Hg 0.91 [95\% {CI} 0.86-0.98]) and strongest for peripheral arterial disease (1.23 [1.20-1.27]). People with hypertension (blood pressure {\textgreater}/=140/90 mm Hg or those receiving blood pressure-lowering drugs) had a lifetime risk of overall cardiovascular disease at 30 years of age of 63.3\% (95\% {CI} 62.9-63.8) compared with 46.1\% (45.5-46.8) for those with normal blood pressure, and developed cardiovascular disease 5.0 years earlier (95\% {CI} 4.8-5.2). Stable and unstable angina accounted for most (43\%) of the cardiovascular disease-free years of life lost associated with hypertension from index age 30 years, whereas heart failure and stable angina accounted for the largest proportion (19\% each) of years of life lost from index age 80 years. {INTERPRETATION}: The widely held assumptions that blood pressure has strong associations with the occurrence of all cardiovascular diseases across a wide age range, and that diastolic and systolic associations are concordant, are not supported by the findings of this high-resolution study. Despite modern treatments, the lifetime burden of hypertension is substantial. These findings emphasise the need for new blood pressure-lowering strategies, and will help to inform the design of randomised trials to assess them. {FUNDING}: Medical Research Council, National Institute for Health Research, and Wellcome Trust.},

In 2051 subjects representative of the general population of Monza, we measured office, ambulatory, and home blood pressure ({BP}). The risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality was assessed over 16 years in normotensive, sustained hypertensive, and {WCH} subjects, the last group being defined as usually done in clinical practice (ie, by normality of 1 out-of-office [ambulatory or home] {BP} with an office {BP} elevation). Compared with normotensive subjects, the risk of cardiovascular mortality, as adjusted for potential confounders, showed a progressive significant increase in {WCH} and sustained hypertensive subjects (2.04 and 2.94; P=0.006). In either group, a significant increase in adjusted risk was also seen for all-cause mortality. However, when the {WCH} group was subdivided into 2 subgroups, that is, subjects in whom both out-of-office {BPs} were normal (true {WCH}, 42\%) or one {BP} was normal whereas the other was elevated (partial {WCH}, 58\%), only the latter showed a significantly greater adjusted risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (2.76 and 1.58; P{\textless}0.03). Compared with normotensive subjects, the partial {WCH} group also exhibited a marked increase in adjusted risk of developing sustained hypertension over a 10-year time period (2.58; P{\textless}0.0001), but in this case the risk was also increased in true {WCH} subjects (2.89; P{\textless}0.0001).

	abstract = {Two recent meta-analyses of randomised salt reduction trials have concluded that there is little purpose in reducing salt intake in the general population. However, the authors, as with other previous meta-analyses, included trials of very short duration (eg 1 week or less) and trials of acute salt loading followed by abrupt reductions to very low salt intake (eg from 20 to less than 1 g of salt/day). These acute salt loading and salt depletion experiments are known to increase sympathetic tone, and with salt depletion cause a rise in renin release and, thereby, plasma angiotensin {II}. These trials are not appropriate, therefore, for helping to inform public health policy, which is for a more modest reduction in salt intake, ie, from a usual intake of approximately 10 to approximately 5 g of salt per day over a more prolonged period of time. We carried out a meta-analysis to assess the effect of a modest salt reduction on blood pressure. Our data sources were {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, Cochrane library, {CINAHL}, and the reference lists of original and review articles. We included randomised trials with a modest reduction in salt intake and a duration of 4 or more weeks. Meta-analysis, meta-regression, and funnel plots were performed. A total of 17 trials in hypertensives (n=734) and 11 trials in normotensives (n=2220) were included in our study. The median reduction in 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 78 mmol (equivalent to 4.6 g of salt/day) in hypertensives and 74 mmol in normotensives. The pooled estimates of blood pressure fall were 4.96/2.73+/-0.40/0.24 {mmHg} in hypertensives (P{\textless}0.001 for both systolic and diastolic) and 2.03/0.97+/-0.27/0.21 {mmHg} in normotensives (P{\textless}0.001 for both systolic and diastolic). Weighted linear regression analyses showed a dose response between the change in urinary sodium and blood pressure. A reduction of 100 mmol/day (6 g of salt) in salt intake predicted a fall in blood pressure of 7.11/3.88 {mmHg} (P{\textless}0.001 for both systolic and diastolic) in hypertensives and 3.57/1.66 {mmHg} in normotensive individuals (systolic: P{\textless}0.001; diastolic: P{\textless}0.05). Our results demonstrate that a modest reduction in salt intake for a duration of 4 or more weeks does have a significant and, from a population viewpoint, important effect on blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals. This meta-analysis strongly supports other evidence for a modest and long-term reduction in population salt intake, and would be predicted to reduce stroke deaths immediately by approximately 14\% and coronary deaths by approximately 9\% in hypertensives, and reduce stroke and coronary deaths by approximately 6 and approximately 4\%, in normotensives, respectively.},

	abstract = {Ambulatory blood pressure ({BP}) monitoring is probably becoming a clinically useful procedure for the evaluation of hypertensive patients. Previous reports have shown that the devices are safe and serious side effects are rare. Discomfort and inconveniences associated with its use are more frequent. In this study, patient acceptance of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ({ABPM}) was compared with acceptance of other diagnostic procedures and their side effects were assessed. Patients were asked to fill in a form and 129 of 166 patients responded. The acceptance was measured with a visual analogue scale which ranged from 'very annoying' on the left to 'not annoying at all' on the right. All forms were collected anonymously. Mean distance (cm) of the visual likert scale was 8.6 to 9.4 for the diagnostic procedures frequently used in routine patient care. Ambulatory {BP} measurement ({ABPM}) scored 6.1 cm. Reported side effects (in 27\% of patients) were: plan (9\%), skin irritation (8\%), noisy device (8\%), inconvenience with work (3\%), haematoma (2\%) and other (4\%). Reports from the patients on sleep quality were: 23\% normal, 61\% minor disturbance, 14\% had sleep, and 2\% did not sleep at all. It can be concluded that ambulatory {BP} monitoring was the diagnostic procedure with the lowest patient acceptance. Side effects of this new technology were reported by 27\% of patients. However, risks are relatively minor. Sleep disturbances were very frequent and was a serious problem for 16\% of patients.},

The mean age of the patients was 59 +/- 7 years and 31\% were women. Exclusion criteria were myocardial infarction within the previous 3 years and contraindications to beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. The patients were followed between 6 and 75 months (median 3.4 years and a total of 2887 patient years). {INTERVENTION}: The patients were treated with either metoprolol (Seloken {ZOC} 200 mg o.d.) or verapamil (Isoptin Retard 240 b.i.d.). Acetylsalicylic acid, {ACE} inhibitors, lipid lowering drugs and long acting nitrates were allowed in the study. {END} {POINTS}: Death, non-fatal cardiovascular events including acute myocardial infarction, incapacitating or unstable angina, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular events. Psychological variables reflecting quality of life i.e. psychosomatic symptoms, sleep disturbances and an evaluation of overall life satisfaction. {RESULTS}: Combined cardiovascular events did not differ and occurred in 30.8\% and 29.3\% of metoprolol and verapamil treated patients respectively. Total mortality in metoprolol and verapamil treated patients was 5.4 and 6.2\%, respectively. Cardiovascular mortality was 4.7\% in both groups. Non-fatal cardiovascular events occurred in 26.1 and 24.3\% of metoprolol and verapamil-treated patients, respectively. Psychosomatic symptoms and sleep disturbances were significantly improved in both treatment groups. The magnitudes of change were small and did not differ between treatments.

Patients over the age of 35 years attending outpatient clinics in 18 hospitals of eight major cities of northern and southern China were interviewed between June and July, 1999. Trained fieldworkers completed questionnaires regarding demographics, hypertension knowledge and awareness, treatment history and quality of life issues. Qualified physicians performed blood pressure assessments. {RESULTS}: A total of 9703 volunteers were enrolled; 4510 (46.5\%) had hypertension. The results showed that hypertensive subjects scored lower in the multiple linear regression analyses in most questions on the quality of life questionnaire than those without hypertension after controlling for age, sex, sociodemographic factors, and co-morbidity. There was a strikingly high prevalence of physical complaints or symptoms. Among the variables considered, age, sex, hypertension, body mass index, educational level, smoking, history of cholesterol, family history of cardiovascular diseases and history of diabetes were statistically significantly correlated with health-related quality of life. Subjects aware of having high blood pressure had a lower health-related quality of life score than subjects with high blood pressure but unaware of the diagnosis. Among treated subjects, those with controlled hypertension had higher health-related quality of life scores than those with poorly controlled hypertension. {CONCLUSIONS}: Hypertensive individuals represent a vulnerable population that merits special attention from healthcare providers and systems. This is especially important given that low health-related quality of life can be a risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular events or complications.},

	abstract = {Resistant hypertension is a major opportunity for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Despite widespread dissemination of consensus guidelines, most patients are uncontrolled with approaches that assume that all patients are the same. Causes of resistant hypertension include 1) non-compliance 2) consumption of substances that aggravate hypertension (such as salt, alcohol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, licorice, decongestants) and 3) secondary hypertension. Selecting the appropriate therapy for a patient depends on finding the cause of the hypertension. Once rare causes have been eliminated (such as pheochromocytoma, licorice, adult coarctation of the aorta), the cause will usually be found by intelligent interpretation (in the light of medications then being taken) of plasma renin and aldosterone.If stimulated renin is low and the aldosterone is high, the problem is primary aldosteronism, and the best treatment is usually aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone; high-dose amiloride for men where eplerenone is not available). If the renin is high, with secondary hyperaldosteronism, the best treatment is angiotensin receptor blockers or aliskiren. If the renin and aldosterone are both low the problem is over-activity of renal sodium channels and the treatment is amiloride. This approach is particularly important in patients of African origin, who are more likely to have low-renin hypertension.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Deaths attributed to lack of preventive health care or timely and effective medical care can be considered avoidable. In this report, avoidable causes of death are either preventable, as in preventing cardiovascular events by addressing risk factors, or treatable, as in treating conditions once they have occurred. Although various definitions for avoidable deaths exist, studies have consistently demonstrated high rates in the United States. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of U.S. deaths (approximately 800,000 per year) and many of them (e.g., heart disease, stroke, and hypertensive deaths among persons aged {\textless}75 years) are potentially avoidable. {METHODS}: National Vital Statistics System mortality data for the period 2001-2010 were analyzed. Avoidable deaths were defined as those resulting from an underlying cause of heart disease (ischemic or chronic rheumatic), stroke, or hypertensive disease in decedents aged {\textless}75 years. Rates and trends by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and place were calculated. {RESULTS}: In 2010, an estimated 200,070 avoidable deaths from heart disease, stroke, and hypertensive disease occurred in the United States, 56\% of which occurred among persons aged {\textless}65 years. The overall age-standardized death rate was 60.7 per 100,000. Rates were highest in the 65-74 years age group, among males, among non-Hispanic blacks, and in the South. During 2001-2010, the overall rate declined 29\%, and rates of decline varied by age. {CONCLUSIONS}: Nearly one fourth of all cardiovascular disease deaths are avoidable. These deaths disproportionately occurred among non-Hispanic blacks and residents of the South. Persons aged {\textless}65 years had lower rates than those aged 65-74 years but still accounted for a considerable share of avoidable deaths and demonstrated less improvement. {IMPLICATIONS} {FOR} {PUBLIC} {HEALTH} {PRACTICE}: National, state, and local initiatives aimed at improving health-care systems and supporting healthy behaviors are essential to reducing avoidable heart disease, stroke, and hypertensive disease deaths. Strategies include promoting the {ABCS} (aspirin when appropriate, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation), reducing sodium consumption, and creating healthy environments.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to provide a contemporary qualitative and quantitative analysis of coronary angiograms from a large series of women enrolled in the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation ({WISE}) study who had suspected ischemic chest pain. Previous studies have suggested that women with chest pain have a lower prevalence of significant coronary artery disease ({CAD}) compared with men. Detailed analyses of angiographic findings relative to risk factors and outcomes are not available. All coronary angiograms were reviewed in a central core laboratory. Quantitative measurement of percent stenosis was used to assess the presence and severity of disease. Of the 323 women enrolled in the pilot phase, 34\% had no detectable, 23\% had measurable but minimal, and 43\% had significant ( {\textgreater} 50\% diameter stenosis) {CAD}. Of those with significant {CAD}, most had multivessel disease. Features suggesting complex plaque were identified in {\textless} 10\%. Age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior myocardial infarction ({MI}), current hormone replacement therapy, and unstable angina were all significant, independent predictors of presence of significant disease (p {\textless} 0.05). Subsequent hospitalization for a cardiac cause occurred more frequently in those women with minimal and significant disease compared with no disease (p = 0.001). The common findings of no and extensive {CAD} among symptomatic women at coronary angiography highlight the need for better clinical noninvasive evaluations for ischemia. Women with minimal {CAD} have intermediate rates of rehospitalization and cardiovascular events, and thus should not be considered low risk.},

Continuous positive airway pressure ({CPAP}) reduces blood pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and sustained hypertension. However, the impact of {CPAP} on patients with obstructive sleep apnea and prehypertension and masked hypertension, conditions associated with increased cardiovascular risk, is unknown. Thirty-six male patients (age, 43 ± 7 years; body mass index, 28.8 ± 3.0 kg/m(2)) with untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index, 56 ± 22 events/hr on polysomnography) with diagnostic criteria for prehypertension and/or masked hypertension, based on office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, respectively, were studied. The patients randomized to no treatment (control; n=18) or {CPAP} (n=18) for 3 months had similar frequency of prehypertension and masked hypertension at study entry. There were no significant changes in blood pressure in patients randomized to the control group. In contrast, patients randomized to {CPAP} presented significant reduction in office systolic (from 126 ± 5 to 121 ± 7 mm Hg; P=0.001) and a trend for diastolic blood pressure (from 75 ±7 to 73 ± 8 mm Hg; P=0.08) as well as a significant decrease in daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P{\textless}0.05 for each comparison). There was a significant reduction in the frequency of prehypertension (from 94\% to 55\%; P=0.02) and masked hypertension (from 39\% to 5\%; P=0.04) only in the {CPAP} group. In conclusion, effective {CPAP} therapy promotes significant reduction in the frequency of prehypertension and masked hypertension by promoting significant blood pressure reductions in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea.},

Meta-analysis according to baseline kidney function was performed. Pooled hazard ratios per 5 mm Hg lower blood pressure were estimated with a random effects model. {RESULTS}: Compared with placebo, blood pressure lowering regimens reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by about a sixth per 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure in individuals with (hazard ratio 0.83, 95\% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.90) and without reduced {eGFR} (0.83, 0.79 to 0.88), with no evidence for any difference in effect (P=1.00 for homogeneity).

We, therefore, analyzed gender-specific trends in the control of blood pressure and prevalence of 5 other cardiovascular risk factors (central obesity, elevated total cholesterol, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hyperglycemia, and smoking) among adults with diagnosed hypertension in the United States. We included 3475 participants aged {\textgreater}or=18 years with diagnosed hypertension in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. The age-adjusted prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure was 50.8+/-2.1\% in men and 55.9+/-1.5\% in women, which were not significantly different and had not changed significantly with time. Central obesity, elevated total cholesterol level, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly more prevalent in women than in men (79.0+/-1.0\%, 61.3+/-1.6\%, and 39.7+/-1.6\% versus 63.9+/-1.6\%, 48.1+/-1.8\%, and 35.6+/-1.7\%, respectively; P{\textless}0.05).

An integrated view of the issue of quality of life in patients with anxiety disorders can provide important information regarding the nature and extent of the burden associated with these disorders and may be useful in the development of strategies to deal with it. {METHOD}: A review of epidemiological and clinical studies that have investigated quality of life (broadly conceptualized) in patients with panic disorder, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder was conducted by searching {MEDLINE} and {PsycLIT} citations from 1984 to 1999. A summary of the key articles published in this area is presented. {RESULTS}: The studies reviewed portray an almost uniform picture of anxiety disorders as illnesses that markedly compromise quality of life and psychosocial functioning. Significant impairment can also be found in individuals with subthreshold forms of anxiety disorders. Effective pharmacological or psychotherapeutic treatment has been shown to improve the quality of life for patients with panic disorder, social phobia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Limitations in current knowledge in this area are identified, and suggestions for needed future research are provided. {CONCLUSIONS}: It is expected that a more thorough understanding of the impact on quality of life will lead to increased public awareness of anxiety disorders as serious mental disorders worthy of further investment in research, prevention, and treatment.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The aim of the study was to assess the longitudinal association between cardiovascular risk factors including albuminuria and other variables (e.g. awareness of hypertension, number of types of antihypertensive drugs, comorbidity), and health-related quality of life ({HRQOL}) in a large cohort of patients with hypertension, over a follow-up period of 5 years. {METHODS}: Nine thousand nine hundred and fifty-three participants of the {ESTHER} (Epidemiologische Studie zu Chancen der Verhutung, Fruherkennung und optimierten Therapie chronischer Erkrankungen) study - a population-based cohort study of middle-aged and older adults aged 50-74 years at baseline - were recruited by general practitioners ({GPs}) in 2000-2002 and included in the follow-up (2005-2007). {HRQOL} at baseline and follow-up was measured using the Short-Form General Health Survey ({SF}-12). Mental component scores ({MCS}) and physical component scores ({PCS}) were calculated. Multiple linear regression models were used to determine longitudinal predictors of {HRQOL} at follow-up. {RESULTS}: Four thousand, two hundred and three patients with hypertension (98.2\%) responded to the {SF}-12 both at baseline and after 5 years and were therefore included in the study. Smoking status, {BMI}, diabetes, macroalbuminuria, comorbid diseases, history of depression, and lower {HRQOL} at baseline predicted lower {PCS} at the 5-year follow-up. Lower {MCS} after 5 years was predicted by smoking status, dyslipidaemia, a reported history of depression, and {HRQOL} at baseline. No significant association was detected between awareness of hypertension and any {HRQOL} component score after 5 years. {CONCLUSIONS}: Macroalbuminuria and other variables related to increased cardiovascular risk have a negative impact on {PCS}. Suggestions of a link of treatment and awareness of hypertension with {HRQOL} from previous cross-sectional studies are not supported by our longitudinal findings.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: The randomized, multicentre study compared the efficacy of renal denervation ({RDN}) versus spironolactone addition in patients with true resistant hypertension. We present the 24-month data. {METHODS}: A total of 106 patients with true resistant hypertension were enrolled in this study: 52 patients were randomized to {RDN} and 54 patients to the spironolactone addition, with baseline {SBP} of 159 +/- 17 and 155 +/- 17 {mmHg} and average number of drugs 5.1 and 5.4, respectively. Two-year data are available in 86 patients. Spironolactone addition, as crossover after 1 year, was performed in 23 patients after {RDN}, and spironolactone addition followed by {RDN} was performed in five patients. {RESULTS}: Similar and comparable reduction of 24-h {SBP} after {RDN} or spironolactone addition after randomization was observed, 9.1 {mmHg} (P = 0.001) and 10.9 {mmHg} (P = 0.001), respectively. Similar decrease of office blood pressure ({BP}) was observed, 17.7 {mmHg} (P {\textless} 0.001) versus 14.1 {mmHg} (P {\textless} 0.001), whereas the number of antihypertensive drugs did not differ significantly between groups. Crossover analysis showed nonsignificantly better efficacy of spironolactone addition in 24-h {SBP} and office {SBP} reduction than {RDN} (3.7 {mmHg}, P = 0.27 and 4.6 {mmHg}, P = 0.28 in favour of spironolactone addition, respectively). Meanwhile, the number of antihypertensive drugs was significantly increased after spironolactone addition (+0.7, P = 0.001). {CONCLUSION}: In the settings of true resistant hypertension, spironolactone addition (if tolerated) seems to be of better efficacy than {RDN} in {BP} reduction over a period of 24 months.

	abstract = {Objective To estimate the economic burden of hypertension in a given year in rural Yunnan Province of China, including direct, indirect and intangible costs. Methods A prevalence-based cost-of-illness method was used to estimate the economic burden of hypertension. Data on participants' demographic characteristics, inpatient hospitalisation expenditures, outpatient visit expenditures, self-medication costs and indirect costs related to hypertension were collected from a cross-sectional health examination and questionnaire survey, involving 9396 consenting individuals aged {\textgreater}/=18 years and 3500 households. Blood pressure ({BP}) levels were determined from the average of three {BP} measurements. Years of life lost ({YLL}) because of hypertension was estimated using medical death certificates. Results The overall prevalence of and {YLL}/1000 population because of hypertension was 24.8\% and 1.5 years for the survey population, respectively. Mean unit direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, morbidity costs, mortality costs, intangible costs and cost of illness were estimated to be \$467.2, \$20.1, \$23.5, \$8265.1, \$417.4 and \$9393.3, respectively. The total cost of hypertension was estimated to be \$231.7 million. Direct costs represented the largest component of economic cost of hypertension. On average, males had higher overall direct, indirect and intangible costs of hypertension than females. Both indirect and intangible costs decreased with age, whereas direct costs increased with age. The incidence of household catastrophic health payment and household impoverishment because of hypertension was 8.9\% and 4.1\%, respectively. Conclusions Hypertension inflicts a considerable economic burden upon individual households and society as a whole in Yunnan Province, China.},

	abstract = {Influenza infection is annually responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among the very young and old. Recently updated guidelines recommend influenza vaccination of all children aged 6 months to 18 years; however, childhood vaccination remains underutilized. Furthermore, concerns over the reduced efficacy of vaccination in children have further heightened the need for effective treatment schemes. Antiviral therapies have emerged as attractive options in the battle against influenza infection. These agents include the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir, oseltamivir, and peramivir). Broad-scale use of adamantane antivirals has been severely limited in recent years because of high resistance rates and their inability to cover influenza type B. Neuraminidase inhibitors cover influenza types A and B, and have been promulgated to first-line therapy because of historically low resistance rates and relatively infrequent side effects. Moreover, these agents are effective options in combating non-seasonal influenza strains, including H5N1 and pandemic 2009 H1N1. Oseltamivir may be particularly appealing for treating children since it is available in multiple oral dosage formulations, whereas commercially available zanamivir use is limited in young children because it requires inhalation. However, the emergence of resistance to oseltamivir among influenza A strains may limit its usefulness. Additional concerns with neuraminidase inhibitor use in pediatrics center around emerging reports, primarily from Japan, that have temporally linked oseltamivir to significant neuropsychiatric events in children of varying ages. Numerous novel antiviral agents are under development, but most are far from market approval. In addition to treating and preventing the initial burden of pediatric influenza infection, antiviral therapies may significantly reduce secondary bacterial infections (including pneumonia and otitis media), unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, and healthcare-associated costs. © 2010 Adis Data Information {BV}.

We analyzed antihypertensive use among patients with {TRH} (treated with ≥4 antihypertensive drugs concurrently) from July 2008 through December 2014 using Marketscan administrative data. We included adults aged 18 to 65 years, with ≥6 months of continuous enrollment, a hypertension diagnosis, and ≥1 episode of overlapping use of ≥4 antihypertensive drugs; patients with heart failure were excluded. We identified 411 652 unique {TRH} episodes from 261 652 patients with a mean age of 55.9 years. From 2008 to 2014, we observed an increased prevalence, among {TRH} episodes, of β-blockers (+6.8\% [79\% to 85.8\%]) and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (+8.1\% [69.1\% to 77.2\%]), and a decreased prevalence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (-12.5\% [60.4\% to 47.9\%]) and nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists (-5.0\% [15\% to 10\%]). The prevalence of most other classes changed by {\textless}5\% from 2008 to 2014.

Objective: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of the factor Xa ({FXa}) inhibitor betrixaban for extended-duration prophylaxis of acute medically ill patients with venous thromboembolism ({VTE}) risk factors. Data Sources: A {MEDLINE}/{PubMed} (January 1990 to October 2017) search was conducted using the following keywords: betrixaban, {PRT}054021, {FXa} inhibitor, novel oral anticoagulant, {NOAC}, direct oral anticoagulant, {DOAC}, and target specific oral anticoagulant, {TSOAC}. References of identified articles were searched by hand for additional relevant citations. Study Selection and Data Extraction: We included English-language articles evaluating betrixaban pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety in human subjects for {VTE} prophylaxis. Data Synthesis: Betrixaban is a {FXa} inhibitor that decreases prothrombinase activity and thrombin generation. Betrixaban efficacy and safety has been compared with that of enoxaparin for prophylaxis of {VTE} in acutely ill medical patients. In the {APEX} trial and substudies, extended-duration betrixaban was superior in efficacy to standard-duration enoxaparin in patients at high risk for {VTE}, including those with elevated D-dimer levels (≥2× upper limit of normal) and of older age (≥75 years). Betrixaban is noninferior to enoxaparin in rates of major bleeding, but the former is associated with more clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events. Conclusion: Betrixaban is the first oral agent approved for extended-duration {VTE} prophylaxis in acutely ill hospitalized patients. Extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with betrixaban reduces the risk of {VTE} compared with standard-duration thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin but is associated with increased risk of bleeding.},

The virtual center then would predict the person's appearance and overall body health at a predetermined interval in the future, as well as provide feedback to the patient, engaging multiple senses and using an advanced body suit to represent changes in body mass and exercise tolerance as the person moves in the center. Pharmacists would work with the patient to identify patient-centered behavior changes, which would be programmed into the virtual center to demonstrate to the person how their new lifestyle goal may change their future appearance and health. Achievements and social networking in the virtual world would be incorporated to motivate patients to continue to make positive decisions regarding their health.

	abstract = {The renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}) is a prime target for cardiovascular drug therapy. Inhibition of the {RAS} lowers blood pressure and confers protection against cardiovascular and renal events. These latter benefits cannot be entirely attributed to blood pressure lowering. Angiotensinconverting enzyme ({ACE})-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ({ARBs}) have been studied extensively and, while there is irrefutable evidence that these agents mitigate the risk for cardiovascular and renal events, their protection is incomplete. In outcomes studies that have employed {ACE}-inhibitors or {ARBs} there has been a relatively high residual event rate in the treatment arm and this has been ascribed, by some, to the fact that neither {ACE}-inhibitors nor {ARBs} completely repress {RAS}. For this reason, combined {RAS} blockade with an {ACE}-inhibitor and {ARB} has emerged as a therapeutic option. In hypertension, combined {RAS} blockade elicits only a marginal incremental drop in blood pressure and it does not further lower the risk for cardiovascular events. In chronic heart failure and proteinuric renal disease, combining these agents in carefully selected patients is associated with a reduction in clinical events. Irrespective of the setting, dual {RAS} blockade is associated with an increase in the risk for adverse events, primarily hyperkalemia and worsening renal function. The emergence of the direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, has afforded clinicians a new strategy for {RAS} blockade. Renin system blockade with aliskiren plus another {RAS} agent is the subject of ongoing large-scale clinical trials and early studies suggest promise for this strategy. Currently, combined {RAS} blockade with an {ACE}-inhibitor and an {ARB} should not be routinely employed for hypertension; however, the combination of an {ACE}-inhibitor or {ARB} with aliskiren might be considered in some patients given the more formidable blood pressure-lowering profile of this regimen. In carefully selected patients with heart failure or kidney disease, combination therapy with two {RAS} inhibitors should be considered. © 2009 Expert Reviews Ltd.},

	abstract = {© 2018 The Author(s). Background: Incretin-based therapies including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ({DPP}-4) inhibitors and glucagon like peptide-1 ({GLP}-1) receptor agonists are novel medications for type 2 diabetes management. Several studies have found cardioprotective effects of incretin-based therapies; however, it remains unclear whether there is any difference in heart failure ({HF}) risk between the two incretin-based therapies ({DPP}-4 inhibitors and {GLP}-1 receptor agonists). We aimed to assess the risk of hospitalization due to {HF} with the use of {DPP}-4 inhibitors compared to {GLP}-1 receptor agonists. Methods: Using Truven Health Marketscan data, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with type 2 diabetes, who were newly initiated on {DPP}-4 inhibitors or {GLP}-1 agonists. Follow-up continued from drug initiation until the first occurrence of: {HF} hospitalization (primary outcome), discontinuation of therapy (i.e. no fill for 7 days), switch to the comparator, end of enrollment, or end of study (December 2013). Cox proportional hazards models with propensity-score-matching were used to compare the risk of {HF} hospitalization between {DPP}-4 inhibitors and {GLP}-1 agonists. Results: A total of 321,606 propensity score-matched patients were included in the analysis (n = 160,803 for {DPP}-4 inhibitors; n = 160,803 for {GLP}-1 agonists). After adjusting for baseline characteristics and disease risk factors, the use of {DPP}-4 inhibitors was associated with a 14\% decreased risk of {HF} hospitalization compared to {GLP}-1 agonists use [hazard ratio ({HR}), 0.86; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.83, 0.90]. The results were consistent in patients without baseline {HF} ({HR}, 0.85; 95\% {CI} 0.82, 0.89), but the association was not statistically significant for patients with baseline {HF} ({HR}, 0.90; 95\% {CI} 0.74, 1.07). Conclusion: In this retrospective matched cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes, the use of {DPP}-4 inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of {HF} hospitalization compared to {GLP}-1 agonists. However, the association was not statistically significant in patients who had {HF} prior to the use of {DPP}-4 inhibitors.},

We aimed to compare {HrQoL} measures in adults with apparent {TRH} ({aTRH}) and non-resistant hypertension among nationally representative {US} Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data pooled from 2000 to 2011. Cohorts compared were adults with {aTRH} (≥2 unique fills from ≥4 antihypertensive classes during a year) versus non-resistant hypertension (those with hypertension not meeting the {aTRH} definition). Key outcomes were cohort differences in {SF}-12v2 physical component summary ({PCS}) and mental component summary ({MCS}) scores and disease-state utility using the {SF}-6D. Of 57 150 adults with hypertension, 2501 (4.4\%) met criteria for {aTRH}. Persons with {aTRH}, compared with non-resistant hypertension, were older (mean, 68 vs 61 years), had a higher {BMI} (30.9 vs 29.7 kg m-2) and were more likely to be Black (20\% vs 14\%), but less likely to be female (46\% vs 54\%). Persons with {aTRH}, compared with non-resistant hypertension, had lower mean {PCS} scores (35.8 vs 43.2; P{\textless}0.0001), and utility (0.68 vs 0.74; P{\textless}0.0001), but similar {MCS} scores (49.1 vs 50.4). In multivariable-adjusted analyses, {aTRH} was associated with a 2.37 (95\% {CI} 1.71 to 3.02) lower {PCS} score and 0.02 (95\% {CI} 0.01 to 0.03) lower utility, compared with non-resistant hypertension. In conclusion, {aTRH} was associated with substantially lower {HrQoL} in physical functioning and health utility, but not in mental functioning, compared with non-resistant hypertension. The multivariable-adjusted reduction in physical functioning was similar in magnitude to previous observations comparing hypertension with no hypertension.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}: The clinical use of ambulatory blood pressure ({BP}) monitoring requires further validation in prospective outcome studies. {OBJECTIVE}: To compare the prognostic significance of conventional and ambulatory {BP} measurement in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension. {DESIGN}: Substudy to the double-blind placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial, started in October 1988 with follow up to February 1999. The conventional {BP} at randomization was the mean of 6 readings (2 measurements in the sitting position at 3 visits 1 month apart). The baseline ambulatory {BP} was recorded with a noninvasive intermittent technique. {SETTING}: Family practices and outpatient clinics at primary and secondary referral hospitals. {PARTICIPANTS}: A total of 808 older (aged {\textgreater} or =60 years) patients whose untreated {BP} level on conventional measurement at baseline was 160 to 219 mm Hg systolic and less than 95 mm Hg diastolic. {INTERVENTIONS}: For the overall study, patients were randomized to nitrendipine (n = 415; 10-40 mg/d) with the possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/d) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25.0 mg/d) or to matching placebos (n = 393). {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Total and cardiovascular mortality, all cardiovascular end points, fatal and nonfatal stroke, and fatal and nonfatal cardiac end points. {RESULTS}: After adjusting for sex, age, previous cardiovascular complications, smoking, and residence in western Europe, a 10-mm Hg higher conventional systolic {BP} at randomization was not associated with a worse prognosis, whereas in the placebo group, a 10-mm Hg higher 24-hour {BP} was associated with an increased relative hazard rate ({HR}) of most outcome measures (eg, {HR}, 1.23 [95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.00-1.50] for total mortality and 1.34 [95\% {CI}, 1.03-1.75] for cardiovascular mortality). In the placebo group, the nighttime systolic {BP} (12 {AM}-6 {AM}) more accurately predicted end points than the daytime level. Cardiovascular risk increased with a higher night-to-day ratio of systolic {BP} independent of the 24-hour {BP} (10\% increase in night-to-day ratio; {HR} for all cardiovascular end points, 1.41; 95\% {CI}, 1.03-1.94). At randomization, the cardiovascular risk conferred by a conventional systolic {BP} of 160 mm Hg was similar to that associated with a 24-hour daytime or nighttime systolic {BP} of 142 mm Hg (95\% {CI}, 128-156 mm Hg), 145 mm Hg (95\% {CI}, 126-164 mm Hg) or 132 mm Hg (95\% {CI}, 120-145 mm Hg), respectively. In the active treatment group, systolic {BP} at randomization did not significantly predict cardiovascular risk, regardless of the technique of {BP} measurement. {CONCLUSIONS}: In untreated older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, ambulatory systolic {BP} was a significant predictor of cardiovascular risk over and above conventional {BP}.},

Diabetes (vs. no diabetes) was moderately associated with death from cancers of the liver, pancreas, ovary, colorectum, lung, bladder, and breast. Aside from cancer and vascular disease, diabetes (vs. no diabetes) was also associated with death from renal disease, liver disease, pneumonia and other infectious diseases, mental disorders, nonhepatic digestive diseases, external causes, intentional self-harm, nervous-system disorders, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Hazard ratios were appreciably reduced after further adjustment for glycemia measures, but not after adjustment for systolic blood pressure, lipid levels, inflammation or renal markers. Fasting glucose levels exceeding 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter), but not levels of 70 to 100 mg per deciliter (3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter), were associated with death. A 50-year-old with diabetes died, on average, 6 years earlier than a counterpart without diabetes, with about 40\% of the difference in survival attributable to excess nonvascular deaths. {CONCLUSIONS}: In addition to vascular disease, diabetes is associated with substantial premature death from several cancers, infectious diseases, external causes, intentional self-harm, and degenerative disorders, independent of several major risk factors.

	abstract = {Management of hypertension in the elderly should take into account, in particular, the possible negative impact of antihypertensive drugs on the patient's quality of life, the deterioration of which may result in a loss of independence and reduced treatment compliance. Quality of life is recognised as a multifactorial variable and can be subdivided into different domains (symptomatic well-being, emotional, physical, work-social, cognitive and life satisfaction), which are generally explored by means of specific questionnaires or scales. When evaluating elderly patients with hypertension, it is necessary to pay particular attention to specific domains such as symptomatic well-being, cognitive function, activity and sexual function, which have already been diminished by the age itself and the disease. The results of some large trials that specifically evaluated the quality of life effects of long-term therapy of hypertension in older people (Medical Research Council's [{MRC}] Trial of Hypertension in Older Adults, Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program [{SHEP}], Systolic Hypertension in Europe [Syst-Eur], Study on {COgnition} and Prognosis in the Elderly [{SCOPE}]) have shown that antihypertensive treatment as a whole either had no negative impact on quality of life, or even produced some improvement. The question whether some classes of antihypertensive agents are more beneficial or harmful than others in terms of quality-of-life effects remains largely unanswered. Results from long-term trials suggest that treatment with diuretics is not associated with adverse effects on quality of life. Nevertheless, chlortalidone and other diuretics have been more often associated with sexual dysfunction in men, including decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and difficult ejaculation, than other drug classes. Nonselective lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as propranolol, have been reported to exert some negative effect on quality of life and have been associated with depression, impairment of memory function and adverse effects such as erectile problems. A less unfavourable impact has been described with beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists and those with vasodilating properties. Calcium channel antagonists have generally been associated with a positive effect on quality of life, although some trials have shown high rates of adverse effects and withdrawals, particularly with first-generation dihydropyridines. Concern has also been raised about the potential for adverse cognitive effects associated with the use of calcium channel antagonists, but studies on this topic are not univocal. {ACE} inhibitors have usually been reported to exert favourable effects on quality of life. These drugs seem to be effective in maintaining, or even improving, cognitive function through mechanisms other than blood pressure control. In addition, a number of studies reported favourable impact of {ACE} inhibitors on sexual function. Angiotensin {II} receptor antagonists have been associated with good tolerability and low withdrawal rate. They have been demonstrated not to interfere with or even improve cognitive function as well as sexual performance. Although no class of antihypertensive agents presents a clearly superior effect over the others in terms of quality of life, the current impression is that {ACE} inhibitors and angiotensin {II} receptor antagonists may offer some advantage, at least in regard to effects on cognitive function and sexual activity.},

	abstract = {Resistant hypertension affects an estimated 10-15 million American adults and is increasing in prevalence. The etiology of resistant hypertension is almost always multifactorial, including obesity, older age, high dietary salt, chronic kidney disease, and aldosterone excess. Classical primary aldosteronism and lesser degrees of aldosterone excess, possibly originating from visceral adipocytes, contribute broadly to antihypertensive treatment resistance. Treatment of resistant hypertension is predicated on appropriate lifestyle changes and use of effective combinations of antihypertensive agents from different classes. Blockade of aldosterone with spironolactone has been shown to be particularly effective for treatment of resistant hypertension. The antihypertensive benefit of spironolactone is not limited to patients with demonstrable hyperaldosteronism but instead can be effective in resistant hypertensive patients regardless of aldosterone levels. Chlorthalidone is a potent, long-acting thiazide-like diuretic and should be used preferentially to treat resistant hypertension as it is superior to normally used doses of hydrochlorothiazide.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Quantification of the disease burden caused by different risks informs prevention by providing an account of health loss different to that provided by a disease-by-disease analysis. No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time. {METHODS}: We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years ({DALYs}; sum of years lived with disability [{YLD}] and years of life lost [{YLL}]) attributable to the independent effects of 67 risk factors and clusters of risk factors for 21 regions in 1990 and 2010. We estimated exposure distributions for each year, region, sex, and age group, and relative risks per unit of exposure by systematically reviewing and synthesising published and unpublished data. We used these estimates, together with estimates of cause-specific deaths and {DALYs} from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, to calculate the burden attributable to each risk factor exposure compared with the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure. We incorporated uncertainty in disease burden, relative risks, and exposures into our estimates of attributable burden. {FINDINGS}: In 2010, the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure (7.0\% [95\% uncertainty interval 6.2-7.7] of global {DALYs}), tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6.3\% [5.5-7.0]), and alcohol use (5.5\% [5.0-5.9]). In 1990, the leading risks were childhood underweight (7.9\% [6.8-9.4]), household air pollution from solid fuels ({HAP}; 7.0\% [5.6-8.3]), and tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6.1\% [5.4-6.8]). Dietary risk factors and physical inactivity collectively accounted for 10.0\% (95\% {UI} 9.2-10.8) of global {DALYs} in 2010, with the most prominent dietary risks being diets low in fruits and those high in sodium. Several risks that primarily affect childhood communicable diseases, including unimproved water and sanitation and childhood micronutrient deficiencies, fell in rank between 1990 and 2010, with unimproved water and sanitation accounting for 0.9\% (0.4-1.6) of global {DALYs} in 2010. However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa childhood underweight, {HAP}, and non-exclusive and discontinued breastfeeding were the leading risks in 2010, while {HAP} was the leading risk in south Asia. The leading risk factor in Eastern Europe, most of Latin America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 was alcohol use; in most of Asia, North Africa and Middle East, and central Europe it was high blood pressure. Despite declines, tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke remained the leading risk in high-income north America and western Europe. High body-mass index has increased globally and it is the leading risk in Australasia and southern Latin America, and also ranks high in other high-income regions, North Africa and Middle East, and Oceania. {INTERPRETATION}: Worldwide, the contribution of different risk factors to disease burden has changed substantially, with a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children towards those for non-communicable diseases in adults. These changes are related to the ageing population, decreased mortality among children younger than 5 years, changes in cause-of-death composition, and changes in risk factor exposures. New evidence has led to changes in the magnitude of key risks including unimproved water and sanitation, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, and ambient particulate matter pollution. The extent to which the epidemiological shift has occurred and what the leading risks currently are varies greatly across regions. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risks are still those associated with poverty and those that affect children. {FUNDING}: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

Using the concept of treatment effect modification (also referred to as interaction), defined as a difference in treatment response between patient groups, we discuss whether and how treatment effects can be tailored to better meet patients' needs. {RESULTS}: First we argue that contrary to how most studies are designed, treatment effect modification should be expected. Second, given this expected heterogeneity, a small number of clinically relevant subgroups should be a priori selected, depending on the expected magnitude of effect modification, and prevalence of the patient type. Third, by defining generalizability as the absence of treatment effect modification we show that generalizability can be evaluated within the usual statistical framework of equivalence testing. Fourth, when equivalence cannot be confirmed, we address the need for further analyses and studies tailoring treatment towards groups of patients with similar response to treatment. Fifth, we argue that to properly frame, the entire body of evidence on effect modification should be quantified in a prior probability.},

	abstract = {Importance: Examining life expectancy by county allows for tracking geographic disparities over time and assessing factors related to these disparities. This information is potentially useful for policy makers, clinicians, and researchers seeking to reduce disparities and increase longevity. Objective: To estimate annual life tables by county from 1980 to 2014; describe trends in geographic inequalities in life expectancy and age-specific risk of death; and assess the proportion of variation in life expectancy explained by variation in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Design, Setting, and Participants: Annual county-level life tables were constructed using small area estimation methods from deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics ({NCHS}), and population counts from the {US} Census Bureau, {NCHS}, and the Human Mortality Database. Measures of geographic inequality in life expectancy and age-specific mortality risk were calculated. Principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression were used to examine the county-level association between life expectancy and socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Exposures: County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality risk. Results: Counties were combined as needed to create stable units of analysis over the period 1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed from 3142 to 3110. In 2014, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 79.1 (95\% uncertainty interval [{UI}], 79.0-79.1) years overall, but differed by 20.1 (95\% {UI}, 19.1-21.3) years between the counties with the lowest and highest life expectancy. Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy increased between 1980 and 2014. Over the same period, absolute geographic inequality in the risk of death decreased among children and adolescents, but increased among older adults. Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors explained 60\%, 74\%, and 27\% of county-level variation in life expectancy, respectively. Combined, these factors explained 74\% of this variation. Most of the association between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through behavioral and metabolic risk factors. Conclusions and Relevance: Geographic disparities in life expectancy among {US} counties are large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy among counties can be explained by a combination of socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities in life expectancy in the United States.},

Previous research identifying factors influencing adherence has focused primarily on broad, population-based approaches. Identifying specific barriers for an individual is more useful in designing meaningful targeted interventions. Using customized telephonic outreach, we examined specific patient-reported barriers influencing hypertensive patients' nonadherence to medication in order to identify targeted interventions.{\textbar}A telephone survey of 8692 nonadherent hypertensive patients was conducted. The patient sample comprised health plan members with at least two prescriptions for antihypertensive medications in 2008. The telephone script was based on the "target" drug associated with greatest nonadherence (medication possession ratio [{MPR}] {\textless}80\%) during the four-month period preceding the survey.{\textbar}The response rate was 28.2\% of the total sample, representing 63.8\% of commercial members and 37.2\% of Medicare members. Mean age was 63.4 years. Mean {MPR} was 61.0\% for the target drug. Only 58.2\% of Medicare respondents and 60.4\% of commercial respondents reported "missing a dose of medication". The primary reason given was "forgetfulness" (61.8\% Medicare, 60.8\% commercial), followed by "being too busy" (2.7\% Medicare, 18.5\% commercial) and "other reasons" (21.9\% Medicare, 8.1\% commercial) including travel, hospitalization/sickness, disruption of daily events, and inability to get to the pharmacy. Prescription copay was a barrier for less than 5\% of surveyed patients.{\textbar}Our findings indicate that events interfering with daily routine had a significant impact on adherence. Medication adherence appears to be a patterned behavior established through the creation of a routine and a reminder system for taking the medication. Providers should assess patients' daily schedules and medication-taking competency to develop and promote a medication routine.},

Sections of the guideline that have not been updated continue to stand, however, wherever {NICE} has subsequently issued new and related guidance relevant to existing recommendations, these have been identified and cross-referred to in this partial update, examples include interventions on lifestyle factors and public health policy recommendations such as smoking cessation, dietary salt restriction, alcohol intake and cardiovascular disease prevention and cardiovascular disease risk assessment. In addition, new {NICE} guidance developed in areas relevant to hypertension are also highlighted and cross referenced (for example, chronic kidney disease, stroke, diabetes and hypertension in pregnancy). The recommendations that have been reviewed in this partial update of the guideline for the clinical management of primary hypertension in adults, include; blood pressure measurement for the diagnosis of hypertension; blood pressure thresholds for intervention with drug therapy and blood pressure targets for treatment; specific aspects of the recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of hypertension; the treatment of hypertension in the very elderly (people aged greater than 80 years); dilemmas surrounding decision making for treatment of hypertension in younger adults (less than 40 years); the treatment of drug resistant hypertension; and wherever appropriate, the impact of age and ethnicity on treatment recommendations.},

	abstract = {A multicentre, double blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial of nifedipine, metoprolol, and nifedipine and metoprolol combined was conducted in a group of 338 patients with unstable angina not pretreated with a beta blocker and of nifedipine in 177 patients pretreated with a beta blocker. The main outcome event was recurrent ischaemia or myocardial infarction within 48 hours. Trial medication effects were expressed as ratios of event rates relative to placebo. In patients not pretreated with a beta blocker the event rate ratios with associated 95\% confidence intervals were 1.15 (0.83, 1.64) for nifedipine, 0.76 (0.49, 1.16) for metoprolol, and 0.80 (0.53, 1.19) for nifedipine and metoprolol combined. In patients already on a beta blocker the addition of nifedipine was beneficial (rate ratio 0.68 (0.47, 0.97). Equal numbers of patients developed myocardial infarction and reversible ischaemia. Most infarctions occurred early, within six hours of randomisation. In patients not already on a beta blocker the nifedipine rate ratio for infarction only was 1.51 (0.87, 2.74). These results suggest that in patients not on previous beta blockade metoprolol has a beneficial short term effect on unstable angina, that fixed combination with nifedipine provides no further gain, and that nifedipine may be detrimental. On the other hand, the addition of nifedipine to existing beta blockade when the patient's condition becomes unstable seems beneficial.},

We examined race-ethnic disparities in acute stroke performance metrics in a voluntary stroke registry among Florida and Puerto Rico Get With the Guidelines-Stroke hospitals. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Seventy-five sites in the Florida Puerto Rico Stroke Registry (66 Florida and 9 Puerto Rico) recorded 58 864 ischemic stroke cases (2010-2014). Logistic regression models examined racial-ethnic differences in acute stroke performance measures and defect-free care (intravenous tissue plasminogen activator treatment, in-hospital antithrombotic therapy, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, discharge antithrombotic therapy, appropriate anticoagulation therapy, statin use, smoking cessation counseling) and temporal trends. Among ischemic stroke cases, 63\% were non-Hispanic white ({NHW}), 18\% were non-Hispanic black ({NHB}), 14\% were Hispanic living in Florida, and 6\% were Hispanic living in Puerto Rico. {NHW} patients were the oldest, followed by Hispanics, and {NHBs}.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Answers to clinical and public health research questions increasingly require aggregated data from multiple sites. Data from electronic health records and other clinical sources are useful for such studies, but require stringent quality assessment. Data quality assessment is particularly important in multisite studies to distinguish true variations in care from data quality problems. {METHODS}: We propose a "fit-for-use" conceptual model for data quality assessment and a process model for planning and conducting single-site and multisite data quality assessments. These approaches are illustrated using examples from prior multisite studies. {APPROACH}: Critical components of multisite data quality assessment include: thoughtful prioritization of variables and data quality dimensions for assessment; development and use of standardized approaches to data quality assessment that can improve data utility over time; iterative cycles of assessment within and between sites; targeting assessment toward data domains known to be vulnerable to quality problems; and detailed documentation of the rationale and outcomes of data quality assessments to inform data users. The assessment process requires constant communication between site-level data providers, data coordinating centers, and principal investigators. {DISCUSSION}: A conceptually based and systematically executed approach to data quality assessment is essential to achieve the potential of the electronic revolution in health care. High-quality data allow "learning health care organizations" to analyze and act on their own information, to compare their outcomes to peers, and to address critical scientific questions from the population perspective.},

When data required according to the protocol were missing but trials were potentially eligible, we contacted researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and authorities. {ELIGIBILITY} {CRITERIA}: Randomised controlled trials including 100 or more people with diabetes mellitus, treated for 12 months or more, comparing any antihypertensive agent against placebo, two agents against one, or different blood pressure targets. {RESULTS}: 49 trials, including 73 738 participants, were included in the meta-analyses. Most of the participants had type 2 diabetes. If baseline systolic blood pressure was greater than 150 mm Hg, antihypertensive treatment reduced the risk of all cause mortality (relative risk 0.89, 95\% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.99), cardiovascular mortality (0.75, 0.57 to 0.99), myocardial infarction (0.74, 0.63 to 0.87), stroke (0.77, 0.65 to 0.91), and end stage renal disease (0.82, 0.71 to 0.94). If baseline systolic blood pressure was 140-150 mm Hg, additional treatment reduced the risk of all cause mortality (0.87, 0.78 to 0.98), myocardial infarction (0.84, 0.76 to 0.93), and heart failure (0.80, 0.66 to 0.97). If baseline systolic blood pressure was less than 140 mm Hg, however, further treatment increased the risk of cardiovascular mortality (1.15, 1.00 to 1.32), with a tendency towards an increased risk of all cause mortality (1.05, 0.95 to 1.16). Metaregression analyses showed a worse treatment effect with lower baseline systolic blood pressures for cardiovascular mortality (1.15, 1.03 to 1.29 for each 10 mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure) and myocardial infarction (1.12, 1.03 to 1.22 for each 10 mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure).

Our ultimate goal is to use data from electronic health records to predict the risk and timing of deterioration in hypertension control. Towards this goal, this work predicts the transition points at which hypertension is brought into, as well as pushed out of, control. {METHOD}: In a cohort of 1294 patients with hypertension enrolled in a chronic disease management program at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, patients are modeled as an array of features derived from the clinical domain over time, which are distilled into a core set using an information gain criteria regarding their predictive performance. A model for transition point prediction was then computed using a random forest classifier. {RESULTS}: The most predictive features for transitions in hypertension control status included hypertension assessment patterns, comorbid diagnoses, procedures and medication history. The final random forest model achieved a c-statistic of 0.836 (95\% {CI} 0.830 to 0.842) and an accuracy of 0.773 (95\% {CI} 0.766 to 0.780). {CONCLUSIONS}: This study achieved accurate prediction of transition points of hypertension control status, an important first step in the long-term goal of developing personalized hypertension management plans.},

	abstract = {Many studies have assessed short-term effects of weight loss on blood pressure, whereas little attention has been paid to long-term effects. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the long-term effects of weight loss on hypertension outcome measures in adults using literature published from 1966 to 2001. All prospective studies and trials, performed on participants with body mass index of {\textgreater} or =28 kg/m2 with a follow-up of {\textgreater}2 years and weight changes recorded, were included. The data from these studies were used to model the long-term effects on blood pressure. Previous reviews on shorter-term studies indicate a 1:1 drop in blood pressure (mm Hg) with weight loss (kilograms). Our findings, based on studies with follow-up of {\textgreater} or =2 years, demonstrate blood pressure decreases less than this after weight loss. The surgical intervention studies exhibited huge weight losses with undramatic blood pressures changes. When surgical interventions are excluded, the models suggest that for 10 kg weight loss, decreases of 4.6 mm Hg and 6.0 mm Hg in diastolic and systolic blood pressure, respectively, may be expected, about half of that predicted from the short-term trials. Initial blood pressure, the length of follow-up, medication changes, and physiological restrictions may contribute to this reduced effect in the long-term studies. Extrapolation of short-term blood pressure changes with weight loss to the longer term is potentially misleading. The weight/hypertension relationship is complex and needs well-conducted studies with long-term follow-up to examine the effects of weight loss on hypertension outcomes.},

According to a stringent random effects model, adherence is most strongly related to outcomes in studies of nonmedication regimens, where measures of adherence are continuous, and where the disease is chronic (particularly hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, intestinal disease, and sleep apnea). A less stringent fixed effects model shows a trend for higher adherence-outcome correlations in studies of less serious conditions, of pediatric patients, and in those studies using self-reports of adherence, multiple measures of adherence, and less specific measures of outcomes. Intercorrelations among moderator variables in multiple regression show that the best predictor of the adherence-outcome relationship is methodological-the sensitivity/quality of the adherence assessment.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Electronic Medical Records ({EMRs}) are increasingly used in the provision of primary care and have been compiled into databases which can be utilized for surveillance, research and informing practice. The primary purpose of these records is for the provision of individual patient care; validation and examination of underlying limitations is crucial for use for research and data quality improvement. This study examines and describes the validity of chronic disease case definition algorithms and factors affecting data quality in a primary care {EMR} database. {METHODS}: A retrospective chart audit of an age stratified random sample was used to validate and examine diagnostic algorithms applied to {EMR} data from the Manitoba Primary Care Research Network ({MaPCReN}), part of the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network ({CPCSSN}). The presence of diabetes, hypertension, depression, osteoarthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) was determined by review of the medical record and compared to algorithm identified cases to identify discrepancies and describe the underlying contributing factors. {RESULTS}: The algorithm for diabetes had high sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value ({PPV}) with all scores being over 90\%. Specificities of the algorithms were greater than 90\% for all conditions except for hypertension at 79.2\%. The largest deficits in algorithm performance included poor {PPV} for {COPD} at 36.7\% and limited sensitivity for {COPD}, depression and osteoarthritis at 72.0\%, 73.3\% and 63.2\% respectively. Main sources of discrepancy included missing coding, alternative coding, inappropriate diagnosis detection based on medications used for alternate indications, inappropriate exclusion due to comorbidity and loss of data. {CONCLUSIONS}: Comparison to medical chart review shows that at {MaPCReN} the {CPCSSN} case finding algorithms are valid with a few limitations. This study provides the basis for the validated data to be utilized for research and informs users of its limitations. Analysis of underlying discrepancies provides the ability to improve algorithm performance and facilitate improved data quality.},

However, small private offices often lack the resources to hire a clinical pharmacist for their office. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a centralized, web-based {CV} risk service ({CVRS}) managed by clinical pharmacists will improve guideline adherence in primary care medical offices in rural and small communities. {METHODS}: This study is a cluster randomized prospective trial in 12 primary care offices. Medical offices were randomized to either the {CVRS} intervention or usual care. The intervention will last for 12months and all subjects will have research visits at baseline and 12months.

In normal hearts, pacing-induced tachycardia at a rate of 250 beats/min does not alter coronary reserve in the outer half of the left ventricular wall. Pacing produces a linear decrease in coronary reserve in the inner half, although the decrease is attenuated if perfusion pressure is elevated, as in systemic hypertension. Strenuous exercise can quadruple coronary flow, but modest coronary flow reserve is preserved in normal hearts. Whether this occurs when there is ventricular hypertrophy is unknown and requires study. The concept of coronary flow reserve is important to the understanding of pathophysiology, but data must be interpreted with caution because pharmacologic agents may produce more vasodilatation than can be attained by endogenous stimuli, even when there is marked ischemia.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Combination therapy, specifically with aspirin, cholesterol and blood pressure-lowering drugs, substantially reduces the risk of coronary heart disease, but the full preventive effect is only realized if treatment continues indefinitely. Our objective was to provide a summary estimate of adherence to drugs that prevent coronary heart disease, according to drug class and use in people who have had a myocardial infarction (secondary prevention) and people who have not (primary prevention). {METHODS}: A meta-analysis of data on 376,162 patients from 20 studies assessing adherence using prescription refill frequency for the following 7 drug classes was performed: aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, thiazides, and statins. Meta-regression was used to examine the effects of age, payment, and treatment duration. {RESULTS}: The summary estimate for adherence across all studies was 57\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 50-64) after a median of 24 months. There were statistically significant differences in adherence between primary and secondary prevention: 50\% ({CI}, 45-56) and 66\% ({CI}, 56-75), respectively (P=.012). Adherence was lower for thiazides (42\%) than for angiotensin receptor blockers (61\%) in primary prevention (P=.02). There were no other statistically significant differences between any of the drug classes in primary or secondary prevention studies. Adherence decreased by 0.15\% points/month (P=.07) and was unrelated to age or whether patients paid for their pills. {CONCLUSION}: Adherence to preventive treatment is poor and little related to class of drug, suggesting that side effects are not the main cause. General, rather than class-specific, measures at improving adherence are needed.},

Regarding variability in systolic blood pressure response to change in sodium intake, with higher versus lower sodium levels (78-mmol sodium difference), the range of systolic blood pressure change was -32 to +17 mm Hg; 33.5\% decreased {\textgreater} or =10 mm Hg. Regarding consistency of response, systolic blood pressure change with run-in versus lower sodium was modestly correlated with systolic blood pressure change with higher versus medium sodium; systolic blood pressure change with higher versus lower sodium was similarly correlated with run-in versus medium sodium (combined Spearman r=0.27, P=0.002). These results show low-order consistency of response and confirm that identifying individuals as sodium responders is difficult. They support current recommendations for lower salt intake directed at the general public rather than "susceptible" individuals as one of several strategies to prevent and control adverse blood pressures widely prevalent in the adult population.},

During the study period, the office visit blood pressure measurement target was 130/80 mm Hg and the home measurement target was 120/75 mm Hg. Control patients received usual care consisting of seeing their health care clinician for routine blood pressure measurement and adjustment of medication if necessary. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: The primary outcome was the difference in systolic blood pressure between intervention and control groups at the 12-month office visit. {RESULTS}: Primary outcome data were available from 450 patients (81\%). The mean baseline blood pressure was 143.1/80.5 mm Hg in the intervention group and 143.6/79.5 mm Hg in the control group.

Studies were selected if they reported at least 1 of the following outcomes: cardiac death, myocardial infarction, study withdrawal due to adverse events, angina frequency, nitroglycerin use, or exercise duration. Ninety (63\%) of 143 identified studies met the inclusion criteria. {DATA} {EXTRACTION}: Two independent reviewers extracted data from selected articles, settling any differences by consensus. Outcome data were extracted a third time by 1 of the investigators. We combined results using odds ratios ({ORs}) for discrete data and mean differences for continuous data. Studies of calcium antagonists were grouped by duration and type of drug (nifedipine vs nonnifedipine). {DATA} {SYNTHESIS}: Rates of cardiac death and myocardial infarction were not significantly different for treatment with beta-blockers vs calcium antagonists ({OR}, 0.97; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.67-1.38; P = .79). There were 0.31 (95\% {CI}, 0.00-0.62; P = .05) fewer episodes of angina per week with beta-blockers than with calcium antagonists. beta-Blockers were discontinued because of adverse events less often than were calcium antagonists ({OR}, 0.72; 95\% {CI}, 0.60-0.86; P{\textless}.001). The differences between beta-blockers and calcium antagonists were most striking for nifedipine ({OR} for adverse events with beta-blockers vs nifedipine, 0.60; 95\% {CI}, 0.47-0.77). Too few trials compared nitrates with calcium antagonists or beta-blockers to draw firm conclusions about relative efficacy. {CONCLUSIONS}: beta-Blockers provide similar clinical outcomes and are associated with fewer adverse events than calcium antagonists in randomized trials of patients who have stable angina.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Health information technologies can assist clinicians in the Intensive Care Unit ({ICU}) by providing additional analysis of patient stability. However, because patient diagnoses can be confounded by chronic alcohol use, the predictive value of existing systems is suboptimal. Through the use of Electronic Health Records ({EHR}), we have developed computer software called {AutoTriage} to generate accurate predictions through multi-dimensional analysis of clinical variables. We analyze the performance of {AutoTriage} on the Alcohol Use Disorder ({AUD}) subpopulation in this study, and build on results we reported for {AutoTriage} performance on the general population in previous work. {METHODS}: {AUD}-related {ICD}-9 codes were used to obtain a patient population from {MIMIC} {III} {ICU} dataset for a retrospective study. Patient mortality risk score is generated through analysis of eight {EHR}-based clinical variables. The score is determined by combining weighted subscores, each of which are obtained from singlets, doublets or triplets of one or more of the eight continuous-valued clinical variable inputs. A temporally updating risk score is computed with a continuously revised 12-hour mortality prediction. {RESULTS}: Among {AUD} patients, in a non-overlapping test set, {AutoTriage} outperforms existing systems with an Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic ({AUROC}) value of 0.934 for 12-h mortality prediction. At a sensitivity of 90\%, {AutoTriage} achieves a specificity of 80\%, positive predictive value of 40\%, negative predictive value of 89\%, and an Odds Ratio of 36. {CONCLUSIONS}: For mortality prediction, {AutoTriage} demonstrates improvements in both the accuracy and the Odds Ratio over current systems among the {AUD} patient population.},

	abstract = {There exists a growing literature on the estimation of gamma distributed multiplicative shared frailty models. There is, however, often a need to model more complicated frailty structures, but attempts to extend gamma frailties run into complications. Motivated by hip replacement data with a more complicated dependence structure, we propose a model based on multiplicative frailties with a multivariate log-normal joint distribution. We give a justification and an estimation procedure for this generally structured frailty model, which is a generalization of the one presented by {McGilchrist} (1993, Biometrics 49, 221-225). The estimation is based on Laplace approximation of the likelihood function. This leads to estimating equations based on a penalized fixed effects partial likelihood, where the marginal distribution of the frailty terms determines the penalty term. The tuning parameters of the penalty function, i.e., the frailty variances, are estimated by maximizing an approximate profile likelihood. The performance of the approximation is evaluated by simulation, and the frailty model is fitted to the hip replacement data.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Knowledge of the number of deaths caused by risk factors is needed for health policy and priority setting. Our aim was to estimate the mortality effects of the following 12 modifiable dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors in the United States ({US}) using consistent and comparable methods: high blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}) cholesterol, and blood pressure; overweight-obesity; high dietary trans fatty acids and salt; low dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids (seafood), and fruits and vegetables; physical inactivity; alcohol use; and tobacco smoking. {METHODS} {AND} {FINDINGS}: We used data on risk factor exposures in the {US} population from nationally representative health surveys and disease-specific mortality statistics from the National Center for Health Statistics. We obtained the etiological effects of risk factors on disease-specific mortality, by age, from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiological studies that had adjusted (i) for major potential confounders, and (ii) where possible for regression dilution bias. We estimated the number of disease-specific deaths attributable to all non-optimal levels of each risk factor exposure, by age and sex. In 2005, tobacco smoking and high blood pressure were responsible for an estimated 467,000 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 436,000-500,000) and 395,000 (372,000-414,000) deaths, accounting for about one in five or six deaths in {US} adults. Overweight-obesity (216,000; 188,000-237,000) and physical inactivity (191,000; 164,000-222,000) were each responsible for nearly 1 in 10 deaths. High dietary salt (102,000; 97,000-107,000), low dietary omega-3 fatty acids (84,000; 72,000-96,000), and high dietary trans fatty acids (82,000; 63,000-97,000) were the dietary risks with the largest mortality effects. Although 26,000 (23,000-40,000) deaths from ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes were averted by current alcohol use, they were outweighed by 90,000 (88,000-94,000) deaths from other cardiovascular diseases, cancers, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, alcohol use disorders, road traffic and other injuries, and violence. {CONCLUSIONS}: Smoking and high blood pressure, which both have effective interventions, are responsible for the largest number of deaths in the {US}. Other dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors for chronic diseases also cause a substantial number of deaths in the {US}.},

	abstract = {{AIM}: Patients with resistant hypertension are at high risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Efforts have been focused on lowering the surrogate endpoint of blood pressure ({BP}) with scant focus on reduction of hard cardiovascular endpoints. However, whether or not intensive lipid lowering is beneficial for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in this high-risk cohort is not known. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We evaluated 10 001 patients with coronary artery disease and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level {\textless}130 mg/{dL}, randomized to atorvastatin 80 vs. 10 mg, enrolled in the Treating to New Targets trial. Treatment-resistant hypertension ({TRH}) was defined as {BP} {\textgreater}/=140 {mmHg} despite being on three antihypertensive agents or {\textless}140 {mmHg} on four or more agents. Subjects were followed up for a median duration of 4.9 years. The primary outcome was major cardiovascular events (composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction ({MI}), fatal coronary heart disease ({CHD}), resuscitated cardiac arrest, and stroke). Among the 10 001 patients in the trial, 1112 (11.1\%) patients had {TRH}. Atorvastatin 80 mg, in patients with {TRH}, was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of the primary outcome ({HR} = 0.70; 95\% {CI} 0.52-0.93; P = 0.01), driven largely by a significant reduction in {CHD} deaths ({HR} = 0.55; 95\% {CI} 0.32-0.97; P = 0.04). In addition, atorvastatin 80 mg was associated with a reduction in major coronary events ({HR} = 0.67; 95\% {CI} 0.49-0.93; P = 0.02), and any cardiovascular or coronary event and with a trend (P = 0.05) towards reduction in all-cause mortality ({HR} = 0.68; 95\% {CI} 0.46-1.01) when compared with atorvastatin 10 mg. The results were similar when analysed for the two separate components of the {TRH} cohort. {CONCLUSION}: In subjects with {TRH}, intensive lipid lowering with atorvastatin 80 mg is associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular events.},

	abstract = {The objective was to assess persistence with antihypertensive therapy ({AHT}) and discontinuation patterns in patients newly dispensed different antihypertensive drug classes in a natural Canadian population-based setting. Hypertensive patients initiating {AHT} monotherapy were included in this 3-year retrospective cohort study (N=21 326) using the Saskatchewan health-care databases. Persistence was defined as consistently refilling a new prescription for {AHT} within 90 days of a previous dispensing. New courses of {AHT} were also documented in nonpersistent patients. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to compare persistence and new courses of therapy across initial drugs. Compared to the newer angiotensin {II} antagonists ({AIIAs}), the likelihood of discontinuing therapy over the 39-month study period was significantly higher for angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors ({HR}=1.29; 95\% {CI}=1.16-1.43), calcium channel blockers ({HR}=1.42; 95\% {CI}=1.27-1.60), beta blockers ({HR}=1.62; 95\% {CI}=1.45-1.80) and diuretics ({HR}=1.92; 95\% {CI}=1.73-2.14). In the year following treatment discontinuation, between 54 and 75\% of patients initiated a second course of treatment. Patients initiated on an {AIIA} had a significantly higher likelihood of starting a new course of therapy after a first treatment discontinuation, compared to all other agents. In conclusion, hypertensive patients initiated on an {AIIA} not only had greater persistence to {AHT} but were also more likely to initiate a new course of {AHT} after discontinuation than those initiating treatment with other agents. Further studies are required that relate intermittent treatment behaviours to health outcomes and costs in hypertension.},

	abstract = {During the past decade, our understanding of the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease ({CAD}) has undergone a remarkable evolution. We review here how these advances have altered our concepts of and clinical approaches to both the chronic and acute phases of {CAD}. Previously considered a cholesterol storage disease, we currently view atherosclerosis as an inflammatory disorder. The appreciation of arterial remodeling (compensatory enlargement) has expanded attention beyond stenoses evident by angiography to encompass the biology of nonstenotic plaques. Revascularization effectively relieves ischemia, but we now recognize the need to attend to nonobstructive lesions as well. Aggressive management of modifiable risk factors reduces cardiovascular events and should accompany appropriate revascularization. We now recognize that disruption of plaques that may not produce critical stenoses causes many acute coronary syndromes ({ACS}). The disrupted plaque represents a "solid-state" stimulus to thrombosis. Alterations in circulating prothrombotic or antifibrinolytic mediators in the "fluid phase" of the blood can also predispose toward {ACS}. Recent results have established the multiplicity of "high-risk" plaques and the widespread nature of inflammation in patients prone to develop {ACS}. These findings challenge our traditional view of coronary atherosclerosis as a segmental or localized disease. Thus, treatment of {ACS} should involve 2 overlapping phases: first, addressing the culprit lesion, and second, aiming at rapid "stabilization" of other plaques that may produce recurrent events. The concept of "interventional cardiology" must expand beyond mechanical revascularization to embrace preventive interventions that forestall future events.},

The 10-year cumulative incidence of cardiovascular disease in subjects 35 to 64 years of age who had high-normal blood pressure was 4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 5 percent) for women and 8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 10 percent) for men; in older subjects (those 65 to 90 years old), the incidence was 18 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 23 percent) for women and 25 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 34 percent) for men. As compared with optimal blood pressure, high-normal blood pressure was associated with a risk-factor-adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular disease of 2.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.1) in women and 1.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.2) in men. {CONCLUSIONS}: High-normal blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

In contrast, the use of home {BP} measurement improves measurement precision and reproducibility. However, data about its prognostic value are lacking. {OBJECTIVE}: To assess the prognostic value of home vs office {BP} measurement by general practitioners in a European population of elderly patients being treated for hypertension. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: Office and home {BP} and cardiac risk factors were measured at baseline in a cohort of 4939 treated hypertensive patients (mean age, 70 [{SD}, 6.5] years; 48.9\% men) who were recruited and followed up by their usual general practitioners without specific recommendations about their management. The cohort was then followed up for a mean of 3.2 ({SD}, 0.5) years. The thresholds defining uncontrolled hypertension were at least 140/90 mm Hg for office {BP} and 135/85 mm Hg for home {BP}. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The primary end point was cardiovascular mortality. Secondary end points were total mortality and the combination of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, transient ischemic attack, hospitalization for angina or heart failure, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. {RESULTS}: At the end of follow-up, clinical status was known for 99.9\% of patients. At least 1 cardiovascular event had occurred in 324 (incidence, 22.2/1000 patient-years). For {BP} self-measurement at home, each 10-mm Hg increase in systolic {BP} increased the risk of a cardiovascular event by 17.2\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 11.0\%-23.8\%) and each 5-mm Hg increase in diastolic {BP} increased that risk by 11.7\% (95\% {CI}, 5.7\%-18.1\%). Conversely, for the same increase in {BP} observed using office measurement, there was no significant increase in the risk of a cardiovascular event. In a multivariable model with patients having controlled hypertension (normal home and office {BP}) as the referent, the hazard ratio of cardiovascular events was 1.96 (95\% {CI}, 1.27-3.02) in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (high {BP} with both measurement methods), 2.06 (95\% {CI}, 1.22-3.47) in patients with normal office {BP} and elevated home {BP}, and 1.18 (95\% {CI}, 0.67-2.10) in patients with elevated office {BP} and normal home {BP}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings suggest that home {BP} measurement has a better prognostic accuracy than office {BP} measurement. Blood pressure should systematically be measured at home in patients receiving treatment for hypertension.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Medication nonadherence is a major cause of uncontrolled hypertension, but clinicians are poor at judging adherence, and the gold standard for measuring adherence, electronic monitoring, is rarely available in clinical settings. Self-report questionnaires ({SRQs}), by contrast, are inexpensive, easy to administer, and hence, may be useful for 'diagnosing' nonadherence. In this study, we evaluated the validity of two commonly used medication adherence {SRQs} among patients with uncontrolled hypertension, using electronic pillbox measurement as the gold standard. {METHODS}: A total of 149 patients with uncontrolled hypertension had adherence to their antihypertensive medication regimen monitored using a four-compartment electronic pillbox ({MedSignals}) between two primary care visits (median 50 days). Participants completed the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale ({MMAS}-8) and the Visual Analog Scale ({VAS}) at the second visit. Likelihood ratios were calculated using less than 80\% correct dosing adherence by electronic measurement as the gold standard. {RESULTS}: {SRQ} scores indicating low adherence ({MMAS}-8 {\textless}6 and {VAS} {\textless}80\%, 23 and 9\% of participants, respectively) had likelihood ratios of 2.00 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.10-3.65] and 7.72 (95\% {CI} 1.77-33.6), respectively, for detecting nonadherence compared to electronic measurement. {SRQ} scores indicating highest adherence ({MMAS}-8 = 8 and {VAS} = 100\%, 43 and 61\% of participants, respectively) had likelihood ratios of 0.55 (95\% {CI} 0.35-0.85) and 0.76 (95\% {CI} 0.57-1.01), respectively, for detecting nonadherence. {CONCLUSION}: The {MMAS}-8 and {VAS} are modestly useful in identifying antihypertensive medication nonadherence. Other tools, including electronic measurement, may be needed to guide titration of antihypertensive medications among patients with uncontrolled hypertension.},

	abstract = {Activation of renal sympathetic nerves is key to pathogenesis of essential hypertension. We aimed to assess effectiveness and safety of catheter-based renal denervation for reduction of blood pressure in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension.{\textbar}In this multicentre, prospective, randomised trial, patients who had a baseline systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or more (≥150 mm Hg for patients with type 2 diabetes), despite taking three or more antihypertensive drugs, were randomly allocated in a one-to-one ratio to undergo renal denervation with previous treatment or to maintain previous treatment alone (control group) at 24 participating centres. Randomisation was done with sealed envelopes. Data analysers were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary effectiveness endpoint was change in seated office-based measurement of systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Primary analysis included all patients remaining in follow-up at 6 months. This trial is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}00888433.{\textbar}106 (56\%) of 190 patients screened for eligibility were randomly allocated to renal denervation (n=52) or control (n=54) groups between June 9, 2009, and Jan 15, 2010. 49 (94\%) of 52 patients who underwent renal denervation and 51 (94\%) of 54 controls were assessed for the primary endpoint at 6 months. Office-based blood pressure measurements in the renal denervation group reduced by 32/12 mm Hg ({SD} 23/11, baseline of 178/96 mm Hg, p{\textless}0·0001), whereas they did not differ from baseline in the control group (change of 1/0 mm Hg [21/10], baseline of 178/97 mm Hg, p=0·77 systolic and p=0·83 diastolic). Between-group differences in blood pressure at 6 months were 33/11 mm Hg (p{\textless}0·0001). At 6 months, 41 (84\%) of 49 patients who underwent renal denervation had a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more, compared with 18 (35\%) of 51 controls (p{\textless}0·0001). We noted no serious procedure-related or device-related complications and occurrence of adverse events did not differ between groups; one patient who had renal denervation had possible progression of an underlying atherosclerotic lesion, but required no treatment.{\textbar}Catheter-based renal denervation can safely be used to substantially reduce blood pressure in treatment-resistant hypertensive patients.{\textbar}Ardian.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The results of angiographic studies have suggested that calcium channel-blocking agents may prevent new coronary lesion formation, the progression of minimal lesions, or both. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: The Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial ({PREVENT}) was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial designed to test whether amlodipine would slow the progression of early coronary atherosclerosis in 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. The primary outcome was the average 36-month angiographic change in mean minimal diameters of segments with a baseline diameter stenosis of 30\%. A secondary hypothesis was whether amlodipine would reduce the rate of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries as assessed with B-mode ultrasonography, which measured intimal-medial thicknesses ({IMT}). The rates of clinical events were also monitored. The placebo and amlodipine groups had nearly identical average 36-month reductions in the minimal diameter: 0.084 versus 0.095 mm, respectively (P:=0.38). In contrast, amlodipine had a significant effect in slowing the 36-month progression of carotid artery atherosclerosis: the placebo group experienced a 0.033-mm increase in {IMT}, whereas there was a 0. 0126-mm decrease in the amlodipine group (P:=0.007). There was no treatment difference in the rates of all-cause mortality or major cardiovascular events, although amlodipine use was associated with fewer cases of unstable angina and coronary revascularization. {CONCLUSIONS}: Amlodipine has no demonstrable effect on angiographic progression of coronary atherosclerosis or the risk of major cardiovascular events but is associated with fewer hospitalizations for unstable angina and revascularization.},

Relations between electrolyte excretion and blood pressure were studied in individual subjects within each centre and the results of these regression analyses pooled for all 52 centres. Relations between population median electrolyte values and population blood pressure values were also analysed across the 52 centres. Sodium excretion ranged from 0.2 mmol/24 h (Yanomamo Indians, Brazil) to 242 mmol/24 h (north China). In individual subjects (within centres) it was significantly related to blood pressure. Four centres found very low sodium excretion, low blood pressure, and little or no upward slope of blood pressure with age. Across the other 48 centres sodium was significantly related to the slope of blood pressure with age but not to median blood pressure or prevalence of high blood pressure. Potassium excretion was negatively correlated with blood pressure in individual subjects after adjustment for confounding variables. Across centres there was no consistent association. The relation of sodium to potassium ratio to blood pressure followed a pattern similar to that of sodium. Body mass index and heavy alcohol intake had strong, significant independent relations with blood pressure in individual subjects.},

	abstract = {Immortal time is a span of cohort follow-up during which, because of exposure definition, the outcome under study could not occur. Bias from immortal time was first identified in the 1970s in epidemiology in the context of cohort studies of the survival benefit of heart transplantation. It recently resurfaced in pharmaco-epidemiology, with several observational studies reporting that various medications can be extremely effective at reducing morbidity and mortality. These studies, while using different cohort designs, all involved some form of immortal time and the corresponding bias. In this paper, the author describes various cohort study designs leading to this bias, quantifies its magnitude under different survival distributions, and illustrates it by using data from a cohort of lung cancer patients. The author shows that for time-based, event-based, and exposure-based cohort definitions, the bias in the rate ratio resulting from misclassified or excluded immortal time increases proportionately to the duration of immortal time. The bias is more pronounced with a decreasing hazard function for the outcome event, as illustrated with the Weibull distribution compared with a constant hazard from the exponential distribution. In conclusion, observational studies of drug benefit in which computerized databases are used must be designed and analyzed properly to avoid immortal time bias.},

We evaluated the safety and feasibility of transplanting autologous myoblasts into infarcted myocardium of patients undergoing concurrent coronary artery bypass grafting ({CABG}) or left ventricular assist device ({LVAD}) implantation. In addition, we sought to gain preliminary information on graft survival and any associated changes in cardiac function. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Thirty patients with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy participated in a phase I, nonrandomized, multicenter pilot study of autologous skeletal myoblast transplantation concurrent with {CABG} or {LVAD} implantation. Twenty-four patients with a history of previous myocardial infarction and a left ventricular ejection fraction {\textless}40\% were enrolled in the {CABG} arm. In a second arm, 6 patients underwent {LVAD} implantation as a bridge to heart transplantation, and patients donated their explanted native hearts for testing at the time of heart transplantation. Myoblasts were successfully transplanted in all patients without any acute injection-related complications or significant long-term, unexpected adverse events. Follow-up positron emission tomography scans showed new areas of glucose uptake within the infarct scar in {CABG} patients. Echocardiography measured an average change in left ventricular ejection fraction from 28\% to 35\% at 1 year and of 36\% at 2 years. Histological evaluation in 4 of 6 patients who underwent heart transplantation documented survival and engraftment of the skeletal myoblasts within the infarcted myocardium. {CONCLUSIONS}: These results demonstrate the survival, feasibility, and safety of autologous myoblast transplantation and suggest that this modality offers a potential therapeutic treatment for end-stage heart disease.},

A new implantable device (Rheos system, {CVRx}, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota) that activates the carotid baroreflex may help these patients. {METHODS}: Forty-five subjects with systolic blood pressure {\textgreater}/=160 mm Hg or diastolic {\textgreater}/=90 mm Hg despite at least 3 antihypertensive drugs were enrolled in a prospective, nonrandomized feasibility study to assess whether Rheos therapy could safely lower blood pressure. Subjects were followed up for as long as 2 years. An external programmer was used to optimize and individualize efficacy. {RESULTS}: Baseline mean blood pressure was 179/105 mm Hg and heart rate was 80 beats/min, with a median of 5 antihypertensive drugs. After 3 months of device therapy, mean blood pressure was reduced by 21/12 mm Hg. This result was sustained in 17 subjects who completed 2 years of follow-up, with a mean reduction of 33/22 mm Hg.

There have been no data so far about the prevalence of {PH} in Central Europe. Therefore, we have undertaken this study to evaluate the prevalence of {PH} in patients with moderate to severe hypertension referred to a hypertension unit in the Czech Republic, together with the determination of the percentage of different subtypes of {PH} including familial forms. In addition to that, we have evaluated the prevalence of other types of secondary forms of hypertension.A total of 402 consecutive patients (230 females and 172 males) with hypertension, referred to our hypertension unit, were studied. Positive aldosterone/renin ratio ({ARR}, (ng/100 ml)/(ng/ml/h)) {\textgreater}/=50 as a more strict marker of {PH} was found in 87 patients (21.6\%), 30\% of them were normokalaemic. The diagnosis of {PH} was later confirmed in 77 cases (89\%); the total prevalence of {PH} was thus 19\%. {PH} consisted of the following forms: idiopathic hyperaldosteronism 42\%, unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma 36\%, unilateral hyperplasia 7\%, nonclassifiable {PH} (refused operation/adrenal venous sampling) 13\%, familial hyperaldosteronism type 1.2\%. The prevalence of other types of secondary hypertension was as follows: pheochromocytoma 5\%, renovascular 4.5\%, hypercortisolism 2\%, renal 0.75\%. In conclusion, we have noted that {PH} in the Central Europe region (Czech Republic) is the most frequent form of endocrine hypertension with a considerably high prevalence in moderate to severe hypertension. Application of more strict criteria raises the probability of correct diagnosis of {PH} including the early normokalaemic stages of {PH}.},

	abstract = {Unlike the brain, oxygen extraction for the heart is almost maximal at rest, so lowering coronary filling pressure ({DBP}) below the lower limit of autoregulation with antihypertensive drugs can lead to myocardial ischemia. This situation is exacerbated by the presence of coronary stenosis, which if more than 85\% means that coronary flow reserve is virtually zero (particularly in the presence of {LVH}). Such patients experience a fall in coronary flow and ischemia when {DBP} is acutely lowered to less than the mid-80s. Ischemic episodes on the 24-hour Holter monitor in treated hypertensives are often immediately preceded by a hypotensive episode. The "J-curve" debate has been going for over 20 years. Those that deny a J-curve relationship between treated {DBP} and myocardial infarction ({MI}) quote the continuous {DBP}/{MI} relationship seen in the large cohort of {MRFIT} screenees (with ischemic patients weeded out). However, the actual {MRFIT} (and similar {HDFP}) study patients with abnormal {ECGs} (ischemia or {LVH}), in contrast to those with normal {ECGs}, in the special-care group experienced an excess of coronary events associated with a {DBP} 5 {mmHg} lower than the referred-care group. Other studies, including the prospective {HOT} study, have indicated that ischemic hypertensives gain optimal results when {DBP} is lowered to the mid- to low 80s; below this level, the frequency of {MI} increases. This treatment-induced J-curve should not be confused with Nature's untreated J-curve, which results from the association of a low {DBP} (wide pulse-pressure) due to aging, noncompliant arteries, and an increasing frequency of ischemic events. A reasonable conclusion from most treatment studies (including {HOT}) is that in nonischemic hypertensives there is little point in lowering {DBP} below the mid- to low 80s in terms of {MI} prevention--though it is safe to do so. In contrast, ischemic hypertensives should not have their {DBP} lowered to less than the mid- to low 80s for fear of increasing the risk of {MI}.},

The intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.72 and 0.89 for systolic and diastolic pressure, respectively. {SBPM} is concordant with {ABPM} in classifying subjects as hypertensive or normotensive in 87\% of cases (kappa=0.56). The coefficient of variation of {SBPM} compared with {ABPM} was 5\%. In answer to a direct question 81\% of subjects preferred {SBPM} to {ABPM}. The current self-monitoring schedule recommended by the {ESH}, {AHA} and {ASH} is valid. The mean {BP} obtained from {SBPM} is equivalent to awake-time {BP} on {ABPM}, the accepted reference standard for 'out of office' {BP} measurement. {SBPM} is simpler to carry out, preferred by patients and should be considered on a par with {ABPM}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Data for trends in glycaemia and diabetes prevalence are needed to understand the effects of diet and lifestyle within populations, assess the performance of interventions, and plan health services. No consistent and comparable global analysis of trends has been done. We estimated trends and their uncertainties in mean fasting plasma glucose ({FPG}) and diabetes prevalence for adults aged 25 years and older in 199 countries and territories. {METHODS}: We obtained data from health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (370 country-years and 2.7 million participants). We converted systematically between different glycaemic metrics. For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean {FPG} and its uncertainty by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally, subnationally, or community representative. {FINDINGS}: In 2008, global age-standardised mean {FPG} was 5.50 mmol/L (95\% uncertainty interval 5.37-5.63) for men and 5.42 mmol/L (5.29-5.54) for women, having risen by 0.07 mmol/L and 0.09 mmol/L per decade, respectively. Age-standardised adult diabetes prevalence was 9.8\% (8.6-11.2) in men and 9.2\% (8.0-10.5) in women in 2008, up from 8.3\% (6.5-10.4) and 7.5\% (5.8-9.6) in 1980. The number of people with diabetes increased from 153 (127-182) million in 1980, to 347 (314-382) million in 2008. We recorded almost no change in mean {FPG} in east and southeast Asia and central and eastern Europe. Oceania had the largest rise, and the highest mean {FPG} (6.09 mmol/L, 5.73-6.49 for men; 6.08 mmol/L, 5.72-6.46 for women) and diabetes prevalence (15.5\%, 11.6-20.1 for men; and 15.9\%, 12.1-20.5 for women) in 2008. Mean {FPG} and diabetes prevalence in 2008 were also high in south Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and central Asia, north Africa, and the Middle East. Mean {FPG} in 2008 was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, east and southeast Asia, and high-income Asia-Pacific. In high-income subregions, western Europe had the smallest rise, 0.07 mmol/L per decade for men and 0.03 mmol/L per decade for women; North America had the largest rise, 0.18 mmol/L per decade for men and 0.14 mmol/L per decade for women. {INTERPRETATION}: Glycaemia and diabetes are rising globally, driven both by population growth and ageing and by increasing age-specific prevalences. Effective preventive interventions are needed, and health systems should prepare to detect and manage diabetes and its sequelae. {FUNDING}: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation and {WHO}.},

	abstract = {Predictive models built using temporal data in electronic health records ({EHRs}) can potentially play a major role in improving management of chronic diseases. However, these data present a multitude of technical challenges, including irregular sampling of data and varying length of available patient history. In this paper, we describe and evaluate three different approaches that use machine learning to build predictive models using temporal {EHR} data of a patient. The first approach is a commonly used non-temporal approach that aggregates values of the predictors in the patient's medical history. The other two approaches exploit the temporal dynamics of the data. The two temporal approaches vary in how they model temporal information and handle missing data. Using data from the {EHR} of Mount Sinai Medical Center, we learned and evaluated the models in the context of predicting loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate ({eGFR}), the most common assessment of kidney function. Our results show that incorporating temporal information in patient's medical history can lead to better prediction of loss of kidney function. They also demonstrate that exactly how this information is incorporated is important. In particular, our results demonstrate that the relative importance of different predictors varies over time, and that using multi-task learning to account for this is an appropriate way to robustly capture the temporal dynamics in {EHR} data. Using a case study, we also demonstrate how the multi-task learning based model can yield predictive models with better performance for identifying patients at high risk of short-term loss of kidney function.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A 1.5-day interactive forum was convened to discuss critical issues in the acquisition, analysis, and sharing of data in the field of cardiovascular and stroke science. The discussion will serve as the foundation for the American Heart Association's ({AHA}'s) near-term and future strategies in the Big Data area. The concepts evolving from this forum may also inform other fields of medicine and science. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: A total of 47 participants representing stakeholders from 7 domains (patients, basic scientists, clinical investigators, population researchers, clinicians and healthcare system administrators, industry, and regulatory authorities) participated in the conference. Presentation topics included updates on data as viewed from conventional medical and nonmedical sources, building and using Big Data repositories, articulation of the goals of data sharing, and principles of responsible data sharing. Facilitated breakout sessions were conducted to examine what each of the 7 stakeholder domains wants from Big Data under ideal circumstances and the possible roles that the {AHA} might play in meeting their needs. Important areas that are high priorities for further study regarding Big Data include a description of the methodology of how to acquire and analyze findings, validation of the veracity of discoveries from such research, and integration into investigative and clinical care aspects of future cardiovascular and stroke medicine. Potential roles that the {AHA} might consider include facilitating a standards discussion (eg, tools, methodology, and appropriate data use), providing education (eg, healthcare providers, patients, investigators), and helping build an interoperable digital ecosystem in cardiovascular and stroke science. {CONCLUSION}: There was a consensus across stakeholder domains that Big Data holds great promise for revolutionizing the way cardiovascular and stroke research is conducted and clinical care is delivered; however, there is a clear need for the creation of a vision of how to use it to achieve the desired goals. Potential roles for the {AHA} center around facilitating a discussion of standards, providing education, and helping establish a cardiovascular digital ecosystem. This ecosystem should be interoperable and needs to interface with the rapidly growing digital object environment of the modern-day healthcare system.},

We developed risk models for death, death or myocardial infarction ({MI}), and death, {MI}, or severe recurrent ischaemia ({SRI}) using Cox proportional-hazards techniques. Demographic, history, and pre-randomization clinical and medication variables were tested. Validation techniques included development of individual trial models, backward elimination and bootstrapping. Of 118 variables, 17 independently predicted mortality. The strongest associations included greater age (chi(2)=31.1), higher randomization heart rate (chi(2)=27.4), and heart failure ({HF}) variables ({HF} between qualifying event and randomization, chi(2)=21.8; history of {HF}, chi(2)=12.2). Higher creatinine clearance (chi(2)=17.7) and percutaneous coronary intervention between qualifying event and randomization (chi(2)=11.1) most strongly predicted lower risk. Similar characteristics entered the double and triple composite models, but {HF} variables and age less strongly predicted these end-points. {CONCLUSIONS}: In patients stabilized after {ACS}, those at highest risk over the next 90 days can be identified. Typical clinical markers are better at identifying risk of death than non-fatal {MI} or {SRI}. Novel risk markers are needed for these outcomes.},

The trial was conducted at 6 {EMC} Corporation worksites in Massachusetts, each of which had at least 600 employees; 404 {EMC} employees with pre-hypertension or hypertension participated. Participants at 3 worksites received a home blood pressure cuff that uploaded readings to a Web site where they could view trends and read automated rules-based messages. Participants at 3 worksites received access to an onsite blood pressure cuff. Primary outcome measure was change in systolic blood pressure. Secondary outcome measures were change in diastolic blood pressure, proportion of participants achieving significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and subject satisfaction. {RESULTS}: Although the mean change in systolic blood pressure was not significantly different between intervention and control groups (-1.69 vs. -0.86 mm {HG}, respectively, P = .49) the change in diastolic blood pressure between groups was significant.

	abstract = {Sympathetic nervous system responses typically are regionally differentiated, with activation in one outflow sometimes accompanying no change or sympathetic inhibition in another. Regional sympathetic activity is best studied in humans by recording from postganglionic sympathetic efferents (multiunit or single fiber recording) and by isotope dilution-derived measurement of organ-specific norepinephrine release to plasma (regional "norepinephrine spillover"). Evidence assembled in this review indicates that sympathetic nervous system abnormalities are crucial in the development of cardiovascular disorders, notably heart failure, essential hypertension, disorders of postural circulatory control causing syncope, and "psychogenic heart disease," heart disease attributable to mental stress and psychiatric illness. These abnormalities involve persistent, adverse activation of sympathetic outflows to the heart and kidneys in heart failure and hypertension, episodic or ongoing cardiac sympathetic activation in psychogenic heart disease, and defective sympathetic circulatory reflexes in disorders of postural circulatory control. An important goal for clinical scientists is translation of knowledge of pathophysiology, such as this, into better treatment for patients. The achievement of this "mechanisms-to-management" transition is at differing stages of development with the different conditions. Clinical translation is mature in cardiac failure, knowledge of cardiac neural pathophysiology having led to introduction of beta-adrenergic blockers, an effective therapy. With essential hypertension, perhaps we are on the cusp of effective translation, with recent successful testing of selective catheter-based renal sympathetic nerve ablation in patients with resistant hypertension, an intervention firmly based on demonstration of activation of the renal sympathetic outflow. With psychogenic heart disease and postural syncope syndromes, knowledge of the neural pathophysiology is emerging, but clinical translation remains for the future.},

There was no gender difference in body mass index or age. Women with {OSA} were significantly older and had a higher systolic blood pressure, lower diastolic blood pressure, wider pulse pressure and slower heart rate than women without {OSA}.{\textbar}The extraordinarily high prevalence of {OSA} in these patients supports its potential role in the pathogenesis of drug-resistant hypertension, and justifies the undertaking of a randomized controlled trial to corroborate this hypothesis.},

Solution studies, however, indicate that there is complexity in the binding of minor groove agents to a single site. Netropsin, for example, has two {DNA} binding enthalpies in isothermal titration calorimetry ({ITC}) experiments that indicate the compound simultaneously forms two thermodynamically different complexes at a single {AATT} site. Two proposals for the origin of this unusual observation have been developed: (i) two different bound species of netropsin at single binding sites and (ii) a netropsin induced {DNA} hairpin to duplex transition. To develop a better understanding of {DNA} recognition complexity, the two proposals have been tested with several {DNAs} and the methods of mass spectrometry ({MS}), polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ({PAGE}) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in addition to {ITC}. All of the methods with all of the {DNAs} investigated clearly shows that netropsin forms two different complexes at {AATT} sites, and that the proposal for an induced hairpin to duplex transition in this system is incorrect.},

	abstract = {Arterial stiffness is an age-related process that is a shared consequence of numerous diseases including diabetes mellitus ({DM}), and is an independent predictor of mortality both in this population and in the general population. While much has been published about arterial stiffness in patients with {DM}, a thorough review of the current literature is lacking. Using a systematic literature search strategy, we aimed to summarize our current understanding related to arterial stiffness in {DM}. We review key studies demonstrating that, among patients with established {DM}, arterial stiffness is closely related to the progression of complications of {DM}, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. It is also becoming clear that arterial stiffness can be increased even in pre-diabetic populations with impaired glucose tolerance, and in those with the metabolic syndrome ({METS}), well before the onset of overt {DM}. Some data suggests that arterial stiffness can predict the onset of {DM}. However, future work is needed to further clarify whether large artery stiffness and the pulsatile hemodynamic changes that accompany it are involved in the pathogenesis of {DM}, and whether interventions targeting arterial stiffness are associated with improved clinical outcomes in {DM}. We also review of the potential mechanisms of arterial stiffness in {DM}, with particular emphasis on the role of advanced glycation endproducts ({AGEs}) and nitric oxide dysregulation, and address potential future directions for research.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Clinical prediction rules have been advocated as a possible mechanism to enhance clinical judgment in diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic assessment. Despite renewed interest in the their use, inconsistent terminology makes them difficult to index and retrieve by computerized search systems. No validated approaches to locating clinical prediction rules appear in the literature. The objective of this study was to derive and validate an optimal search filter for retrieving clinical prediction rules, using the National Library of Medicine's {MEDLINE} database. {DESIGN}: A comparative, retrospective analysis was conducted. The "gold standard" was established by a manual search of all articles from select print journals for the years 1991 through 1998, which identified articles covering various aspects of clinical prediction rules such as derivation, validation, and evaluation. Search filters were derived, from the articles in the July through December issues of the journals (derivation set), by analyzing the textwords (words in the title and abstract) and the medical subject heading (from the {MeSH} Thesaurus) used to index each article. The accuracy of these filters in retrieving clinical prediction rules was then assessed using articles in the January through June issues (validation set). {MEASUREMENTS}: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and positive likelihood ratio of several different search filters were measured. {RESULTS}: The filter "predict\$ {OR} clinical\$ {OR} outcome\$ {OR} risk\$" retrieved 98 percent of clinical prediction rules. Four filters, such as "predict\$ {OR} validat\$ {OR} rule\$ {OR} predictive value of tests," had both sensitivity and specificity above 90 percent. The top-performing filter for positive predictive value and positive likelihood ratio in the validation set was "predict\$.ti. {AND} rule\$." {CONCLUSIONS}: Several filters with high retrieval value were found. Depending on the goals and time constraints of the searcher, one of these filters could be used.},

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. {METHODS}: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3319 patients) or placebo (3313 patients) [correction] in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1012 deaths occurred. The primary end points were death from any cause and death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia. {RESULTS}: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; P=0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; P=0.005). The rate of the other primary end point, death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular events, was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; P=0.002), as was the secondary end point of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; P=0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; P=0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (P=0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (P{\textless}0.001). {CONCLUSIONS}: The addition of eplerenone to optimal medical therapy reduces morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.},

	abstract = {We performed a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the effect of diltiazem on reinfarction after a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. Nine centers enrolled 576 patients: 287 received diltiazem (90 mg every six hours) and 289 received placebo. Treatment was initiated 24 to 72 hours after the onset of infarction and continued for up to 14 days. The primary end point, reinfarction, was defined as an abnormal reelevation of {MB} creatine kinase in plasma within 14 days. Reinfarction occurred in 27 patients in the placebo group (9.3 percent) and in 15 in the diltiazem group (5.2 percent)--a 51.2 percent reduction in cumulative life-table incidence (P = 0.0297; 90 percent confidence interval, 7 to 67 percent). Diltiazem reduced the frequency of refractory postinfarction angina (a secondary end point) by 49.7 percent (P = 0.0345; 90 percent confidence interval, 6 to 73 percent). Mortality was similar in the two groups (3.1 and 3.8 percent, respectively, in the placebo and diltiazem groups), but adverse drug reactions (most of which were mild) were more common in the diltiazem group. Nevertheless, the drug was well tolerated, despite concurrent treatment with beta-blockers in 61 percent of the patients. We conclude that diltiazem was effective in preventing early reinfarction and severe angina after non-Q-wave infarction and that it was also safe and generally well tolerated.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Patients in general medical-surgical wards who experience unplanned transfer to the intensive care unit ({ICU}) show evidence of physiologic derangement 6-24h prior to their deterioration. With increasing availability of electronic medical records ({EMRs}), automated early warning scores ({EWSs}) are becoming feasible. {OBJECTIVE}: To describe the development and performance of an automated {EWS} based on {EMR} data. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We used a discrete-time logistic regression model to obtain an hourly risk score to predict unplanned transfer to the {ICU} within the next 12h. The model was based on hospitalization episodes from all adult patients (18years) admitted to 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California ({KPNC}) hospitals from 1/1/2010 to 12/31/2013. Eligible patients met these entry criteria: initial hospitalization occurred at a {KPNC} hospital; the hospitalization was not for childbirth; and the {EMR} had been operational at the hospital for at least 3months. We evaluated the performance of this risk score, called Advanced Alert Monitor ({AAM}) and compared it against two other {EWSs} ({eCART} and {NEWS}) in terms of their sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (c statistic). {RESULTS}: A total of 649,418 hospitalization episodes involving 374,838 patients met inclusion criteria, with 19,153 of the episodes experiencing at least one outcome. The analysis data set had 48,723,248 hourly observations. Predictors included physiologic data (laboratory tests and vital signs); neurological status; severity of illness and longitudinal comorbidity indices; care directives; and health services indicators (e.g. elapsed length of stay). {AAM} showed better performance compared to {NEWS} and {eCART} in all the metrics and prediction intervals. The {AAM} {AUC} was 0.82 compared to 0.79 and 0.76 for {eCART} and {NEWS}, respectively. Using a threshold that generated 1 alert per day in a unit with a patient census of 35, the sensitivity of {AAM} was 49\% (95\% {CI}: 47.6-50.3\%) compared to the sensitivities of {eCART} and {NEWS} scores of 44\% (42.3-45.1) and 40\% (38.2-40.9), respectively. For all three scores, about half of alerts occurred within 12h of the event, and almost two thirds within 24h of the event. {CONCLUSION}: The {AAM} score is an example of a score that takes advantage of multiple data streams now available in modern {EMRs}. It highlights the ability to harness complex algorithms to maximize signal extraction. The main challenge in the future is to develop detection approaches for patients in whom data are sparser because their baseline risk is lower.},

In the present post hoc analysis, we evaluated whether B+A is more effective than B+H for reducing {CV} events in patients with known coronary artery disease ({CAD}) at baseline in a subgroup analysis of the Avoiding Cardiovascular events through {COMbination} therapy in Patients {LIving} with Systolic Hypertension ({ACCOMPLISH}) study. The main trial randomized 11,506 patients. Of those, 5,744 received B+A and 5,762 received B+H. Of the 11,506 patients, 5,314 (46\%) were classified as having {CAD} at baseline. The mean patient follow-up period was 35.7 months for the B+A group and 35.6 months for the B+H group. The primary end point was the interval to the first event of composite {CV} morbidity and mortality. At baseline, significant differences were present between the 5,314 with {CAD} and the 6,192 without {CAD}. The patients with {CAD} had a lower systolic blood pressure and heart rate, a lower incidence of diabetes, and greater incidence of dyslipidemia. However, no baseline differences were found between the randomized B+A and B+H groups. In the patients with {CAD}, an 18\% reduction occurred in the hazard ratio for {CV} events (primary end point) with B+A versus B+H (p = 0.0016). In a prespecified secondary analysis of the composite end point, including only {CV} death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, the hazard ratio in the patients with {CAD} was reduced by 25\% (p = 0.0033) in the B+A group compared with the B+H group. B+A was more effective than B+H at comparable blood pressure reductions for reducing {CV} events in patients, regardless of the presence of {CAD}. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the combination of B+A should be preferentially used for older patients with high-risk, stage 2 hypertension.},

The auscultatory technique with a trained observer and mercury sphygmomanometer continues to be the method of choice for measurement in the office, using the first and fifth phases of the Korotkoff sounds, including in pregnant women. The use of mercury is declining, and alternatives are needed. Aneroid devices are suitable, but they require frequent calibration. Hybrid devices that use electronic transducers instead of mercury have promise. The oscillometric method can be used for office measurement, but only devices independently validated according to standard protocols should be used, and individual calibration is recommended. They have the advantage of being able to take multiple measurements. Proper training of observers, positioning of the patient, and selection of cuff size are all essential. It is increasingly recognized that office measurements correlate poorly with blood pressure measured in other settings, and that they can be supplemented by self-measured readings taken with validated devices at home. There is increasing evidence that home readings predict cardiovascular events and are particularly useful for monitoring the effects of treatment. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory monitoring gives a better prediction of risk than office measurements and is useful for diagnosing white-coat hypertension. There is increasing evidence that a failure of blood pressure to fall during the night may be associated with increased risk. In obese patients and children, the use of an appropriate cuff size is of paramount importance.},

We conducted a literature search from 1960 to 2003 to identify studies that evaluated the pharmacokinetic and blood pressure-lowering effects of these 2 agents. There are significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between these diuretics. Chlorthalidone is approximately 1.5 to 2.0 times as potent as hydrochlorothiazide, and the former has a much longer duration of action. Whether these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features cause differences in outcomes is not known.},

Compared with placebo, only {ACE} inhibitors significantly reduced the doubling of serum creatinine levels (odds ratio 0.58, 95\% credible interval 0.32 to 0.90), and only beta blockers showed a significant difference in mortality (odds ratio 7.13, 95\% credible interval 1.37 to 41.39). Comparisons among all treatments showed no statistical significance in the outcome of dialysis. Although the beneficial effects of {ACE} inhibitors compared with {ARBs} did not reach statistical significance, {ACE} inhibitors consistently showed higher probabilities of being in the superior ranking positions among all three outcomes. Although the protective effect of an {ACE} inhibitor plus calcium channel blocker compared with placebo was not statistically significant, the treatment ranking identified this combination therapy to have the greatest probability (73.9\%) for being the best treatment on reducing mortality, followed by {ACE} inhibitor plus diuretic (12.5\%), {ACE} inhibitors (2.0\%), calcium channel blockers (1.2\%), and {ARBs} (0.4\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: Our analyses show the renoprotective effects and superiority of using {ACE} inhibitors in patients with diabetes, and available evidence is not able to show a better effect for {ARBs} compared with {ACE} inhibitors. Considering the cost of drugs, our findings support the use of {ACE} inhibitors as the first line antihypertensive agent in patients with diabetes. Calcium channel blockers might be the preferred treatment in combination with {ACE} inhibitors if adequate blood pressure control cannot be achieved by {ACE} inhibitors alone.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) is the leading killer of women in the United States, yet medical care is often based on evidence from clinical trials performed predominantly with men. Numerous studies show that {CVD} risk factors, clinical presentation, treatment, and treatment outcomes can vary between men and women. {METHODS}: The Cochrane Library maintains a large database of critically appraised evidence including meta-analyses of clinical trials, called Systematic Reviews. There were 30 Systematic Reviews pertaining to the treatment of {CVD} published collectively by the Cochrane Heart Group, Hypertension Group, and Peripheral Vascular Diseases Groups at the time of our study. We examined these 30 Systematic Reviews and the great majority of the clinical trials used for their meta-analyses for inclusion of women and gender-based data analyses. Women comprised only 27\% of the pooled population of 258 clinical trials. {RESULTS}: Of those trials that included both men and women (n = 196), only 33\% examined outcomes by gender. In trials that performed a gender-based analysis, 20\% reported significant (p {\textless} 0.05) differences in cardiovascular-related outcomes by gender. {CONCLUSIONS}: We conclude that (1) there are not enough large-scale clinical trials or meta-analyses concerning {CVD} in women to determine if their medical treatment should differ from that of men, (2) all clinical trials relating to {CVD} treatment should have significantly more female participants, and gender-based analyses should be performed, as currently recommended for National Institutes of Health ({NIH})-sponsored research by the {NIH} Revitalization Act of 1993, and (3) the Cochrane Library would be a more useful tool for the evidence-based healthcare of women if the Systematic Reviews used all available gender-specific information in their analyses.},

	abstract = {Importance: County-level patterns in mortality rates by cause have not been systematically described but are potentially useful for public health officials, clinicians, and researchers seeking to improve health and reduce geographic disparities. Objectives: To demonstrate the use of a novel method for county-level estimation and to estimate annual mortality rates by {US} county for 21 mutually exclusive causes of death from 1980 through 2014. Design, Setting, and Participants: Redistribution methods for garbage codes (implausible or insufficiently specific cause of death codes) and small area estimation methods (statistical methods for estimating rates in small subpopulations) were applied to death registration data from the National Vital Statistics System to estimate annual county-level mortality rates for 21 causes of death. These estimates were raked (scaled along multiple dimensions) to ensure consistency between causes and with existing national-level estimates. Geographic patterns in the age-standardized mortality rates in 2014 and in the change in the age-standardized mortality rates between 1980 and 2014 for the 10 highest-burden causes were determined. Exposure: County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cause-specific age-standardized mortality rates. Results: A total of 80412524 deaths were recorded from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2014, in the United States. Of these, 19.4 million deaths were assigned garbage codes. Mortality rates were analyzed for 3110 counties or groups of counties. Large between-county disparities were evident for every cause, with the gap in age-standardized mortality rates between counties in the 90th and 10th percentiles varying from 14.0 deaths per 100000 population (cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases) to 147.0 deaths per 100000 population (cardiovascular diseases). Geographic regions with elevated mortality rates differed among causes: for example, cardiovascular disease mortality tended to be highest along the southern half of the Mississippi River, while mortality rates from self-harm and interpersonal violence were elevated in southwestern counties, and mortality rates from chronic respiratory disease were highest in counties in eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia. Counties also varied widely in terms of the change in cause-specific mortality rates between 1980 and 2014. For most causes (eg, neoplasms, neurological disorders, and self-harm and interpersonal violence), both increases and decreases in county-level mortality rates were observed. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis of {US} cause-specific county-level mortality rates from 1980 through 2014, there were large between-county differences for every cause of death, although geographic patterns varied substantially by cause of death. The approach to county-level analyses with small area models used in this study has the potential to provide novel insights into {US} disease-specific mortality time trends and their differences across geographic regions.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Lifesaving early distinction of infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome, known as "sepsis," from noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome is challenging in the {ICU} because of high systemic inflammatory response syndrome prevalence and lack of specific biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to use an automatic algorithm to detect systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria (tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, and fever) in surgical {ICU} patients for {ICU}-wide systemic inflammatory response syndrome prevalence determination and evaluation of algorithm-derived systemic inflammatory response syndrome descriptors for sepsis prediction and diagnosis in a polytrauma cohort. {DESIGN}: Cross-sectional descriptive study and retrospective cohort study. {SETTING}: Electronic medical records of a tertiary care center's surgical {ICU}, 2006-2011. {PATIENTS}: All {ICU} admissions and consecutive polytrauma admissions. {INTERVENTIONS}: None. {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Average prevalence of conventional systemic inflammatory response syndrome ({\textgreater}/= 2 criteria met concomitantly) from cross-sectional application of the algorithm to all {ICU} patients and each minute of the study period was 43.3\%. Of 256 validated polytrauma patients, 85 developed sepsis (33.2\%). Three systemic inflammatory response syndrome descriptors summarized the 24 hours after admission and before therapy initiation: 1) systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria average for systemic inflammatory response syndrome quantification over time, 2) first-to-last minute difference for trend detection, and 3) change count reflecting systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria fluctuation. Conventional systemic inflammatory response syndrome for greater than or equal to 1 minute had 91\% sensitivity and 19\% specificity, whereas a systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria average cutoff value of 1.72 had 51\% sensitivity and 77\% specificity for sepsis prediction. For sepsis diagnosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria average and first-to-last minute difference combined yielded 82\% sensitivity and 71\% specificity compared with 99\% sensitivity and only 31\% specificity of conventional systemic inflammatory response syndrome from a nested case-control analysis. {CONCLUSIONS}: Dynamic systemic inflammatory response syndrome descriptors improved specificity of sepsis prediction and particularly diagnosis, rivaling established biomarkers, in a polytrauma cohort. They may enhance electronic sepsis surveillance once evaluated in other patient populations.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Treatment regimens that require fewer dosage units and less frequent dosing to decrease the complexity and cost of care are among the strategies recommended to improve compliance with antihypertensive therapy. Simplifying therapy may be particularly important for elderly patients, who are more likely to have co-morbid conditions and to be taking multiple medications. {OBJECTIVE}: To determine rates of compliance with antihypertensive therapy and total costs of care among elderly Medicaid recipients treated with fixed-dose combination amlodipine besylate/benazepril versus a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist and {ACE} inhibitor prescribed as separate agents (free combination). {STUDY} {DESIGN}: A longitudinal, retrospective, cohort analysis of South Carolina Medicaid claims for ambulatory services, hospital services, Medicare crossover, and prescription drug for the years 1997-2002. Follow-up was 12 months from the index date, defined as the first prescription dispensing date for a study drug. {PATIENTS}: South Carolina Medicaid beneficiaries aged {\textgreater}or=65 years. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURE}: Outcomes variables included compliance defined as the medication possession ratio ({MPR}), which was the total days' supply of drug (excluding last prescription fill) divided by the length of follow-up (with number of hospital days subtracted from the numerator and denominator). We hypothesized that elderly individuals receiving fixed-dose combination amlodipine besylate/benazepril {HCl} would be more compliant with therapy than those receiving a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist and {ACE} inhibitor as free combination. {RESULTS}: There were 2336 individuals in the fixed-combination group and 3368 in the free-combination group. The mean age was 76.0 +/- 7.2 years, and 82.6\% were female. Compliance rates were significantly higher with fixed-dose versus free-combination therapy (63.4\% vs 49.0\%; p {\textless} 0.0001). The average total cost of care for patients receiving the fixed-dose combination was \${US}3179 compared with \${US}5236 (2002 values) for the free-combination regimen. In multivariate regression analyses on the log of total cost of care, average total costs increased by 0.5\% for each 1-unit increase in {MPR}, and for each additional co-morbidity (measured by the chronic disease score) there was an increase of 10.4\%. However, average total costs were reduced by 12.5\% for patients using fixed-dose versus free-combination therapy (p {\textless} 0.003). {CONCLUSION}: Use of fixed-dose amlodipine besylate/benazepril {HCl} by elderly Medicaid recipients was associated with improved compliance and lower healthcare costs compared with a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist and {ACE} inhibitor prescribed as separate agents.},

This classically defined resistant group consists of patients with true resistant hypertension, controlled resistant hypertension and pseudo-resistant hypertension. In studies where pseudo-resistant hypertension cannot be excluded (for example, 24-h ambulatory {BP} not obtained), the term apparent resistant hypertension has been used to identify 'apparent' lack of control on {\textgreater} or =3 medications. Large, well-designed studies have recently reported the prevalence of resistant hypertension. Pooling prevalence data from these studies and others within North America and Europe with a combined sample size of {\textgreater}600,000 hypertensive participants, the prevalence of resistant hypertension is 14.8\% of treated hypertensive patients and 12.5\% of all hypertensives. However, the prevalence of true resistant hypertension, defined as uncontrolled both by office and 24-h ambulatory {BP} monitoring with confirmed medication adherence, may be more meaningful in terms of identifying risk and estimating benefit from newer therapies like renal denervation. Rates of cardiovascular events and mortality follow mean 24-h ambulatory {BPs} in patients with resistant hypertension, and true resistant hypertension represents the highest risk. The prevalence of true resistant hypertension has not been directly measured in large trials; however, combined data from smaller studies suggest that true resistant hypertension is present in half of the patients with resistant hypertension who are uncontrolled in the office. Our pooled analysis shows prevalence rates of 10.1\% and 7.9\% for uncontrolled resistant hypertension among individuals treated for hypertension and all hypertensive individuals, respectively.},

Subsidiary aims were: to compare the course of blood pressure in two groups, one taking bendrofluazide and one taking propranolol, and to compare the incidence of suspected adverse reactions to these two drugs. The study was single blind and based almost entirely in general practices; 17 354 patients were recruited, and 85 572 patient years of observation have accrued. Patients were randomly allocated at entry to take bendrofluazide or propranolol or placebo tablets. The primary results were as follows. The stroke rate was reduced on active treatment: 60 strokes occurred in the treated group and 109 in the placebo group, giving rates of 1.4 and 2.6 per 1000 patient years of observation respectively (p less than 0.01 on sequential analysis). Treatment made no difference, however, to the overall rates of coronary events: 222 events occurred on active treatment and 234 in the placebo group (5.2 and 5.5 per 1000 patient years respectively). The incidence of all cardiovascular events was reduced on active treatment: 286 events occurred in the treated group and 352 in the placebo group, giving rates of 6.7 and 8.2 per 1000 patient years respectively (p less than 0.05 on sequential analysis). For mortality from all causes treatment made no difference to the rates. There were 248 deaths in the treated group and 253 in the placebo group (rates 5.8 and 5.9 per 1000 patient years respectively). Several post hoc analyses of subgroup results were also performed but they require very cautious interpretation. The all cause mortality was reduced in men on active treatment (157 deaths versus 181 in the placebo group; 7.1 and 8.2 per 1000 patient years respectively) but increased in women on active treatment (91 deaths versus 72; 4.4 and 3.5 per 1000 patient years respectively). The difference between the sexes in their response to treatment was significant (p = 0.05). Comparison of the two active drugs showed that the reduction in stroke rate on bendrofluazide was greater than that on propranolol (p = 0.002). The stroke rate was reduced in both smokers and non-smokers taking bendrofluazide but only in non-smokers taking propranolol. This difference between the responses to the two drugs was significant (p = 0.03).({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

We assessed perinatal care expenditures from Medicaid claims and encounter data among non-{MCO} enrollees with increased risk pregnancies who gave birth in Florida during 1998-2006. We used a pre-post design to compare adjusted perinatal medical expenditures among women who received Healthy Start care coordination (n = 41,067) to women who were not contacted by the Healthy Start program after screening (n = 24,282). We calculated adjusted average costs and difference-in-differences using marginal estimates from multivariable linear mixed regression models. From the pre-waiver (January 1998-July 2001) to the late-post waiver (July 2004-December 2006), all prenatal medical costs increased \$274 among care coordination participants and decreased \$601 among women not contacted by the Healthy Start program, equaling a \$875 increased cost difference between care coordination and no contact groups. During this same time period, delivery related expenditures increased \$395 less among care coordination participants compared to women not contacted by Healthy Start. Additionally, infant medical care costs during days 29-365 decreased by an average of \$240 less among the care coordination compared to the no contact group. The Medicaid waiver may have decreased delivery costs, but medical costs were increased following the waiver when considering all perinatal care. Further exploration of factors associated with the decreased delivery costs may help develop more efficient prenatal support programs.},

Some have recently expressed a preference for {CTDN}. However, head-to-head trials testing the effect of the 2 drugs on cardiovascular events ({CVEs}) are lacking. We conducted a systematic review of randomized trials in which 1 arm was based on either {HCTZ} or {CTDN} followed by 2 types of network meta-analyses, a drug-adjusted analysis and an office systolic blood pressure-adjusted analysis. Nine trials were identified: 3 based on {HCTZ} and 6 based on {CTDN}. In the drug-adjusted analysis (n = 50946), the percentage of risk reduction in congestive heart failure for {CTDN} versus {HCTZ} was 23 (95\% {CI}, 2-39; P = 0.032); and in all {CVEs} was 21 (95\% {CI}, 12-28; P{\textless}0.0001). In the office systolic blood pressure-adjusted analysis (n = 78350), the percentage of risk reduction in {CVEs} for {CTDN} versus {HCTZ} was 18 (95\% {CI}, 3-30; P = 0.024). When the reduction in office systolic blood pressure was identical in the 2 arms, the risk for {CVEs} in {HCTZ} arms was 19\% higher than in its nondiuretic comparator arms (P = 0.021). Relative to {HCTZ}, the number needed to treat with {CTDN} to prevent 1 {CVE} over 5 years was 27. In conclusion, {CTDN} is superior to {HCTZ} in preventing cardiovascular events. This cannot be attributed entirely to the lesser effect of {HCTZ} on office systolic blood pressure but may be attributed to the pleomorphic effects of alternative medications or to the short duration of action of {HCTZ}.},

	abstract = {This study examined the simple behavior on the part of hypertensive patients of having their blood pressure checked at a retail store. We found that hypertensive patients checked their blood pressure frequently using these automated machines, believe them to be accurate, and frequently make health care decisions based on the reading they obtain. The inaccuracy of these machines is apparently not widely known. It is therefore incumbent on physicians to be aware of technologies that are in use by their patients. Patients need to be educated about the appropriate use and potential or harm that results from misuse of these technologies. Physicians might encourage their patients to invest in a home blood pressure monitor that they can bring with them to their visit to calibrate against the physician's own machine.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Melatonin plays a role in the biologic regulation of circadian rhythms, including sleep. Melatonin has also been shown to modulate vascular smooth muscle tone and to induce hemodynamic effects in humans. {OBJECTIVE}: To evaluate whether melatonin plays a role in the circadian rhythm of blood pressure in hypertensive patients. {METHODS}: Sixteen elderly patients with essential hypertension were evaluated. Patients were defined as either dippers ({DIP}, n = 8) or non-dippers ({NDIP}, n = 8) according to the nocturnal change in the mean arterial pressure ({MAP}). 6-Sulfatoxymelatonin (6-{SMT}), the main melatonin metabolite, was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ({ELISA}) in two separate urine collections, one in the daytime and one during the night. {RESULTS}: Both groups of {DIP} and {NDIP} hypertensives were comparable in regard to age and sex. During the night, the mean arterial pressure decreased by 10.3 +/- 2.2\% in the {DIP} and increased by 7.5 +/- 1.7\% in the {NDIP} group (p {\textless} 0.01). Daily 6-{SMT} was comparable in {DIP} (3.28 +/- 0.87 microg/12 h) and {NDIP} (2.31 +/- 0.68 microg/12 h) (p = 0.39). However, while the {DIP} presented the physiological nocturnal increase in urinary 6-{SMT} (mean 8.19 +/- 1.68 microg/ 12 h), this surge of melatonin production was missing in {NDIP} in whom nocturnal urinary 6-{SMT} concentrations were not significantly different from daily levels (mean 2.56 +/- 0.79 microg/12 h). The nocturnal change in urinary 6-{SMT} excretion was positively correlated to the nocturnal change in {MAP} (R = 0.54; p = 0.031). {CONCLUSIONS}: {NDIP} hypertensive patients differ from {DIP} hypertensives by having an impaired nocturnal melatonin secretion. Thus, melatonin may play a role in the circadian rhythm of blood pressure in hypertensive patients.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Blood pressure is an important determinant of the risks of macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes, and guidelines recommend intensive lowering of blood pressure for diabetic patients with hypertension. We assessed the effects of the routine administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitor-diuretic combination on serious vascular events in patients with diabetes, irrespective of initial blood pressure levels or the use of other blood pressure lowering drugs. {METHODS}: The trial was done by 215 collaborating centres in 20 countries. After a 6-week active run-in period, 11 140 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomised to treatment with a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide or matching placebo, in addition to current therapy. The primary endpoints were composites of major macrovascular and microvascular events, defined as death from cardiovascular disease, non-fatal stroke or non-fatal myocardial infarction, and new or worsening renal or diabetic eye disease, and analysis was by intention-to-treat. The macrovascular and microvascular composites were analysed jointly and separately. This trial is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}00145925. {FINDINGS}: After a mean of 4.3 years of follow-up, 73\% of those assigned active treatment and 74\% of those assigned control remained on randomised treatment. Compared with patients assigned placebo, those assigned active therapy had a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 5.6 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 2.2 mm Hg. The relative risk of a major macrovascular or microvascular event was reduced by 9\% (861 [15.5\%] active vs 938 [16.8\%] placebo; hazard ratio 0.91, 95\% {CI} 0.83-1.00, p=0.04). The separate reductions in macrovascular and microvascular events were similar but were not independently significant (macrovascular 0.92; 0.81-1.04, p=0.16; microvascular 0.91; 0.80-1.04, p=0.16). The relative risk of death from cardiovascular disease was reduced by 18\% (211 [3.8\%] active vs 257 [4.6\%] placebo; 0.82, 0.68-0.98, p=0.03) and death from any cause was reduced by 14\% (408 [7.3\%] active vs 471 [8.5\%] placebo; 0.86, 0.75-0.98, p=0.03). There was no evidence that the effects of the study treatment differed by initial blood pressure level or concomitant use of other treatments at baseline. {INTERPRETATION}: Routine administration of a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide to patients with type 2 diabetes was well tolerated and reduced the risks of major vascular events, including death. Although the confidence limits were wide, the results suggest that over 5 years, one death due to any cause would be averted among every 79 patients assigned active therapy.},

Persons aged {\textgreater} or =18 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES}) 1999-2004 were classified as hypertensive based on a {BP} {\textgreater} or =140/90 mm Hg, currently taking antihypertensive medication, or having been diagnosed by a physician. {RESULTS}: Among hypertensives, the prevalence of antihypertensive medication use was significantly higher among women than men (61.4\% vs. 56.8\%), especially among middle-aged persons (40-49 years, 53.1\% vs. 42.7\%) and among non-Hispanic blacks (65.5\% vs. 54.6\%). Also, treated women were more likely than men to use diuretics (31.6\% vs. 22.3\%) and angiotensin receptor blockers (11.3\% vs. 8.7\%). Among treated hypertensives, the proportion taking three or more antihypertensive drugs was lower among women than men, especially among older persons (60-69 years: 12.3\% vs. 19.8\%, 70-79 years: 18.6\% vs. 21.2\%, and {\textgreater} or =80 years: 18.8\% vs. 22.8\%).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Coronary artery ectasia ({CAE}) is a clinical entity characterized by localized or diffuse dilatation of more than or equal to 1.5 times that of the normal adjacent segments of vessels. Although the etiopathogenesis is not clearly understood, some studies have shown that {CAE} may be a form of atherosclerosis and has more potent inflammatory properties. Leukocytes have a crucial role in the development of inflammatory processes. We aimed to investigate a possible relationship between leukocytes and the coronary ectatic process without coronary artery disease ({CAD}) and to compare it with the inflammatory atherosclerotic process related to leukocytes. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: The study population consisted of 371 patients. We divided the patients into three groups: 42 patients with isolated {CAE} as group I, 279 patients with {CAD} as group {II}, and 50 control participants with normal coronary arteries ({NCA}) as group {III}. The counts of total leukocytes (7348+/-1898, 7569+/-1619, and 6770+/-1748 cells/mm, P=0.002), neutrophils (4260+/-2169, 4529+/-1380, and 4040+/-1649 cells/mm, P=0.037) and monocytes (630+/-216, 583+/-198, and 480+/-140 cells/mm, P{\textless}0.001) were significantly different among the {CAE}, {CAD}, and {NCA} groups, respectively. The {CAE} group also had significantly higher leukocyte and subtype counts than the nonobstructive {CAD} subgroup and {NCA} group. {CONCLUSION}: This study demonstrates that total and differential leukocyte counts, which play an important role in inflammation, are increased in patients with isolated {CAE}. In conclusion, this study's findings show that leukocytes may play an important role in the development of {CAE} independently of the atherosclerotic process.},

Dry cough is a common side effect of {ACE} inhibitors and has been identified as a possible risk factor for angioedema. {OBJECTIVE}: We compared characteristics between patients with {ACE} inhibitor-induced angioedema and cough with the aim of identifying risk factors that differ between these adverse events. {METHODS}: Data on patients with angioedema or cough induced by {ACE} inhibitors were collected from the Swedish database of spontaneously reported {ADRs} or from collaborating clinicians. Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fisher's exact test, and odds ratios ({ORs}) with 95\% {CIs} were used to test for between-group differences. The significance threshold was set to P {\textless}0.00128 to correct for multiple comparisons. {RESULTS}: Clinical characteristics were compared between 168 patients with angioedema and 121 with cough only. Smoking and concomitant selective calcium channel blocker treatment were more frequent among patients with angioedema than cough: {OR} = 4.3, 95\% {CI} = 2.1-8.9, P = 2.2 x 10-5, and {OR} = 3.7, 95\% {CI} = 2.0-7.0, P = 1.7 x 10-5. Angioedema cases were seen more often in male patients ({OR} = 2.2, 95\% {CI} = 1.4-3.6, P = 1.3 x 10-4) and had longer time to onset and higher doses than those with cough ( P = 3.2 x 10-10 and P = 2.6 x 10-4). A multiple model containing the variables smoking, concurrent calcium channel blocker treatment, male sex, and time to onset accounted for 26\% of the variance between the groups. {CONCLUSION}: Smoking, comedication with selective calcium channel blockers, male sex, and longer treatment time were associated with {ACE} inhibitor-induced angioedema rather than cough.},

	abstract = {Resistant hypertension is defined as uncontrolled hypertension despite intensive treatment with at least three antihypertensive agents, one of which ideally should be a diuretic. To determine the efficacy and safety of the selective aldosterone antagonist eplerenone in this population, we studied patients with resistant hypertension (clinic blood pressure [{BP}] {\textgreater}140 mm Hg systolic or {\textgreater}90 mm Hg diastolic on maximal doses of more than three antihypertensive agents, including a loop or thiazide diuretic). At baseline and after 12 weeks of eplerenone therapy (50 to 100 mg daily titrated to effect), patients underwent clinic and 24-hour {BP} measurements, serum potassium, plasma renin activity, and serum aldosterone measurements. Patients (n = 52) completing the trial averaged 62 +/- 10 years of age, were overweight (mean body mass index, 32.1 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2)), and had variable renal function (glomerular filtration rate, 106 +/- 38 {mL}/minute); 70\% were men and 74\% were non-Black. The mean number of antihypertensive agents at baseline was 3.7 +/- 0.8 (range, three to seven drugs) to achieve a clinic {BP} of 150.5/84.1 mm Hg. The mean serum aldosterone was 12.9 +/- 7.6 ng/{mL} and plasma renin activity was 2.3 +/- 2.7 ng/{mL}/hour. After eplerenone, the change from baseline in the clinic {BP} was -17.6/-7.9 mm Hg (P {\textless} .0001 for both systolic blood pressure [{SBP}] and diastolic blood pressure [{DBP}]) and in 24-hour {BP} was -12.2/-6.0 mm Hg (P {\textless} .0001 for both). The number of antihypertensive drugs decreased to 3.3 +/- 0.9 (range, one to seven agents). Plasma potassium increased by 0.30 +/- 0.45 {mEq}/L (P {\textless} .001), but there were only three instances in two patients of mild hyperkalemia (potassium {\textgreater}5.5 {mEq}/L, but {\textless}6.0 {mEq}/L), despite all patients being on a background therapy that included an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Reductions in clinic and ambulatory {BP} were related to baseline clinic and ambulatory {BP} values (r(2) {\textgreater} 0.3 for both {SBP} and {DBP}, P {\textless} .0001), weakly related to baseline serum aldosterone (r = -0.30; P = .05), and unrelated to plasma renin activity, age, gender, or race. In conclusion, eplerenone demonstrated substantial efficacy in treatment-resistant hypertension and was well-tolerated with modest changes in plasma potassium. Serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity did not predict {BP} responses to eplerenone in this population.},

Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios ({ORs}), with adjustments for demographic characteristics, clinical variables, and medication use. {RESULTS}: Of 470,386 hypertensive individuals, 60,327 (12.8\%) were identified as having resistant disease, representing 15.3\% of those taking medications. Overall, 37,061 patients (7.9\%) had uncontrolled hypertension while taking 3 or more medicines. The {ORs} (95\% {CIs}) for resistant hypertension were greater for black race (1.68 [1.62-1.75]), older age (1.11 [1.10-1.11] for every 5-year increase), male sex (1.06 [1.03-1.10]), and obesity (1.46 [1.42-1.51]). Medication adherence rates were higher in those with resistant hypertension (93\% vs 89.8\%; P{\textless}.001). Chronic kidney disease ({OR}, 1.84; 95\% {CI}, 1.78-1.90), diabetes mellitus ({OR}, 1.58; 95\% {CI}, 1.53-1.63), and cardiovascular disease ({OR}, 1.34; 95\% {CI}, 1.30-1.39) were also associated with higher risk of resistant hypertension. {CONCLUSION}: In a more standardized hypertension treatment environment, we observed a rate of resistant hypertension comparable with that of previous studies using more fragmented data sources. Past observations have been limited due to nonrepresentative populations, reliability of the data, heterogeneity of the treatment environments, and less than ideal control rates. This cohort, which was established using an electronic medical record-based approach, has the potential to provide a better understanding of resistant hypertension and outcomes.},

None of the 35 patients had worsening of their seizure frequency after the conversion to monotherapy. Fourteen of the 35 patients (40\%) became seizure-free. Nine of 35 patients (26\%) had a 50\% reduction in seizure frequency. Five of 35 patients (14\%) had a 75\% reduction in seizure frequency. Twenty-eight (80\%) of 35 patients participated in a quality-of-life questionnaire. Quality of life was rated as better on monotherapy as compared with polypharmacy in a number of domains: memory loss, concern over medication long-term effects, difficulty in taking the medications, trouble with leisure time activities, and overall state of health. This improvement reached statistical significance. Conversion to monotherapy in patients with {MRE} may be successful in achieving a reduction in seizure frequency and an improvement in quality-of-life parameters. A prospective, randomized trial is necessary to validate these findings.},

The present study sought to describe differences in metabolic control and pump use in young people with type 1 diabetes using data collected in three multicentre registries. {METHODS}: Data for the years 2011 and 2012 from 54,410 children and adolescents were collected from the Prospective Diabetes Follow-up Registry ({DPV}; n = 26,198), T1D Exchange (T1DX; n = 13,755) and the National Paediatric Diabetes Audit ({NPDA}; n = 14,457). The modality of insulin delivery, based on age, sex and ethnic minority status, and the impact of pump use on {HbA}1c levels were compared. {RESULTS}: The overall mean {HbA}1c level was higher in the {NPDA} (8.9 +/- 1.6\% [74 +/- 17.5 mmol/mol]) than in the {DPV} (8.0 +/- 1.6\% [64 +/- 17.0 mmol/mol], p {\textless} 0.001) and T1DX (8.3 +/- 1.4\% [68 +/- 15.4 mmol/mol], p {\textless} 0.001). Conversely, pump use was much lower in the {NPDA} (14\%) than in the {DPV} (41\%, p {\textless} 0.001) and T1DX (47\%, p {\textless} 0.001). In a pooled analysis, pump use was associated with a lower mean {HbA}1c (pump: 8.0 +/- 1.2\% [64 +/- 13.3 mmol/mol] vs injection: 8.5 +/- 1.7\% [69 +/- 18.7 mmol/mol], p {\textless} 0.001). In all three registries, those with an ethnic minority status were less likely to be treated with a pump (p {\textless} 0.001) and boys were treated with a pump less often compared with girls (p {\textless} 0.001). {CONCLUSIONS}/{INTERPRETATION}: Despite similar clinical characteristics and proportion of minority participants, substantial differences in metabolic control exist across the three large transatlantic registries of paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes, which appears to be due in part to the frequency of insulin pump therapy.},

Permanent pacing was performed in 232 patients aged 21-50 years, 135 males and 97 females, from 1965 through 1995. One hundred and twenty-six subjects (54\%) had evidence of structural heart disease, while idiopathic conduction disease accounted for 46\%. About half (54\%) of 106 patients with structural heart disease had surgically induced heart block. Pacing mode at primary implantation was single chamber in 65\% and dual chamber in 35\%. Follow-up ranged from 12-387 months, with a mean of 104-months. At the last follow-up, 133 of 232 patients (57\%) were alive, 40 (17\%) had died, 30 (13\%) were lost to follow-up, 26 (11\%) were transferred elsewhere, and 3 (1\%) explanted. Patients with sick sinus syndrome had similar outcomes to those with {AV} block. There was a sharp decline in survival during the first six months; 7.5\% of the sample died within the first year following their first pacemaker operation. After the first year, the decline in survival slowed and 70\% of the patients could be expected to survive beyond 20 years. The overall survival of young patients without structural heart disease who received a permanent pacemaker was comparable to an age- and sex-matched control population, while patients with structural heart disease performed significantly worse than the control population.},

We quantified the number and diameter of native collaterals and their remodeling in 3-, 16-, 24-, and 31-month-old mice. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Aging caused an "age-dose-dependent" greater drop in perfusion immediately after femoral artery ligation, followed by a diminished recovery of flow and increase in tissue injury. These effects were associated with a decline in collateral number, diameter, and remodeling. Angiogenesis was also impaired. Mechanistically, these changes were not accompanied by reduced recruitment of T cells or macrophages to remodeling collaterals. However, endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling was dysfunctional, as indicated by increased protein nitrosylation and less phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein in collateral wall cells. The cerebral circulation exhibited a similar age-dose-dependent loss of collateral number and diameter and increased tortuosity, resulting in an increase in collateral resistance and infarct volume (eg, 6- and 3-fold, respectively, in 24-month-old mice) after artery occlusion. This was not associated with rarefaction of similarly sized arterioles. Collateral remodeling was also reduced. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings demonstrate that aging causes rarefaction and insufficiency of the collateral circulation in multiple tissues, resulting in more severe ischemic tissue injury.},

The patients were grouped by age in 10-year increments (aged {\textgreater}or=80, n=2180; 70-{\textless}80, n=6126; 60-{\textless}70, n=7602; {\textless}60, n=6668). Patients were randomized to either verapamil {SR}- or atenolol-based treatment strategies, and primary outcome was first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. {RESULTS}: At baseline, increasing age was associated with higher systolic blood pressure, lower diastolic blood pressure, and wider pulse pressure (P {\textless}.001). Treatment decreased systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure for each age group. However, the very old retained the widest pulse pressure and the highest proportion (23.6\%) with primary outcome. The adjusted hazard ratio for primary outcomes showed a J-shaped relationship among each age group with on-treatment systolic and diastolic pressures. The systolic pressure at the hazard ratio nadir increased with increasing age, highest for the very old (140 mm Hg). However, diastolic pressure at the hazard ratio nadir was only somewhat lower for the very old (70 mm Hg). Results were independent of treatment strategy. {CONCLUSION}: Optimal management of hypertension in very old coronary artery disease patients may involve targeting specific systolic and diastolic blood pressures that are higher and somewhat lower, respectively, compared with other age groups.},

This study aimed to determine the frequency and risk factors of hypertension among individuals aged 50 years and over, and to examine its effect on the health related quality of life ({HRQOL}). {METHODS}: This population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in two settlements in a region of western Turkey between March 1 and April 30, 2007. A questionnaire concerning life habits associated with hypertension, medical histories, and demographic characteristics was filled in by a face to face interview. The {SF}-36 scale was used to assess {HRQOL}. Body mass index ({BMI}) was calculated by measuring the weight and length of the body. {RESULTS}: Of 1599 individuals living in the region, 1193 participated in the survey (48.3\% men and 51.7\% women). The overall prevalence rate of hypertension was 59.5\% (n=710), being 58.0\% in men and 60.9\% in women (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The variables that most positively influenced hypertension (P {\textless} 0.05, for each one) were older age (especially the age group of those aged 60 and over), single, no health insurance, consumption of animal fat in meals, and family history of hypertension. The {HRQOL} of the patients with hypertension was lower than that of those without hypertension (P {\textless} or = 0.05). The {HRQOL} was better in hypertensive patients whose blood pressure was under control, whereas it was worse in those with at least one chronic disorder accompanying hypertension (P {\textless} 0.05, for each one). {CONCLUSIONS}: Great emphasis should be placed on the need for a public health program for the detection, prevention, and control of hypertension, including other risk factors, as well as for the modification of foods and life habits, specifically in individuals who are most likely to be at risk of hypertension.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In previous clinical trials in high-risk hypertensive patients, paradoxically higher cardiovascular event rates have been reported in patients of normal weight compared with obese individuals. As a prespecified analysis of the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension ({ACCOMPLISH}) trial, we aimed to investigate whether the type of hypertension treatment affects patients' cardiovascular outcomes according to their body size. {METHODS}: On the basis of body-mass index ({BMI}), we divided the full {ACCOMPLISH} cohort into obese ({BMI} ≥30, n=5709), overweight (≥25 to {\textless}30, n=4157), or normal weight ({\textless}25, n=1616) categories. The {ACCOMPLISH} cohort had already been randomised to treatment with single-pill combinations of either benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide or benazepril and amlodipine. We compared event rates (adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, previous cardiovascular events, stroke, or chronic kidney disease) for the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke. The analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}00170950. {FINDINGS}: In patients allocated benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide, the primary endpoint (per 1000 patient-years) was 30·7 in normal weight, 21·9 in overweight, and 18·2 in obese patients (overall p=0·0034). However, in those allocated benazepril and amlodipine, the primary endpoint did not differ between the three {BMI} groups (18·2, 16·9, and 16·5, respectively; overall p=0·9721). In obese individuals, primary event rates were similar with both benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide and benazepril and amlodipine, but rates were significantly lower with benazepril and amlodipine in overweight patients (hazard ratio 0·76, 95\% {CI} 0·59-0·94; p=0·0369) and those of normal weight (0·57, 0·39-0·84; p=0·0037). {INTERPRETATION}: Hypertension in normal weight and obese patients might be mediated by different mechanisms. Thiazide-based treatment gives less cardiovascular protection in normal weight than obese patients, but amlodipine-based therapy is equally effective across {BMI} subgroups and thus offers superior cardiovascular protection in non-obese hypertension. {FUNDING}: Novartis Pharmaceuticals.},

	abstract = {The 17th century London neuroanatomical school headed by Thomas Willis provided us with the first identifiable images of the sympathetic nervous system. Nineteenth century giants of European physiology (Bernard, Waller and Brown-Sequard) identified these as the 'pressor nerves'. Von Euler's demonstration that the sympathetic transmitter was noradrenaline brought the field into the modern era. The development of ganglion-blocking drugs by Paton, whose name this review commemorates, allowed comprehensive pharmacological antagonism of this system in patients. With the development of contemporary techniques for recording from human sympathetic nerves and quantifying rates of noradrenaline release, the sympathetic nervous system became accessible to clinical scientists investigating possible contributions to cardiovascular and other diseases. Sympathetic nervous system responses typically are regionally differentiated, with activation in one outflow sometimes accompanying no change or sympathetic inhibition in another. Regional sympathetic activity is best studied in humans by recording from postganglionic sympathetic efferents (multi-unit or single-fibre recording) and by isotope dilution-derived measurement of organ-specific noradrenaline release to plasma from sympathetic nerves (regional 'noradrenaline spillover'). With the application of these techniques, evidence has been assembled in the past three decades which indicates that sympathetic nervous system activation is crucial in the development of cardiovascular disorders, most notably heart failure and essential hypertension. An important goal for clinical scientists is translation of knowledge of pathophysiology, such as this, into better treatment for patients. The achievement of this 'mechanisms to management' transition is mature in cardiac failure, with knowledge of cardiac neural pathophysiology having led to introduction of beta-adrenergic blockers, an effective therapy. Perhaps we are now on the cusp of effective translation in patients with essential hypertension, with recent successful testing of selective catheter-based renal sympathetic nerve ablation in patients with resistant hypertension, an intervention firmly based on prior demonstration in them of activation of the renal sympathetic outflow.},

Medication regimen complexity-formulations, dosing frequencies, and additional directions-expands pill burden by considering self-care demands. Studies show an inverse association between {ARV} adherence and medication complexity for {ARVs} only. Patient-level medication regimen complexity beyond {ARV} complexity is unknown. {OBJECTIVE}: To measure and characterize Patient-level Medication Regimen Complexity Index ({pMRCI}) and Antiretroviral Medication Regimen Complexity Index ({ARCI}) for patients in 2 {HIV} clinics. We hypothesized that an all-medication complexity metric will exceed disease-state-defined complexity metrics; for {ARVs} only, the {pMRCI} score will be smaller than the {ARCI} score by capturing fewer features of regimens. Associations between complexity and adherence were not assessed. {METHOD}: Electronic records supplied a retrospective, random sample of adult patients with {HIV}; medication lists were used to code the {pMRCI} (n=200). A random subsample (n=66) was coded using {ARCI} for {ARV} regimens only. {RESULT}: Medication counts ranged from 1 to 27; {pMRCI} scores ranged from 2 to 67.5. {ARVs} contributed roughly 25\% to the {pMRCI}; other prescriptions contributed about 66\%. Dosing frequency made the largest contribution of all components (62\%) to the {pMRCI}. For {ARVs}, {pMRCI} and {ARCI} scores did not differ statistically. {CONCLUSION}: Unique dosing frequencies raised complexity and may provide opportunities for intervention. Other prescriptions drove {pMRCI} scores, suggesting that {HIV} management programs should review all medications. A patient-level approach added value to understanding the role of medications in patient complexity; future work can assess association of {pMRCI} with adherence and patient outcomes.},

Both white-coat and masked hypertension are frequent clinical entities that need appropriate recognition and a close diagnostic follow-up. White-coat and masked hypertension seem to be associated with organ damage and increased cardiovascular risk, although not invariably. In addition, patients with masked or white-coat hypertension have an increased risk of abnormalities affecting their glucose and lipid profiles. Therefore, the diagnosis of these conditions should be accurate and include the assessment of cardiovascular as well as of metabolic risk. Once diagnosed, first-line therapeutic interventions should be nonpharmacological and aim at lifestyle changes, but drug treatment can be indicated, particularly when the patient's cardiovascular risk profile is elevated or when target-organ damage is detected.},

	volume = {355},
	isbn = {1533-4406 (Electronic) 0028-4793 (Linking)},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000 but remains endemic worldwide. In 2005, a 17-year-old unvaccinated girl who was incubating measles returned from Romania, creating the largest documented outbreak of measles in the United States since 1996. {METHODS}: We conducted a case-series investigation, molecular typing of viral isolates, surveys of rates of vaccination coverage, interviews regarding attitudes toward vaccination, and cost surveys. {RESULTS}: Approximately 500 persons attended a gathering with the index patient one day after her return home. Approximately 50 lacked evidence of measles immunity, of whom 16 (32 percent) acquired measles at the gathering. During the six weeks after the gathering, a total of 34 cases of measles were confirmed. Of the patients with confirmed measles, 94 percent were unvaccinated, 88 percent were less than 20 years of age, and 9 percent were hospitalized. Of the 28 patients who were 5 to 19 years of age, 71 percent were home-schooled. Vaccine failure occurred in two persons. The virus strain was genotype D4, which is endemic in Romania. Although containment measures began after 20 persons were already infectious, measles remained confined mostly to children whose parents had refused to have them vaccinated, primarily out of concern for adverse events from the vaccine. Seventy-one percent of patients were from four households. Levels of measles-vaccination coverage in Indiana were 92 percent for preschoolers and 98 percent for sixth graders. Estimated costs of containing the disease were at least 167,685 dollars, including 113,647 dollars at a hospital with an infected employee. {CONCLUSIONS}: This outbreak was caused by the importation of measles into a population of children whose parents had refused to have them vaccinated because of safety concerns about the vaccine. High vaccination levels in the surrounding community and low rates of vaccine failure averted an epidemic. Maintenance of high rates of vaccination coverage, including improved strategies of communication with persons who refuse vaccination, is necessary to prevent future outbreaks and sustain the elimination of measles in the United States.},

	abstract = {In many forms of erectile dysfunction ({ED}), cardiovascular risk factors, in particular arterial hypertension, seem to be extremely common. While causes for {ED} are related to a broad spectrum of diseases, a generalized vascular process seems to be the underlying mechanism in many patients, which in a large portion of clinical cases involves endothelial dysfunction, ie, inadequate vasodilation in response to endothelium-dependent stimuli, both in the systemic vasculature and the penile arteries. Due to this close association of cardiovascular disease and {ED}, patients with {ED} should be evaluated as to whether they may suffer from cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, cardiovascular disease or silent myocardial ischemia. On the other hand, cardiovascular patients, seeking treatment of {ED}, must be evaluated in order to decide whether treatment of {ED} or sexual activity can be recommended without significantly increased cardiac risk. The guideline from the first and second Princeton Consensus Conference may be applied in this context. While consequent treatment of cardiovascular risk factors should be accomplished in these patients, many antihypertensive drugs may worsen sexual function as a drug specific side-effect. Importantly, effective treatment for arterial hypertension should not be discontinued as hypertension itself may contribute to altered sexual functioning; to the contrary, alternative antihypertensive regimes should be administered with individually tailored drug regimes with minimal side-effects on sexual function. When phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil, are prescribed to hypertensive patients on antihypertensive drugs, these combinations of antihypertensive drugs and phosphodiesterase 5 are usually well tolerated, provided there is a baseline blood pressure of at least 90/60 {mmHg}. However, there are two exceptions: nitric oxide donors and alpha-adrenoceptor blockers. Any drug serving as a nitric oxide donor (nitrates) is absolutely contraindicated in combination with phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, due to significant, potentially life threatening hypotension. Also, a-adrenoceptor blockers, such as doxazosin, terazosin and tamsulosin, should only be combined with phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors with special caution and close monitoring of blood pressure.},

Simulated patients' characteristics matched those of participants in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid-Lowering Arm and event probabilities were calculated with Framingham Heart Study risk equations. The real-world adherence scenario employed adherence data from an observational study of a {US} population; risk reductions at each level of adherence were based on linear extrapolations from clinical trials. Outputs included life expectancy, frequencies of primary and secondary coronary heart disease and stroke, and direct medical costs in 2006 {US}\$. The incremental cost per life-year gained and incremental cost per event avoided were calculated comparing the three adherence scenarios. {RESULTS}: Mean life expectancy was 14.73 years (no-treatment scenario), 15.07 (real-world adherence), and 15.49 (ideal adherence). The average number of cardiovascular events per patients was 0.738 (no treatment), 0.610 (real-world adherence), and 0.441 (ideal adherence). The incremental cost of real-world adherence versus no treatment is \$30,585 per life-year gained, and ideal adherence versus real-world adherence is \$22,121 per life-year gained. {CONCLUSIONS}: Hypertensive patients taking antihypertensive and statin therapy at real-world adherence levels can be expected to receive approximately 50\% of the potential benefit seen in clinical trials. Depending on its cost, the incremental benefits of an effective adherence intervention program could make it an attractive value.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: High blood pressure is an important public health concern because it is highly prevalent and a risk factor for adverse health outcomes, including coronary heart disease, stroke, decompensated heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and decline in cognitive function. Observational studies show a progressive increase in risk associated with blood pressure above 115/75 mm Hg. Prior research has shown that reducing elevated systolic blood pressure lowers the risk of subsequent clinical complications from cardiovascular disease. However, the optimal systolic blood pressure to reduce blood pressure-related adverse outcomes is unclear, and the benefit of treating to a level of systolic blood pressure well below 140 mm Hg has not been proven in a large, definitive clinical trial. {PURPOSE}: To describe the design considerations of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial ({SPRINT}) and the baseline characteristics of trial participants. {METHODS}: The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial that compares two strategies for treating systolic blood pressure: one targets the standard target of {\textless}140 mm Hg, and the other targets a more intensive target of {\textless}120 mm Hg. Enrollment focused on volunteers of age {\textgreater}/=50 years (no upper limit) with an average baseline systolic blood pressure {\textgreater}/=130 mm Hg and evidence of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, 10-year Framingham cardiovascular disease risk score {\textgreater}/=15\%, or age {\textgreater}/=75 years. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial recruitment also targeted three pre-specified subgroups: participants with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate {\textless}60 {mL}/min/1.73 m(2)), participants with a history of cardiovascular disease, and participants 75 years of age or older. The primary outcome is first the occurrence of a myocardial infarction ({MI}), acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, or cardiovascular disease death. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, decline in kidney function or development of end-stage renal disease, incident dementia, decline in cognitive function, and small-vessel cerebral ischemic disease. {RESULTS}: Between 8 November 2010 and 15 March 2013, Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial recruited and randomized 9361 people at 102 clinics, including 3331 women, 2648 with chronic kidney disease, 1877 with a history of cardiovascular disease, 3962 minorities, and 2636 {\textgreater}/=75 years of age. {LIMITATIONS}: Although the overall recruitment target was met, the numbers recruited in the high-risk subgroups were lower than planned. {CONCLUSIONS}: The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial will provide important information on the risks and benefits of intensive blood pressure treatment targets in a diverse sample of high-risk participants, including those with prior cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and those aged {\textgreater}/=75 years.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The prehypertension classification was introduced to facilitate prevention efforts among patients at increased risk for hypertension. Although patients who have been told that they have hypertension report worse outcomes than unaware hypertensives, little is known about whether or not prehypertension labeling has negative effects. We evaluated the effects of labeling individuals with prehypertension on blood pressure and health-related quality of life three months later. {METHODS}: One hundred adults (aged 19 to 82 [mean=40.0] years; 54\% women; 64\% racial/ethnic minorities) with screening blood pressure in the prehypertensive range (120-139/80-89 {mmHg}) and no history of diagnosis or treatment of elevated blood pressure were randomly assigned to either a "Labeled" group in which they were informed of their prehypertension, or an "Unlabeled" group in which they were not informed. Subjects underwent office blood pressure measurement, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and completed self-report questionnaires at baseline and at three months. {RESULTS}: Multilevel mixed effects regression analyses indicated that changes in the white coat effect, office blood pressure, mean daytime ambulatory blood pressure, and physical and mental health did not differ significantly between the two groups. Adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity and body mass index did not affect the results. {CONCLUSION}: These findings suggest that labeling patients with prehypertension does not have negative effects on blood pressure or quality of life. Additional research is needed to develop approaches to communicating with patients about their blood pressure that will maximize the clinical and public health impact of the prehypertension classification.},

There was evidence of some differences between active regimens in their effects on cause-specific outcomes. For every outcome other than heart failure, the difference between randomised groups in achieved blood pressure reduction was directly related to the observed difference in risk.{\textbar}Treatment with any commonly-used regimen reduces the risk of total major cardiovascular events, and larger reductions in blood pressure produce larger reductions in risk.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Uncontrolled hypertension under antihypertensive multidrug regimen is not necessarily always true resistance. Incomplete adherence is one of several possible causes of uncontrolled hypertension. Nonadherence remains largely unrecognized and is falsely interpreted as treatment resistance, as it is difficult to confirm or exclude objectively. This is the first study assessing adherence in patients with apparent resistant hypertension systematically via toxicological urine screening. {METHODS}: All patients referred from primary care physicians because of uncontrolled hypertension between 2004 and 2011 were analysed. Adherence was assessed in all patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite the concurrent use of at least four antihypertensive agents by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis for antihypertensive drugs or their corresponding metabolites in urine. {RESULTS}: A total of 375 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were referred. After optimization of drug therapy and exclusion of white coat hypertension, 108 patients met criteria for resistant hypertension. Of those, 15 patients had secondary causes of hypertension and 17 achieved goal blood pressure with quadruple antihypertensive therapy. Of the remaining 76 patients, 40 patients (53\%) were found to be nonadherent. Among nonadherent patients, 30\% had complete and 70\% had incomplete adherence; 85\% of the latter had taken less than 50\% of drugs prescribed. Lack of adherence was almost evenly distributed between different classes of antihypertensive drugs. {CONCLUSION}: Low adherence was the most common cause of poor blood pressure control in patients with apparent resistant hypertension, being twice as frequent as secondary causes of hypertension. Incomplete adherence was far more common than complete nonadherence; thus, assessment of adherence in patients on multiple drug regime is only reliable when all drugs are included in assessment. Assessing adherence by toxicological urine screening is a useful tool in detecting low adherence, especially in the setting of multidrug regimen as a cause of apparently resistant hypertension.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Although populations referred for coronary angiography are increasingly diverse, there is limited information on coronary artery disease ({CAD}) prevalence and in-hospital mortality other than for predominately white male patients. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We examined gender and ethnic differences in {CAD} prevalence and in-hospital mortality in a prospective cohort of patients referred for angiographic evaluation of stable angina (n=375,886) or acute coronary syndromes ({ACS}; unstable angina or myocardial infarction, n=450,329) at 388 {US} hospitals participating in the American College of Cardiology-National Cardiovascular Data Registry, an angiographic registry. Univariable and multivariable (with covariates that included risk factors, symptoms, and comorbidities) logistic regression models were used to estimate significant {CAD}, defined as {\textgreater} or = 70\% stenosis, and in-hospital mortality. Within stable angina and {ACS} cohorts, 7\% of patients were black, 2\% were Hispanic, 0.3\% were Native American, 1\% were Asian, and 90\% were white, respectively. In stable angina, the risk-adjusted {OR} for significant {CAD} was 0.34 for women compared with men (P{\textless}0.0001), with black women having the lowest risk-adjusted odds (P{\textless}0.0001) compared with other females. Among {ACS} patients, the risk-adjusted {OR} of significant {CAD} was 0.47 for women compared with men (P{\textless}0.0001); similarly, black women had the lowest risk-adjusted odds (P{\textless}0.0001) compared with other females. Higher in-hospital mortality was reported for white women presenting with stable angina (P{\textless}0.00001). White women had a 1.34-fold (95\% {CI} 1.21 to 1.48) higher risk-adjusted odds ratio for mortality than white men with stable angina (P{\textless}0.0001), with higher rates noted for white women who were older or had significant {CAD} (both P{\textless}0.0001). Lower utilization of elective coronary revascularization, aspirin, and glycoprotein {IIb}/{IIIa} inhibitors (all P{\textless}0.0001) may have contributed to higher in-hospital mortality for white women. In {ACS}, higher in-hospital mortality was reported for Hispanic (P=0.015) and white (P{\textless}0.0001) women; however, neither white (P=0.51) or Hispanic (P=0.13) women had higher in-hospital risk-adjusted mortality. {CONCLUSIONS}: The likelihood for significant {CAD} at coronary angiography and for in-hospital mortality varied significantly by ethnicity and gender. Future clinical practice guidelines should be tailored to gender subsets of the population, in particular for black women, to improve the efficient use of angiographic laboratories and to target at-risk populations of women and men.},

Our goal was to identify temporal trends among {US} adolescents in the severity of {MetS}, its individual components, and factors related to diet and physical activity. {METHODS}: We analyzed 5117 participants aged 12 to 19 from {NHANES}. We used regression analysis of individual waves of data, 1999 to 2012. {MetS} severity was calculated using a gender- and race/ethnicity-specific {MetS} severity z score. {RESULTS}: There was a linear trend of decreasing {MetS} severity in {US} adolescents from 1999 to 2012 (P = .030). This occurred despite a trend of increasing {BMI} z score (P = .005); instead, the decrease in {MetS} severity appeared to be due to trends in increasing high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}; P {\textless} .0001) and decreasing triglyceride (P = .0001) levels. In considering lifestyle factors, there was no change in physical activity over the time period. Regarding dietary patterns, total calorie consumption and carbohydrate consumption were positively associated with triglyceride levels and negatively associated with {HDL} levels, whereas unsaturated fat consumption exhibited the opposite associations. Consistent with these associations, there was a trend of decreasing total calorie consumption (P {\textless} .0001), decreasing carbohydrate consumption (P {\textless} .0001), and increasing unsaturated fat consumption (P = .002). {CONCLUSIONS}: The healthier trend of declining {MetS} severity in adolescents appeared to be due to favorable increases in {HDL} and decreases in fasting triglyceride measurements. These were in turn associated with favorable changes in dietary patterns among {US} adolescents. Future studies should investigate the causality of dietary differences on changes in {MetS} severity in adolescents.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This study evaluated the accuracy of 2 administrative claims-based selection rules to identify patients with hypertension ({HTN}) using medical records as the gold standard. {RESEARCH} {DESIGN}: The claims database consisted of inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and eligibility claims for members of a single insurance company from January 2000 through March 2003. Medical records were abstracted for 258 matched patient pairs selected by Rule A (at least 1 {HTN}-related International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision [{ICD}-9] claim) and 138 pairs selected by Rule B (at least 1 {HTN}-related {ICD}-9 and at least 1 {HTN} prescription claim) from 31 provider sites. Sensitivity and specificity of the 2 selection rules were computed using medical chart review as the gold standard for a diagnosis of {HTN}. {SUBJECTS}: Of patients selected by Rule A, chart review identified 281 patients with and 235 patients without {HTN}. Of patients selected by Rule B, chart review identified 172 patients with and 104 patients without {HTN}. {RESULTS}: The sensitivity and specificity was 70.8\% and 74.9\% for Rule A and 76.2\% and 93.3\% for Rule B. The kappa score was 0.45 for Rule A and 0.65 for Rule B. {CONCLUSION}: To identify patients with {HTN}, a selection rule using both a diagnosis and prescription claim has greater sensitivity and specificity than a rule using a diagnosis claim only.},

Patients self-completed the {EQ}-5D and {SF}-12 questionnaires, and a simple measure of disability (Rankin). Cardiovascular co-morbidities were collected and number of drugs used as an additional proxy for co-morbidity. Quality-of-life outcomes were compared with general population samples of the same age. On multiple regression, female gender, greater medication use, and disability were independently associated with lower {QoL} scores in {AF}. Those in {AF} with a Rankin score {\textgreater}/=2 had lower {QoL} scores, while those with a Rankin score {\textless}2 had higher scores than the general population. Increasing co-morbidity was associated with reduced {QoL} scores, with the {EQ}-5D and {SF}-12 Physical Component Score showing similar sensitivity to these associations, and the {SF}-12 Mental Component Score showing less sensitivity. {CONCLUSION}: In the absence of co-morbidity, chronic {AF} has little impact on generic {QoL} in an elderly non-acutely ill population.},

Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined differences in health-related quality of life with adjustment for age, race, sex, healthcare coverage, and other medical conditions. {RESULTS}: The 30\% of respondents with hypertension were more likely to report fair or poor health status (adjusted odds ratio 1.72, 95\% confidence interval 1.44-2.05), 14 or more unhealthy days in the past 30 days (1.23, 1.06-1.43), 14 or more physically unhealthy days (1.39, 1.15-1.67), and 14 or more activity-limited days (1.55, 1.17-2.04) than those without hypertension. Among adults with hypertension, the 73.2\% who were aware of their condition were more likely to report fair or poor health status (2.19, 1.54-3.12), 14 or more unhealthy days (1.53, 1.12-2.09), 14 or more physically unhealthy days (1.49, 1.10-2.03), 14 or more mentally unhealthy days (1.70, 1.05-2.75), and 14 or more activity-limited days (2.38, 1.39-4.05) than those who were unaware.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may attenuate the antihypertensive effects of diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, central alpha-agonists, and other vasodilators. Their effects on the antihypertensive efficacy of calcium channel blockers are inadequately studied in small numbers of patients but appear to be minimal. {METHODS}: A three-phase, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study included 162 patients aged 18 to 75 years with essential hypertension. After diastolic blood pressure was controlled to 90 mm Hg or less with once-daily verapamil hydrochloride, patients received ibuprofen, naproxen, or placebo matching capsules for 3 weeks, and blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and adverse effects were evaluated. A general linear model with 95\% confidence intervals was used to compare each nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment group with the placebo group. {RESULTS}: No significant differences in sitting, standing, or supine blood pressure were noted with naproxen or ibuprofen compared with placebo. The percentages of patients in each treatment group with increases of 10 mm Hg or more in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure were similar. Statistically significant increases in weight were seen with both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapies. Changes in pulse rate were not significant. The incidence of adverse effects was similar across all three treatment groups. {CONCLUSIONS}: The addition of naproxen or ibuprofen to the treatment of hypertensive patients in whom blood pressure is controlled by once-daily verapamil does not cause an increase in blood pressure. Verapamil may therefore offer considerable advantages in maintaining control of blood pressure in patients who regularly receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Case reports indicate that the use of fluoroquinolones may lead to acute kidney injury. We studied the association between the use of oral fluoroquinolones and acute kidney injury, and we examined interaction with renin-angiotensin-system blockers. {METHODS}: We formed a nested cohort of men aged 40-85 enrolled in the United States {IMS} {LifeLink} Health Plan Claims Database between 2001 and 2011. We defined cases as men admitted to hospital for acute kidney injury, and controls were admitted to hospital with a different presenting diagnosis. Using risk-set sampling, we matched 10 controls to each case based on hospital admission, calendar time (within 6 wk), cohort entrance (within 6 wk) and age (within 5 yr). We used conditional logistic regression to assess the rate ratio ({RR}) for acute kidney injury with current, recent and past use of fluoroquinolones, adjusted by potential confounding variables. We repeated this analysis with amoxicillin and azithromycin as controls. We used a case-time-control design for our secondary analysis. {RESULTS}: We identified 1292 cases and 12 651 matched controls. Current fluoroquinolone use had a 2.18-fold (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.74-2.73) higher adjusted {RR} of acute kidney injury compared with no use. There was no association between acute kidney injury and recent (adjusted {RR} 0.87, 95\% {CI} 0.66-1.16) or past ({RR} 0.86, 95\% {CI} 0.66-1.12) use. The absolute increase in acute kidney injury was 6.5 events per 10 000 person-years. We observed 1 additional case per 1529 patients given fluoroquinolones or per 3287 prescriptions dispensed. The dual use of fluoroquinolones and renin-angiotensin-system blockers had an {RR} of 4.46 (95\% {CI} 2.84-6.99) for acute kidney injury. Our case-time-control analysis confirmed an increased risk of acute kidney injury with fluoroquinolone use ({RR} 2.16, 95\% {CI} 1.52-3.18). The use of amoxicillin or azithromycin was not associated with acute kidney injury. {INTERPRETATION}: We found a small, but significant, increased risk of acute kidney injury among men with the use of oral fluoroquinolones, as well as a significant interaction between the concomitant use of fluoroquinolones and renin-angiotensin-system blockers.},

	abstract = {Background: The objective of most biomedical research is to determine an unbiased estimate of effect for an exposure on an outcome, i.e. to make causal inferences about the exposure. Recent developments in epidemiology have shown that traditional methods of identifying confounding and adjusting for confounding may be inadequate. Discussion: The traditional methods of adjusting for "potential confounders" may introduce conditional associations and bias rather than minimize it. Although previous published articles have discussed the role of the causal directed acyclic graph approach ({DAGs}) with respect to confounding, many clinical problems require complicated {DAGs} and therefore investigators may continue to use traditional practices because they do not have the tools necessary to properly use the {DAG} approach. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate a simple 6-step approach to the use of {DAGs}, and also to explain why the method works from a conceptual point of view. Summary: Using the simple 6-step {DAG} approach to confounding and selection bias discussed is likely to reduce the degree of bias for the effect estimate in the chosen statistical model.},

The following are the key messages(1) In persons older than 50 years, systolic blood pressure ({BP}) of more than 140 mm Hg is a much more important cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) risk factor than diastolic {BP}; (2) The risk of {CVD}, beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, doubles with each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; individuals who are normotensive at 55 years of age have a 90\% lifetime risk for developing hypertension; (3) Individuals with a systolic {BP} of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic {BP} of 80 to 89 mm Hg should be considered as prehypertensive and require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent {CVD}; (4) Thiazide-type diuretics should be used in drug treatment for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes. Certain high-risk conditions are compelling indications for the initial use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most patients with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve goal {BP} ({\textless}140/90 mm Hg, or {\textless}130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If {BP} is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal {BP}, consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 2 agents, 1 of which usually should be a thiazide-type diuretic; and (7) The most effective therapy prescribed by the most careful clinician will control hypertension only if patients are motivated. Motivation improves when patients have positive experiences with and trust in the clinician. Empathy builds trust and is a potent motivator. Finally, in presenting these guidelines, the committee recognizes that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.},

These types of minimally intensive approaches are important to test in all populations, especially those experiencing related health disparities, for broad implementation with limited resources. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: The New York City Health Department in partnership with community clinic networks implemented a randomized clinical trial (n=900, 450 per arm) to investigate the effectiveness of self-blood pressure monitoring in medically underserved and largely black and Hispanic participants. Intervention participants received a home blood pressure monitor and training on use, whereas control participants received usual care. After 9 months, systolic blood pressure decreased (intervention, 14.7 mm Hg; control, 14.1 mm Hg; P=0.70). Similar results were observed when incorporating longitudinal data and calculating a mean slope over time. Control was achieved in 38.9\% of intervention and 39.1\% of control participants at the end of follow-up; the time-to-event experience of achieving blood pressure control in the intervention versus control groups were not different from each other (logrank P value =0.91). {CONCLUSIONS}: Self-blood pressure monitoring was not shown to improve control over usual care in this largely minority, urban population. The patient population in this study, which included a high proportion of Hispanics and uninsured persons, is understudied. Results indicate these groups may have additional meaningful barriers to achieving blood pressure control beyond access to the monitor itself. {CLINICAL} {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: http://clinicaltrials.gov.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: "Clinical inertia" has been defined as inaction by physicians caring for patients with uncontrolled risk factors such as blood pressure. Some have proposed that it accounts for up to 80\% of cardiovascular events, potentially an important quality problem. However, reasons for so-called clinical inertia are poorly understood. {OBJECTIVE}: To derive an empiric conceptual model of clinical inertia as a subset of all clinical inactions from the physician perspective. {METHODS}: We used Nominal Group panels of practicing physicians to identify reasons why they do not intensify medications when seeing an established patient with uncontrolled blood pressure. {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: We stopped at 2 groups (N = 6 and 7, respectively) because of the high degree of agreement on reasons for not intensifying, indicating saturation. A third group of clinicians (N = 9) independently sorted the reasons generated by the Nominal Groups. Using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, we translated the sorting results into a cognitive map that represents an empirically derived model of clinical inaction from the physician's perspective. The model shows that much inaction may in fact be clinically appropriate care. {CONCLUSIONS}/{RECOMMENDATIONS}: Many reasons offered by physicians for not intensifying medications suggest that low rates of intensification do not necessarily reflect poor quality of care. The empirically derived model of clinical inaction can be used as a guide to construct performance measures for monitoring clinical inertia that better focus on true quality problems.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To study factors associated with therapeutic inertia in treating hypertension and to develop a predictive model to estimate the probability of therapeutic inertia in a given medical consultation, based on variables related to the consultation, patient, physician, clinical characteristics, and level of care. {METHODS}: National, multicentre, observational, cross-sectional study in primary care and specialist (hospital) physicians who each completed a questionnaire on therapeutic inertia, provided professional data and collected clinical data on four patients. Therapeutic inertia was defined as a consultation in which treatment change was indicated (i.e., {SBP} {\textgreater}or= 140 or {DBP} {\textgreater}or= 90 {mmHg} in all patients; {SBP} {\textgreater}or= 130 or {DBP} {\textgreater}or= 80 in patients with diabetes or stroke), but did not occur. A predictive model was constructed and validated according to the factors associated with therapeutic inertia. {RESULTS}: Data were collected on 2595 patients and 13,792 visits. Therapeutic inertia occurred in 7546 (75\%) of the 10,041 consultations in which treatment change was indicated. Factors associated with therapeutic inertia were primary care setting, male sex, older age, {SPB} and/or {DBP} values close to normal, treatment with more than one antihypertensive drug, treatment with an {ARB} {II}, and more than six visits/year. Physician characteristics did not weigh heavily in the association. The predictive model was valid internally and externally, with acceptable calibration, discrimination and reproducibility, and explained one-third of the variability in therapeutic inertia. {CONCLUSION}: Although therapeutic inertia is frequent in the management of hypertension, the factors explaining it are not completely clear. Whereas some aspects of the consultations were associated with therapeutic inertia, physician characteristics were not a decisive factor.},

Treatment with amiodarone or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ({ICD}) has been proposed to improve the prognosis in such patients. {METHODS}: We randomly assigned 2521 patients with New York Heart Association ({NYHA}) class {II} or {III} {CHF} and a left ventricular ejection fraction ({LVEF}) of 35 percent or less to conventional therapy for {CHF} plus placebo (847 patients), conventional therapy plus amiodarone (845 patients), or conventional therapy plus a conservatively programmed, shock-only, single-lead {ICD} (829 patients). Placebo and amiodarone were administered in a double-blind fashion. The primary end point was death from any cause. {RESULTS}: The median {LVEF} in patients was 25 percent; 70 percent were in {NYHA} class {II}, and 30 percent were in class {III} {CHF}. The cause of {CHF} was ischemic in 52 percent and nonischemic in 48 percent. The median follow-up was 45.5 months. There were 244 deaths (29 percent) in the placebo group, 240 (28 percent) in the amiodarone group, and 182 (22 percent) in the {ICD} group. As compared with placebo, amiodarone was associated with a similar risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.06; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.30; P=0.53) and {ICD} therapy was associated with a decreased risk of death of 23 percent (0.77; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.96; P=0.007) and an absolute decrease in mortality of 7.2 percentage points after five years in the overall population.

The effectiveness of diltiazem, a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, in reducing cardiovascular morbidity or mortality is unclear. We compared the effects of diltiazem with that of diuretics, beta-blockers, or both on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. {METHODS}: In a prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint study, we enrolled 10,881 patients, aged 50-74 years, at health centres in Norway and Sweden, who had diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more. We randomly assigned patients diltiazem, or diuretics, beta-blockers, or both. The combined primary endpoint was fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death. Analysis was done by intention to treat. {FINDINGS}: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lowered effectively in the diltiazem and diuretic and beta-blocker groups (reduction 20.3/18.7 vs 23.3/18.7 mm Hg; difference in systolic reduction p{\textless}0.001).

Disability is an important measure of health and an estimate of the risk of disability as a result of diabetes is crucial in view of the global diabetes epidemic. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate this risk. {METHODS}: We searched Ovid, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature up to Aug 8, 2012. We included studies of adults that compared the risk of disability-as measured by activities of daily living ({ADL}), instrumental activities of daily living ({IADL}), or mobility-in people with and without any type of diabetes. We excluded studies of subpopulations with specific illnesses or of people in nursing homes. From the studies, we recorded population characteristics, how diabetes was diagnosed (by doctor or self-reported), domain and definition of disability, and risk estimates for disability. We calculated pooled estimates by disability type and type of risk estimate (odds ratio [{OR}] or risk ratio [{RR}]). {RESULTS}: Our systematic review returned 3224 results, from which 26 studies were included in our meta-analyses. Diabetes increased the risk of mobility disability (15 studies; {OR} 1.71, 95\% {CI} 1.53-1.91; {RR} 1.51, 95\% {CI} 1.38-1.64), of {IADL} disability (ten studies; {OR} 1.65, 95\% {CI} 1.55-1.74), and of {ADL} disability (16 studies; {OR} 1.82, 95\% {CI} 1.63-2.04; {RR} 1.82, 95\% {CI} 1.40-2.36). {INTERPRETATION}: Diabetes is associated with a strong increase in the risk of physical disability. Efforts to promote healthy ageing should account for this risk through prevention and management of diabetes. {FUNDING}: Monash University, Baker {IDI} Bright Sparks Foundation, Australian Postgraduate Award, {VicHealth}, National Health and Medical Research Council, Australian Research Council, Victorian Government.},

In addition, we also compared clinical features of patients with true or white-coat-resistant hypertension. In December 2009, we identified 68 045 treated patients with complete information for this analysis. Among them, 8295 (12.2\% of the database) had resistant hypertension (office blood pressure ≥140 and/or 90 mm Hg while being treated with ≥3 antihypertensive drugs, 1 of them being a diuretic). After ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 62.5\% of patients were classified as true resistant hypertensives, the remaining 37.5\% having white-coat resistance. The former group was younger, more frequently men, with a longer duration of hypertension and a worse cardiovascular risk profile. The group included larger proportions of smokers, diabetics, target organ damage (including left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired renal function, and microalbuminuria), and documented cardiovascular disease. Moreover, true resistant hypertensives exhibited in a greater proportion a riser pattern (22\% versus 18\%; P{\textless}0.001). In conclusion, this study first reports the prevalence of resistant hypertension in a large cohort of patients in usual daily practice. Resistant hypertension is present in 12\% of the treated hypertensive population, but among them more than one third have normal ambulatory blood pressure. A worse risk profile is associated with true resistant hypertension, but this association is weak, thus making it necessary to assess ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for a correct diagnosis and management.},

	abstract = {Obese patients are prone to arterial hypertension, require more antihypertensive medications, and have an increased risk of treatment-resistant arterial hypertension. Obesity-induced neurohumoral activation appears to be involved. The association between obesity and hypertension shows large inter-individual variability, likely through genetic mechanisms. Obesity affects overall cardiovascular and metabolic risk; yet, the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular risk is complex and not sufficiently addressed in clinical guidelines. The epidemiological observation that obesity may be protective in patients with established cardiovascular disease is difficult to translate into clinical experience and practice. Weight loss is often recommended as a means to lower blood pressure. However, current hypertension guidelines do not provide evidence-based guidance on how to institute weight loss. In fact, weight loss influences on blood pressure may be overestimated. Nevertheless, weight loss through bariatric surgery appears to decrease cardiovascular risk in severely obese patients. Eventually, most obese hypertensive patients will require antihypertensive medications. Data from large-scale studies with hard clinical endpoints on antihypertensive medications specifically addressing obese patients are lacking and the morbidity from the growing population of severely obese patients is poorly recognized or addressed. Because of their broad spectrum of beneficial effects, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are considered to be the most appropriate drugs for antihypertensive treatment of obese patients. Most obese hypertensive patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs. Finally, how to combine weight loss strategies and antihypertensive treatment to achieve an optimal clinical outcome is unresolved.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: With growing awareness of arterial stiffness ({AS}) in the past 10 years, it was realized that resistant hypertension ({RH}) and {AS} share the same associated conditions such as older age, isolated systolic hypertension ({HT}), obesity, chronic kidney disease ({CKD}), and so on. Until now, there is no study investigating the role of {AS} in {RH}. In our study we aimed to determine whether there is an association between {RH} and {AS}. {METHODS}: Among 87 patients enrolled in this study, 30 were resistant hypertensives (Group 1), 29 were controlled hypertensives (Group 2), and 28 were normotensives (Group 3). Arterial stiffness was measured by both applanation tonometry and echocardiography; augmentation index, pulse wave velocity ({PWV}), aortic strain, and aortic distensibility were recorded in each patient. Diastolic function parameters were also assessed. {RESULTS}: In resistant hypertensive group, augmentation index and {PWV} were significantly higher than Group 2 and Group 3 (P = .03 and P {\textless} .01). Aortic strain and aortic distensibility parameters were significantly lower in {RH} group (P {\textless} .01 and P {\textless} .01). Arterial stiffness parameters were similar among Group 2 and Group 3. Among diastolic function parameters, left atrial volume index and left ventricular mass index significantly differ between groups. These two parameters were significantly lower in control group (P {\textless} .01 and P = .02) whereas similar in Group 1 and Group 2. Systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) and diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}) levels were significantly different between groups as expected. When the correlation between two methods of {AS} was analyzed, a significant strong inverse correlation was found between echocardiographic and tonometric parameters. {CONCLUSION}: Arterial stiffness was found to be associated with {RH}. The inconsistency of this association in controlled hypertensives suggests a possible role of {AS} in {RH} pathogenesis. This study also showed that aortic strain and distensibility correlate well with the {PWV} which is the gold standard in the assessment of {AS}. This finding is important for the evaluation of {AS} more commonly in daily practice as echocardiography is a more feasible device than applanation tonometry.},

The aims of these overview analyses were to quantify the effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment in each sex and to determine if there are important differences in the proportional benefits of treatment between men and women. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Thirty-one randomized trials that included 103,268 men and 87,349 women contributed to these analyses. For each outcome and each comparison summary estimates of effect and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated for men and women using a random-effects model. The consistency of the effects of each treatment regimen across the sexes was examined using chi(2) tests of homogeneity. Achieved blood pressure reductions were comparable for men and women in every comparison made. For the primary outcome of total major cardiovascular events there was no evidence that men and women obtained different levels of protection from blood pressure lowering or that regimens based on angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, angiotensin receptor blockers, or diuretics/beta-blockers were more effective in one sex than the other (all P-homogeneity {\textgreater} 0.08). {CONCLUSION}: All of the blood pressure-lowering regimens studied here provided broadly similar protection against major cardiovascular events in men and women. Differences in cardiovascular risks between sexes are unlikely to reflect differences in response to blood pressure-lowering treatments.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Pharmacist-physician comanagement of hypertension has been shown to improve office blood pressures ({BPs}). We sought to describe the effect of such a model on 24-hour ambulatory {BPs}. {METHODS}: We performed a prospective, cluster-randomized, controlled clinical trial, enrolling 179 patients with uncontrolled hypertension from 5 primary care clinics in Iowa City, Iowa. Patients were randomized by clinic to receive pharmacist-physician collaborative management of hypertension (intervention) or usual care (control) for a 9-month period. In the intervention group, pharmacists helped patients to identify barriers to {BP} control, counseled on lifestyle and dietary modifications, and adjusted antihypertensive therapy in collaboration with the patients' primary care providers. Patients were seen by pharmacists a minimum of every 2 months. Ambulatory {BP} was measured at baseline and at study end. {RESULTS}: Baseline and end-of-study ambulatory {BP} profiles were evaluated for 175 patients. Mean ({SD}) ambulatory systolic {BPs} ({SBPs}), reported in millimeters of mercury, were reduced more in the intervention group than in the control group: daytime change in (Delta) {SBP}, 15.2 (11.5) vs 5.5 (13.5) (P {\textless} .001); nighttime {DeltaSBP}, 12.2 (14.8) vs 3.4 (13.3) (P {\textless} .001); and 24-hour {DeltaSBP}, 14.1 (11.3) vs 5.5 (12.5) (P {\textless} .001). More patients in the intervention group than in the control group had their {BP} controlled at the end of the study (75.0\% vs 50.7\%) (P {\textless} .001), as defined by overall 24-hour ambulatory {BP} monitoring. {CONCLUSION}: Pharmacist-physician collaborative management of hypertension achieved consistent and significantly greater reduction in 24-hour {BP} and a high rate of {BP} control.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: The aim of this study was to assess clinical safety and efficacy outcomes of renal denervation executed by an externally delivered, completely noninvasive focused therapeutic ultrasound device. {BACKGROUND}: Renal denervation has emerged as a potential treatment approach for resistant hypertension. {METHODS}: Sixty-nine subjects received renal denervation with externally delivered focused ultrasound via the Kona Medical Surround Sound System. This approach was investigated across 3 consecutive studies to optimize targeting, tracking, and dosing. In the third study, treatments were performed in a completely noninvasive way using duplex ultrasound image guidance to target the therapy. Short- and long-term safety and efficacy were evaluated through use of clinical assessments, magnetic resonance imaging scans prior to and 3 and 24 weeks after renal denervation, and, in cases in which a targeting catheter was used to facilitate targeting, fluoroscopic angiography with contrast. {RESULTS}: All patients tolerated renal denervation using externally delivered focused ultrasound. Office blood pressure ({BP}) decreased by 24.6 +/- 27.6/9.0 +/- 15.0 mm Hg (from baseline {BP} of 180.0 +/- 18.5/97.7 +/- 13.7 mm Hg) in 69 patients after 6 months and 23.8 +/- 24.1/10.3 +/- 13.1 mm Hg in 64 patients with complete 1-year follow-up. The response rate ({BP} decrease {\textgreater}10 mm Hg) was 75\% after 6 months and 77\% after 1 year. The most common adverse event was post-treatment back pain, which was reported in 32 of 69 patients and resolved within 72 h in most cases. No intervention-related adverse events involving motor or sensory deficits were reported. Renal function was not altered, and vascular safety was established by magnetic resonance imaging (all patients), fluoroscopic angiography (n = 48), and optical coherence tomography (n = 5). {CONCLUSIONS}: Using externally delivered focused ultrasound and noninvasive duplex ultrasound, image-guided targeting was associated with substantial {BP} reduction without any major safety signals. Further randomized, sham-controlled trials will be needed to validate this unique approach.},

The frequently used ratio for dialysis has, however, not been updated to reflect more recently available data on dialysis.{\textbar}We developed a computer simulation model for the end-stage renal disease population and compared cost, life expectancy, and quality adjusted life expectancy of current dialysis practice relative to three less costly alternatives and to no dialysis. We estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for these alternatives relative to the next least costly alternative and no dialysis and analyzed the population distribution of the ratios. Model parameters and costs were estimated using data from the Medicare population and a large integrated health-care delivery system between 1996 and 2003. The sensitivity of results to model assumptions was tested using 38 scenarios of one-way sensitivity analysis, where parameters informing the cost, utility, mortality and morbidity, etc. components of the model were by perturbed +/-50\%.{\textbar}The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dialysis of current practice relative to the next least costly alternative is on average \$129,090 per quality-adjusted life-year ({QALY}) (\$61,294 per year), but its distribution within the population is wide; the interquartile range is \$71,890 per {QALY}, while the 1st and 99th percentiles are \$65,496 and \$488,360 per {QALY}, respectively. Higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were associated with older age and more comorbid conditions.

We compared the incidence of {AEs} by classes of drugs employed in monotherapy and identified risk factors for the occurrence of {AEs} in a logistic regression model. {RESULTS}: Participants were followed for 12.3 +/- 12.2 months. In total, 534 (35.4\%) of 1,366 patients treated with blood pressure drugs complained of at least one {AE} during the follow-up, corresponding to an incidence of 31.3 {AEs} per 1,000 patients/month [95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 28.6-33.9). The systolic blood pressure in the initial evaluation (P = 0.002) and use of two or more drugs (P {\textless} 0.001) were associated with higher incidence of {AEs}. The incidence of {AEs} was higher among patients treated with calcium channel blockers in monotherapy than in patients treated with diuretics (47.2 vs. 7.6\%, P {\textless} 0.001). {CONCLUSION}: Adverse events of blood-pressure-lowering drugs are quite frequent in a clinical context, and may influence the adherence to treatment.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: This population-based study assessed rates of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke for up to 12 years of follow-up in 3.5 million Canadian adults newly diagnosed with hypertension. {METHODS}: Hypertension cohort, outcomes, and covariates were defined using validated case definitions applied to inpatient and outpatient administrative health databases. Factors associated with each outcome were identified using Cox proportional hazards models. {RESULTS}: Of 3,531,089 adults newly diagnosed with hypertension and without a previous history of cardiovascular disease, 29.4\% were younger than 50 years of age; 48.2\% were male, and 17.2\% resided in a rural area. Over a median follow-up length of 6.1 years, the crude all-cause mortality rate was 22.4 per 1000 person-years. The incidence of hospitalized myocardial infarction (8.4 per 1000 person-years) and hospitalized heart failure (8.5 per 1000 person-years) was higher than stroke (6.9 per 1000 person-years). The incidence rate for any cardiovascular hospitalization was 19.3 per 1000 person-years. Older age, male sex, lower income, rural residence, and a higher number of Charlson comorbidities were each independently associated with a higher risk of mortality and incident cardiovascular disease hospitalizations. {CONCLUSIONS}: In a nationally-representative incident cohort of hypertensive adults we have demonstrated higher mortality rates and poorer outcomes for the elderly, males, and those living in rural or low income locations. Innovative approaches to the provision of care for these high-risk individuals will lead to improved patient outcomes.},

The role of out-of-clinic recordings of {BP} in predicting end-stage renal disease ({ESRD}) and death in patients with {CKD} is unknown. A prospective cohort study was conducted in 217 Veterans with {CKD}. {BP} was measured at home and in the clinic by 'routine' and standardized methods. Patients were followed over a median of 3.5 years to assess the end points of total mortality, {ESRD} or the composite outcome of {ESRD} or death. Home {BP} was 147.0+/-21.4/78.3+/-11.6 {mmHg} and clinic {BPs} were 155.2+/-25.6/84.7+/-14.2 {mmHg} by standardized method and 144.5+/-24.2/75.4+/-14.7 {mmHg} by the 'routine' method. The composite renal end point occurred in 75 patients (34.5\%), death in 52 patients (24.0\%), and {ESRD} in 36/178 patients (20.2\%). One standard deviation (s.d.) increase in systolic {BP} increased the risk of renal end point by 1.27 (95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.01-1.60) for routine clinic measurement, by 1.69 (95\% {CI} 1.32-2.17) for standardized clinic measurement and by 1.84 (95\% {CI} 1.46-2.32) for home {BP} recording. One s.d. increase in home systolic {BP} increased the risk of {ESRD} by 1.74 (95\% {CI} 1.04-2.93) when adjusted for standardized clinic systolic {BP}, proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and other risk factors. In patients with {CKD}, {BPs} obtained at home are a stronger predictor of {ESRD} or death compared to {BPs} obtained in the clinic. Systolic home {BP} is an independent predictor for {ESRD}.},

	abstract = {Objective: One promise of nationwide adoption of electronic health records ({EHRs}) is the availability of data for large-scale clinical research studies. However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single site might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, meaning that critical events could be missing. In this study, we evaluate how simple heuristic checks for data "completeness" affect the number of patients in the resulting cohort and introduce potential biases. Materials and Methods: We began with a set of 16 filters that check for the presence of demographics, laboratory tests, and other types of data, and then systematically applied all 216 possible combinations of these filters to the {EHR} data for 12 million patients at 7 health care systems and a separate payor claims database of 7 million members. Results: {EHR} data showed considerable variability in data completeness across sites and high correlation between data types. For example, the fraction of patients with diagnoses increased from 35.0\% in all patients to 90.9\% in those with at least 1 medication. An unrelated claims dataset independently showed that most filters select members who are older and more likely female and can eliminate large portions of the population whose data are actually complete. Discussion and Conclusion: As investigators design studies, they need to balance their confidence in the completeness of the data with the effects of placing requirements on the data on the resulting patient cohort.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate on a large scale, across 272 common types of laboratory tests, the impact of healthcare processes on the predictive value of electronic health record ({EHR}) data.

Design Retrospective observational study.

Setting Two large hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, with inpatient, emergency, and ambulatory care.

Participants All 669 452 patients treated at the two hospitals over one year between 2005 and 2006.

Main outcome measures The relative predictive accuracy of each laboratory test for three year survival, using the time of the day, day of the week, and ordering frequency of the test, compared to the value of the test result.

Results The presence of a laboratory test order, regardless of any other information about the test result, has a significant association (P{\textless}0.001) with the odds of survival in 233 of 272 (86\%) tests. Data about the timing of when laboratory tests were ordered were more accurate than the test results in predicting survival in 118 of 174 tests (68\%).

Conclusions Healthcare processes must be addressed and accounted for in analysis of observational health data. Without careful consideration to context, {EHR} data are unsuitable for many research questions. However, if explicitly modeled, the same processes that make {EHR} data complex can be leveraged to gain insight into patients’ state of health.},

	abstract = {Background: Many investigators write as if non-differential exposure misclassification inevitably leads to a reduction in the strength of an estimated exposure-disease association. Unfortunately, non-differentiality alone is insufficient to guarantee bias towards the null. Furthermore, because bias refers to the average estimate across study repetitions rather than the result of a single study, bias towards the null is insufficient to guarantee that an observed estimate will be an underestimate. Thus, as noted before, exposure misclassification can spuriously increase the observed strength of an association even when the misclassification process is non-differential and the bias it produced is towards the null. Methods: We present additional results on this topic, including a simulation study of how often an observed relative risk is an overestimate of the true relative risk when the bias is towards the null. Results: The frequency of overestimation depends on many factors: the value of the true relative risk, exposure prevalence, baseline (unexposed) risk, misclassification rates, and other factors that influence bias and random error. Conclusions: Non-differentiality of exposure misclassification does not justify claims that the observed estimate must be an underestimate; further conditions must hold to get bias towards the null, and even when they do hold the observed estimate may by chance be an overestimate. © The Author 2005; all rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Pharmacy commercial claims databases are widely used for pharmacoepidemiologic research. However, concerns have been raised that these databases may not fully capture claims for generic medications as a result of patients filling outside the context of their insurance. This has implications for many research activities and quality improvement programs. We sought to estimate the percentage of missing prescriptions in {US} commercial claims data using a novel design. Methods: Using a large {US} commercial insurance database, we examined the completeness of warfarin prescription claims among patients with atrial fibrillation receiving regular medical follow-up and testing to manage warfarin dosing. We examined 14 different 6-month cross sections. Each cross section was treated independently to identify patients with at least two outpatient diagnoses of atrial fibrillation, two international normalized ratio tests, and one pharmacy claim. Trends in the percentage of patients with prescription claims for generic and branded warfarin were compared by year and 6-month periods using chi-square tests and generalized linear models adjusting for patient characteristics. Results: Out of 111170 patients, the percentage of patients with any warfarin drug decreased slightly from 91.7\% (95\% {CI}: 91.0, 92.4) in early 2003 to 87.1\% (95\% {CI}: 86.7-87.6) in late 2009 (χ2=93.8, p{\textless}0.0001). Over the same interval, the proportion of patients with generic warfarin exposure appearing increased significantly, whereas the proportion of patients with branded warfarin exposure decreased significantly. Conclusions: Our study supports the possibility that some prescriptions may not be captured in {US} commercial insurance databases. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this paper, we provide an analytic proof of the result in the absence of a qualitative interaction between treatment and confounder, and we demonstrate via counterexample that the result need not hold when there is such a qualitative interaction.

	abstract = {Background: Epidemiologic studies of prescription medications increasingly rely on large administrative health care databases. These data do not capture patients' use of medication samples. This could potentially bias studies of short-term effects where date of initiation may be inaccurate. Objectives: To assess the extent of sample use among patients initiating statin therapy. Research Design: Retrospective cohort of patients who filled a first prescription for a statin after at least 6 months of statin-free period in 2007-2010. Low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}) values obtained within the 15 days preceding the first prescription were analyzed using a 2-component Gaussian mixture model to look for evidence of prior treatment. Subjects: A total of 26,033 statin initiators with at least 1 {LDL} laboratory result within the 15 days preceding the prescription fill. Measures: Estimators for the proportion of patients filling a new prescription already on treatment. Results: Among 9256 patients filling a branded statin, {LDL} distribution was bimodal, consisting of 2 Gaussian distributions: one, which made up 13.4\% of the total population, had much lower {LDL} values (mean=71.8 mg/{dL}) compared with the second (mean=148.0 mg/{dL}), suggesting drug use before first dispensed prescription. Among 16,777 patients filling a generic statin, {LDL} levels were substantially higher with no evidence of bimodality that would suggest prior sample use. Conclusions: These results provide indirect evidence that the initial period of branded medication use may often be missed when using pharmacy claims data to define drug initiation. Further research is needed to examine approaches to better identify incident medication use when assessing short-term effects. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

In this review, we discuss past and present wisdom on misclassification and what measures should be taken to quantify this influential bias, with a focus on bias in pharmacoepidemiologic studies. To date, pharmacoepidemiology primarily uses data obtained from administrative claims, a rich source of prescription data, but susceptible to bias from unobservable factors including medication sample use, medications filled but not taken, health conditions that are not reported in the administrative billing data, and inadequate capture of confounders. Because of the increasing focus on comparative effectiveness research, we provide a discussion of misclassification in the context of an active comparator, including a demonstration of treatment effects biased away from the null in the presence of nondifferential misclassification. Finally, we highlight recently developed methods to quantify bias and offer these methods as potential options for strengthening the validity and quantifying uncertainty of results obtained from pharmacoepidemiologic research.},

The model allowed for trends over time to be non-linear and to vary by age.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The number of people aged 30–79 years with hypertension doubled from 1990 to 2019, from 331 (95\% credible interval 306–359) million women and 317 (292–344) million men in 1990 to 626 (584–668) million women and 652 (604–698) million men in 2019, despite stable global age-standardised prevalence. In 2019, age-standardised hypertension prevalence was lowest in Canada and Peru for both men and women; in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and some countries in western Europe including Switzerland, Spain, and the {UK} for women; and in several low-income and middle-income countries such as Eritrea, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Solomon Islands for men. Hypertension prevalence surpassed 50\% for women in two countries and men in nine countries, in central and eastern Europe, central Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. Globally, 59\% (55–62) of women and 49\% (46–52) of men with hypertension reported a previous diagnosis of hypertension in 2019, and 47\% (43–51) of women and 38\% (35–41) of men were treated. Control rates among people with hypertension in 2019 were 23\% (20–27) for women and 18\% (16–21) for men. In 2019, treatment and control rates were highest in South Korea, Canada, and Iceland (treatment {\textgreater}70\%; control {\textgreater}50\%), followed by the {USA}, Costa Rica, Germany, Portugal, and Taiwan. Treatment rates were less than 25\% for women and less than 20\% for men in Nepal, Indonesia, and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Control rates were below 10\% for women and men in these countries and for men in some countries in north Africa, central and south Asia, and eastern Europe. Treatment and control rates have improved in most countries since 1990, but we found little change in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Improvements were largest in high-income countries, central Europe, and some upper-middle-income and recently high-income countries including Costa Rica, Taiwan, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, and Iran.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Improvements in the detection, treatment, and control of hypertension have varied substantially across countries, with some middle-income countries now outperforming most high-income nations. The dual approach of reducing hypertension prevalence through primary prevention and enhancing its treatment and control is achievable not only in high-income countries but also in low-income and middle-income settings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{WHO}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {© 2014 John Wiley  \&  Sons Ltd. What is known and objective Fibromyalgia is a painful disease affecting 1-2\% of the United States population. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ({SNRIs}), such as duloxetine and milnacipran, are well studied and frequently used for treating this disorder. However, efficacy data are limited for the {SNRI} venlafaxine despite its use in nearly a quarter of patients with fibromyalgia. Accordingly, we systematically reviewed the efficacy of venlafaxine for treatment of fibromyalgia. Methods {PubMed}, Web of Science and the Cochrane Database were searched using the terms 'venlafaxine' and 'fibromyalgia'. Results were classified as primary studies or review articles based on abstract review. References of review articles were evaluated to ensure no primary studies evaluating venlafaxine were overlooked. All clinical studies that investigated venlafaxine for the treatment of fibromyalgia were included and graded on strength of evidence. Results and discussion Five studies met the inclusion criteria, including 4 open-label cohort studies and 1 randomized, controlled trial. Study durations ranged from 6 weeks to 6 months, and study sizes ranged from 11 to 102 participants. Four of the five published studies reported improvement in at least one outcome. Generally consistent improvements were observed in pain-related outcome measures, including the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (range, 26-29\% reduction; n = 2 studies), Visual Analog Scale (range, 36-45\% reduction; n = 2 studies), {McGill} Pain Questionnaire (48\% reduction; n = 1 study) and Clinical Global Impression scale (51\% had significant score change; n = 1 study). However, the few studies identified were limited by small sample size, inconsistent use of outcomes and methodological concerns. What is new and conclusion Studies assessing the efficacy of venlafaxine in the treatment of fibromyalgia to date have been limited by small sample size, inconsistent venlafaxine dosing, lack of placebo control and lack of blinding. In the context of these limitations, venlafaxine appears to be at least modestly effective in treating fibromyalgia. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate the full benefit of venlafaxine.},

In addition, {US} government Web sites, including clinicaltrials.gov and fda.gov, were reviewed for pertinent information. Lastly, reference citations from publications identified in the initial search were reviewed. {STUDY} {SELECTION} {AND} {DATA} {EXTRACTION}: All English-language articles identified from the data sources were evaluated. For the evaluation of clinical efficacy and safety, only Phase 2 and 3 studies are included in this review. {DATA} {SYNTHESIS}: In 6 published Phase 3 trials to date, dabigatran has exhibited a similar efficacy and safety profile to that of comparator drugs, including doseadjusted warfarin and enoxaparin, at various dosages. In the largest of these trials, {RE}-{LY} (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy), dabigatran was at least as effective as dose-adjusted warfarin in reducing stroke or systemic embolism. Overall bleeding risks were similar; however, dabigatran may be associated with a lower incidence of intracranial bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke but a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Although dabigatran is not approved for venous thromboembolism ({VTE}) prevention or treatment, results of the {RE}-{MODEL} and {RE}-{NOVATE} trials suggest similar efficacy to once-daily dosing of enoxaparin 40 mg but inferior efficacy to the {FDAapproved} twice-daily dosing of enoxaparin 30 mg in the {RE}-{MOBILIZE} trial. {CONCLUSIONS}: Dabigatran is an effective and safe alternative to oral vitamin K antagonists for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with fewer drug interactions and monitoring requirements. Additionally, dabigatran may be a viable alternative to enoxaparin in {VTE} prevention and warfarin in {VTE} treatment, although current trial data are limited.},

Observational studies on {HBPM}, published after 1992, as identified by {PubMed}, {EMBASE}, and Cochrane literature searches were reviewed. Studies were selected if they met the following criteria: 1) self-measurements had been performed with validated devices; 2) measurement procedures were described in sufficient detail; and 3) papers clearly explained how final {HBPM} results were calculated upon which conclusions and/or treatment decisions were based. Office blood pressure measurement ({OBPM}) yields higher blood pressure values than {HBPM}. For systolic blood pressure, differences between {OBPM} and {HBPM} increase with age and the height of office pressure. Differences also tend to be greater in men than in women and greater in patients without than in those with antihypertensive treatment. Furthermore, {HBPM} can diagnose normotension with almost absolute certainty; it correlates better with target organ damage and cardiovascular mortality than {OBPM}, it enables prediction of sustained hypertension in patients with borderline hypertension, and it proves to be an appropriate tool for assessing drug efficacy.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In a meta-analysis published in October 2001, we reported that new and old classes of antihypertensive drugs had similar long-term efficacy and safety. Furthermore, we observed that in clinical trials in hypertensive or high-risk patients gradients in systolic pressure accounted for most differences in outcome. {OBJECTIVE}: To test whether our previous conclusions would hold, we updated our quantitative overview with new information from 14 clinical trials presented before 1 March 2003. {METHODS}: To compare new and old antihypertensive drugs, we computed pooled odds ratios from stratified 2 x 2 contingency tables. If Zelen's test of heterogeneity was significant, we used a random effects model. In a meta-regression analysis, we correlated odds ratios with corresponding between-group differences in systolic pressure. We then contrasted observed odds ratios with those predicted from gradients in systolic pressure. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES}: Differences in achieved systolic blood pressure and incidence of total and cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure. {NEW} {VERSUS} {OLD} {DRUGS}: In 15 trials, 120 574 hypertensive patients were randomized to old drugs (diuretics or beta-blockers) or new agents [calcium-channel blockers, alpha-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors or angiotensin type-1 receptor ({AR}1) blockers]. Old and new drugs provided similar protection against total and cardiovascular mortality and fatal plus non-fatal myocardial infarction. Calcium-channel blockers, including (-8\%, P = 0.07) or excluding verapamil (-10\%, P = 0.02), as well as {AR}1 blockers (-24\%, P = 0.0002) resulted in better stroke prevention than did the old drugs, whereas the opposite trend was observed for {ACE} inhibitors (+10\%, P = 0.03). The risk of heart failure was higher (P {\textless} 0.0001) on calcium-channel blockers (+33\%) and alpha-blockers (+102\%) than on conventional therapy involving diuretics. {META}-{REGRESSION}: Between-group differences in achieved systolic pressure ranged from 0.1 to 3.2 {mmHg} in seven actively controlled trials (73 237 patients), and from 2.1 to 22.1 {mmHg} in seven studies comparing varying intensities of blood pressure lowering (11 128 patients). For these 14 new trials, we predicted outcome from achieved systolic blood pressure using our previously published meta-regression models based on 30 trials with 149 407 patients. In general, predicted and observed odds ratios were similar. Larger reductions in systolic pressure (weighted mean 1.8 {mmHg}) in two trials accounted for the advantage of {AR}1 blockers over conventional therapy in the prevention of stroke. Only for cardiovascular mortality in very old patients (P = 0.02) and for cardiovascular events and myocardial infarction in old Australians (P {\textless} 0.05), the observed odds ratios deviated from our predictions based on the gradients in systolic blood pressure. {INTERPRETATION}: The hypothesis that new antihypertensive drugs, such as calcium-channel blockers, alpha-blockers, {ACE} inhibitors or {AR}1 blockers might influence cardiovascular prognosis over and beyond their antihypertensive effects remains unproven. The finding that blood pressure differences largely accounted for cardiovascular outcome emphasizes the desirability of tight blood pressure control. However, the level to which blood pressure must be lowered to achieve maximal benefit remains currently unknown.},

	abstract = {Patients with resistant hypertension ({RH}) are at greater risk for stroke, renal insufficiency, and cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) events than are those for whom blood pressure ({BP}) is responsive to and well controlled by therapeutic interventions. Although all chronotherapy trials have compared the effects on {BP} regulation of full daily doses of medications when ingested in the morning versus at bedtime, prescription of the same medications in divided doses twice daily ({BID}) is frequent. Here, we investigated the influence of hypertension treatment-time regimen on the circadian {BP} pattern, degree of {BP} control, and relevant clinical and laboratory medicine parameters of {RH} patients evaluated by 48-h ambulatory {BP} monitoring ({ABPM}). This cross-sectional study evaluated 2899 such patients (1701 men/1198 women), 64.2 ± 11.8 (mean ± {SD}) yrs of age, enrolled in the Hygia Project. Among the participants, 1084 were ingesting all hypertension medications upon awakening (upon-awakening regimen), 1436 patients were ingesting the full daily dose of ≥1 of them at bedtime (bedtime regimen), and 379 were ingesting split doses of ≥1 medications {BID} upon awakening and at bedtime ({BID} regimen). Patients of the bedtime regimen compared with the other two treatment-time regimens had lower likelihood of microalbuminuria and chronic kidney disease; significantly lower albumin/creatinine ratio, glucose, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}) cholesterol; plus higher estimated glomerular filtration rate and high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}) cholesterol. The bedtime regimen was also significantly associated with lower asleep systolic ({SBP}) and diastolic ({DBP}) {BP} means than the upon-awakening and {BID} regimens. The sleep-time relative {SBP} and {DBP} decline was significantly attenuated by the upon-awakening and {BID} regimens (p {\textless} .001), resulting in significantly higher prevalence of non-dipping in these two treatment-time regimen groups (80.5\% and 77.3\%, respectively) than in the bedtime regimen (54.4\%; p {\textless} .001 between groups). Additionally, the prevalence of the riser {BP} pattern, associated with highest {CVD} risk, was much greater, 31.0\% and 29.8\%, respectively, among patients of the upon-awakening and {BID}-treatment regimens, compared with the bedtime regimen (17.6\%; p {\textless} .001 between groups). Patients of the bedtime regimen also showed significantly higher prevalence of properly controlled ambulatory {BP} (p {\textless} .001) as a result of a greater proportion of them showing complete control of asleep {SBP} and {DBP} means. Our findings demonstrate significantly lower asleep {SBP} and {DBP} means and attenuated prevalence of blunted nighttime {BP} decline, i.e., lower prevalence of {CVD} risk markers, in {RH} patients ingesting the full daily dose of ≥1 hypertension medications at bedtime than in those ingesting all of them upon awakening or ≥1 of them as split doses {BID}. In {RH}, ingesting the same medications {BID} neither improves ambulatory {BP} control nor reduces the prevalence of non-dipping, and cannot be considered chronotherapy. Collectively, findings of this study indicate that a bedtime hypertension medication regimen, in conjunction with proper patient evaluation by {ABPM} to corroborate the diagnosis of true {RH} and avoid treatment-induced nocturnal hypotension, should be the therapeutic scheme of choice for patients who, by conventional cuff methods (and in the absence of {ABPM}) and the morning-treatment regimen, have been mistakenly judged to be resistant to therapy.

	abstract = {Randomized trials of hypertension have seldom examined heterogeneity in response to treatments over time and the implications for cardiovascular outcomes. Understanding this heterogeneity, however, is a necessary step toward personalizing antihypertensive therapy. We applied trajectory-based modeling to data on 39 763 study participants of the {ALLHAT} (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) to identify distinct patterns of systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) response to randomized medications during the first 6 months of the trial. Two trajectory patterns were identified: immediate responders (85.5\%), on average, had a decreasing {SBP}, whereas nonimmediate responders (14.5\%), on average, had an initially increasing {SBP} followed by a decrease. Compared with those randomized to chlorthalidone, participants randomized to amlodipine (odds ratio, 1.20; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.10-1.31), lisinopril (odds ratio, 1.88; 95\% {CI}, 1.73-2.03), and doxazosin (odds ratio, 1.65; 95\% {CI}, 1.52-1.78) had higher adjusted odds ratios associated with being a nonimmediate responder (versus immediate responder). After multivariable adjustment, nonimmediate responders had a higher hazard ratio of stroke (hazard ratio, 1.49; 95\% {CI}, 1.21-1.84), combined cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95\% {CI}, 1.11-1.31), and heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.48; 95\% {CI}, 1.24-1.78) during follow-up between 6 months and 2 years. The {SBP} response trajectories provided superior discrimination for predicting downstream adverse cardiovascular events than classification based on difference in {SBP} between the first 2 measurements, {SBP} at 6 months, and average {SBP} during the first 6 months. Our findings demonstrate heterogeneity in response to antihypertensive therapies and show that chlorthalidone is associated with more favorable initial response than the other medications.},

An angiographic severity score was prospectively developed, assigning points for any stenosis weighted by stenosis severity, location, and collaterals and was then tested for prediction for adverse outcome in 917 women, over a median of 9.3 years. {SETTING}: The study was conducted in referral centers. {PATIENTS}: Women with signs and/or symptoms of myocardial ischemia referred for coronary angiography were consecutively consented and enrolled in a prospective study. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Main outcomes included first occurrence of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Hospitalization for angina was a secondary outcome. {RESULTS}: Cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction at 10 years occurred in 6.7\%, 12.8\%, and 25.9\% of women with no, nonobstructive, and obstructive {CAD} (P {\textless} .0001), respectively. Cumulative 10-year cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction rates showed progressive, near-linear increases for each {WISE} {CAD} severity score range of 5, 5.1 to 10, 10.1 to 20, 20.1 to 50, and {\textgreater}50. The optimal threshold in the {WISE} severity score classifications for predicting cardiovascular mortality was {\textgreater}10 (eg, 5.0-10 vs 10.1-89), with both a sensitivity and specificity of 0.64 and an area under the curve of 0.64 (P = .02, 95\% {CI} 0.59-0.68). {CONCLUSIONS}: Among women with signs and symptoms of ischemia, nonobstructive {CAD} is common and associated with adverse outcomes over the longer term. The new {WISE} angiographic score appears to be useful for risk prediction in this population.},

We evaluate the robustness of prediction accuracy summaries, obtained from receiver operating characteristic curves and risk-reclassification methods, if events are not captured (i.e., "false negatives"). We derive estimators for sensitivity and specificity if misclassification is independent of marker values. In simulation studies, we quantify the potential for bias in prediction accuracy summaries if misclassification depends on marker values. We compare the accuracy of alternative prognostic models for 30-day all-cause hospital readmission among 4548 patients discharged from the University of Pennsylvania Health System with a primary diagnosis of heart failure. Simulation studies indicate that if misclassification depends on marker values, then the estimated accuracy improvement is also biased, but the direction of the bias depends on the direction of the association between markers and the probability of misclassification. In our application, 29\% of the 1143 readmitted patients were readmitted to a hospital elsewhere in Pennsylvania, which reduced prediction accuracy. Outcome misclassification can result in erroneous conclusions regarding the accuracy of risk-prediction models.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The characteristics of and trends in pharmacy practice in ambulatory care settings across the United States were studied. {METHODS}: A 2004 national survey of the ambulatory care responsibilities of pharmacists across a spectrum of organizational types (community hospitals, county facilities, Indian Health Services facilities, Veterans Affairs ({VA}) facilities, teaching institutions, integrated health networks, military facilities, and health maintenance organizations) was conducted and related to organizational features that could promote pharmacist participation. {RESULTS}: From 1672 deliverable Web-based surveys, 233 organizations reported at least some pharmacist involvement in ambulatory activities, while 475 reported none. Over half of the 228 organizations with some pharmacist involvement reported pharmacists tracking adverse drug reactions (67\%), providing written (53\%) or oral (52\%) information with new prescriptions, and conducting medication management programs (51\%). Some 85\% reported having at least one clinic with pharmacist involvement. Clinics for anticoagulation services (36\%) and oncology services (28\%) were most prevalent, followed by primary care or family practice clinics (23\%) and diabetes clinics (21\%). New survey items found a high prevalence of pharmacist involvement in emergency preparedness programs (90\%), medication management services in complex medication situations (63\%), and using evidence-based practice guidelines (60\%). Of nine enabling factors (factors potentially promoting pharmacist involvement) investigated, participation on multidisciplinary teams and having collaborative practice agreements were significantly associated with pharmacist participation in at least one ambulatory care activity. Having at last one ambulatory care staff pharmacist with advanced training, having at least one residency program, and having collaborative practice agreements were significantly associated with pharmacist participation in at least one clinic or program. Pharmacist participation in ambulatory care activities was not equally distributed across different types of organizations, and {VA} facilities were notable for the amount and extent of participation. {CONCLUSION}: Pharmacists' roles and responsibilities in ambulatory care appear to continue to evolve, with {VA} facilities leading the way.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Hypertension is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, whereas low systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) is a powerful adverse prognosticator in acute coronary syndrome. However, it is unclear whether the prognostic significance of low {SBP} differs in patients with versus without prior history of hypertension. We sought to investigate the relationships between presenting {SBP}, prior hypertension, antihypertensive medication use, and outcomes in non-{ST}-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome ({NSTEACS}). {METHODS}: Using data from {GRACE}/{GRACE}(2) and {CANRACE}, we stratified 10,337 patients with {NSTEACS} from 1999 to 2008 into 2 groups: those with and those without prior diagnosis of hypertension. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the prognostic significance of prior hypertension on in-hospital mortality and tested for the interactions between prior hypertension, antihypertensive medication use, and presenting {SBP}. {RESULTS}: Compared with patients without prior hypertension (n = 3,732), those with prior hypertension (n = 6,605) were older; more likely to be female; and more frequently had diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, renal insufficiency, and higher Killip class and {GRACE} risk scores on presentation. Patients with prior hypertension were more likely to be on antihypertensive medications before admission, to present with higher {SBP}, and to have heart failure or cardiogenic shock in hospital (6.0\% vs 10.1\%; P {\textless} .001). In-hospital mortality was higher among patients presenting with lower {SBP} but did not differ between the groups with and without prior hypertension. In multivariable analysis, neither prior hypertension (adjusted odds ratio = 1.15, 95\% {CI} 0.78-1.70, P = .48) nor the number of antihypertensive medications used (P for trend = .84) was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. In contrast, {SBP} was a strong independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 1.21 per 10 mm Hg lower, 1.15-1.27, P {\textless} .001). There was no significant interaction between {SBP} and prior hypertension (P for interaction = .62) or pre-admission antihypertensive medication use (P for interaction = .46) with respect to in-hospital mortality. {CONCLUSION}: Low {SBP} on presentation, but not prior hypertension, was independently associated with in-hospital mortality in {NSTEACS}. The powerful prognostic value of {SBP} is similar regardless of a history of hypertension or pre-admission antihypertensive medication use.},

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 and updated in 2005. {OBJECTIVES}: This systematic review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of blood pressure lowering agents in people with diabetes mellitus and a normal amount of albumin in the urine (normoalbuminuria). {SEARCH} {METHODS}: In January 2011 we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator. {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: Randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}) comparing any antihypertensive agent with placebo or another agent in hypertensive or normotensive patients with diabetes and no kidney disease (albumin excretion rate {\textless} 30 mg/d) were included. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two investigators independently extracted data on kidney and other patient-relevant outcomes (all-cause mortality and serious cardiovascular events), and assessed study quality. Analysis was by a random effects model was applied to analyse results which were expressed as risk ratio ({RR}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}). {MAIN} {RESULTS}: We identified 26 studies that enrolling 61,264 participants. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ({ACEi}) reduced the risk of new onset of microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria or both when compared to placebo (8 studies, 11,906 patients: {RR} 0.71, 95\% {CI} 0.56 to 0.89), with similar benefits in people with and without hypertension (P = 0.74), and when compared to calcium channel blockers (5 studies, 1253 participants: {RR} 0.60, 95\% {CI} 0.42 to 0.85). {ACEi} reduced the risk of death when compared to placebo (6 studies, 11,350 participants: {RR} 0.84, 95\% {CI} 0.73 to 0.97). No effect was observed for angiotensin receptor blockers ({ARB}) when compared to placebo for new microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria or both (5 studies, 7653 participants: {RR} 0.90, 95\% {CI} 0.68 to 1.19) or death (5 studies, 7653 participants: {RR} 1.12, 95\% {CI} 0.88 to 1.41); however, meta-regression suggested possible benefits from {ARB} for preventing kidney disease in high risk patients. There was a trend towards benefit from use of combined {ACEi} and {ARB} for prevention of {DKD} compared with {ACEi} alone (2 studies, 4171 participants: {RR} 0.88, 95\% {CI} 0.78 to 1.00).The risk of cough was significantly increased with {ACEi} when compared to placebo (6 studies, 11,791 patients: {RR} 1.84, 95\% {CI} 1.24 to 2.72), however there was no significant difference in the risk of headache or hyperkalaemia. There was no significant difference in the risk of cough, headache or hyperkalaemia when {ARB} was to placebo. On average risk of bias was judged to be either low (27\% to 69\%) or unclear (i.e. no information available) (8\% to 73\%). Blinding of participants, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting were judged to be high in 23\%, 31\% and 31\% of studies, respectively. {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: {ACEi} were found to prevent new onset {DKD} and death in normoalbuminuric people with diabetes, and could therefore be used in this population. More data are needed to clarify the role of {ARB} and other drug classes in preventing {DKD}.},

While specifically comparing patients with {CRH} and uncontrolled resistant hypertension ({UCRH}), we hoped to identify distinguishing characteristics that would provide insight into factors contributing to resistance to antihypertensive therapies. {RHTN} patients were identified as controlled ({CRH}, n=43) or uncontrolled ({UCRH}, n=47). No statistical differences were observed between the {CRH} and {UCRH} subgroups with respect to age and gender. The body mass index, aldosterone-renin ratio and pulse wave velocity ({PWV}) were significantly higher in {UCRH} patients. Although both subgroups showed increased cardiac mass, left ventricular mass index was significantly higher in {UCRH} compared with {CRH} patients. Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that {PWV} was significantly dependent on age in both {UCRH} and {CRH} patients; however, the influence of ageing was more pronounced in the former subgroup. Older age, greater vascular stiffness, higher aldosterone levels and greater left ventricular hypertrophy were significantly associated with lack of {BP} control in patients with {RHTN}.

The hazard ratio for coronary revascularization was 1.09 (95\% confidence interval, 0.88-1.35) based on {WHI} outcomes and 1.10 (95\% confidence interval, 0.89-1.35) based on Medicare data. The differences between hazard ratios derived from {WHI} and Medicare data were not significant in 1000 bootstrap replications. {CONCLUSIONS}: Medicare claims may provide useful data on coronary heart disease outcomes among patients aged {\textgreater}/=65 years in clinical research studies. {CLINICAL} {TRIALS} {REGISTRATION} {INFORMATION}: {URL}: www.clinicaltrials.gov.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: We have previously shown that in Italian region of Lombardy (about 10 million citizens), adherence to antihypertensive treatment is low, and that this is associated with a greater risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular events. In this study, we used a healthcare database to study the factors involved in discontinuation of antihypertensive drug prescriptions in real life. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: The analysis was restricted to 493 623 new users of antihypertensive drugs (no prescriptions in the previous 3 years) recruited in 2003, 2006 and 2009. Discontinuation was defined as lack of prescription renewal for at least 3 months. Each patient was followed at most for 1 year. The adjusted risk of treatment discontinuation depended on the type of initial antihypertensive treatment (diuretic monotherapy associated with higher risk) and it was lower in men (-17\%) and older (-21 to -29\%) patients, in patients with co-treatment with antidiabetic drugs, or hospitalization for cardiovascular or renal disease (-12 to -27\%), but greater in patients under co-treatment with antidepressant drugs or hospitalization for concomitant pulmonary, rheumatic, neoplastic or neurological diseases (+9 to +32\%). An unexpected relationship between discontinuation of treatment and density of the population of patient's residence, with a much greater discontinuation in metropolitan areas, was observed. {CONCLUSIONS}: In a real life setting, discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment is affected in an opposite direction by a large number of factors: type of antihypertensive treatment, co-treatments, clinical conditions and even demographic characteristics of the geographical area where the patient lives. Knowledge of these factors may help the effort to reduce this phenomenon.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The 3 fluoroquinolone ({FQ}) antibiotics - ciprofoxacin, levofoxacin, and moxifoxacin - are commonly administered to oncology patients. Although these oral antibiotics are approved by the {US} Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) for treatment of urinary tract infections, acute bacterial sinusitis, or bacterial infection in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, they are commonly prescribed off-label to neutropenic cancer patients for the prevention and treatment of infections associated with febrile neutropenia. New serious {FQ}-associated safety concerns have been identified through novel collaborations between {FQ}-treated persons who have developed long-term neuropsychiatric ({NP}) toxicity, pharmacovigilance experts, and basic scientists. {OBJECTIVE}: To conduct basic science and clinical investigations of a newly identified adverse drug reaction, termed {FQ}-associated disability. {METHODS}: 5 groups of C57BL/6 mice receiving the antibiotic ciprofoxacin in 10-mg increments (10 mg/kg-50 mg/kg) and 1 group of control mice were evaluated. The Southern Network on Adverse Reactions ({SONAR}) and a social network of {FQ}-treated persons with long-term {NP} toxicity (the Floxed Network) conducted a web-based survey. The clinical toxicity manifestations reported by 94 respondents to the web-based survey of persons who had received 1 or more doses of an {FQ} prescribed for any indication (generally at {FDA}-approved dosages) and who subsequently experienced possible adverse drug reactions were compared with adverse event information included on the product label for levofoxacin and with {FQ}-associated adverse events reported to the {FDA}'s {MedWatch} program. {RESULTS}: Mice treated with ciprofoxacin had lower grip strengths, reduced balance, and depressive behavior compared with the controls. For the survey, 93 of 94 respondents reported {FQ}-associated events including anxiety, depression, insomnia, panic attacks, clouded thinking, depersonalization, suicidal thoughts, psychosis, nightmares, and impaired memory beginning within days of {FQ} initiation or days to months of {FQ} discontinuation. The {FDA} Adverse Event Reporting System ({FAERS}) included 210,705 adverse events and 2,991 fatalities for {FQs}. Levofoxacin and ciprofoxacin toxicities were neurologic (30\% and 26\%, respectively), tendon damage (8\% and 6\%), and psychiatric (10\% and 2\%). In 2013, an {FDA} safety review reported that {FQs} affect mammalian topoisomerase {II}, especially in mitochondria. In 2013 and 2014, {SONAR} fled citizen petitions requesting black box revisions identifying neuropsychiatric toxicities and mitochrondrial toxicity as serious levofoxacin-associated adverse drug reactions. In 2015, {FDA} advisors recommended that {FQ} product labels be revised to include information about this newly identified disability syndrome termed "{FQ}-associated disability" ({FQAD}). {LIMITATIONS}: Basic science studies evaluated {NP} toxicity for only 1 {FQ}, ciprofoxacin. {CONCLUSION}: Pharmacovigilance investigators, a social network, and basic scientists can collaborate on pharmacovigilance investigations. Revised product labels describing a new serious adverse drug reaction, levofoxacin-associated long-term disability, as recommended by an {FDA} advisory committee, are advised.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: We compared long-term health outcomes associated with beta-adrenergic blocking agents and diltiazem treatment for unstable angina. {BACKGROUND}: No long-term data have been published comparing these two antianginal treatments in this setting. {METHODS}: Eligible veterans were discharged from the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System ({VAPSHCS}), Seattle Division, between October 1989 and September 1995 with an unstable angina diagnosis and were prescribed monotherapy beta-blocker or diltiazem treatment at discharge. Medication data were collected from medical records and computerized {VAPSHCS} outpatient pharmacy files. Follow-up death and coronary artery disease rehospitalization data were collected through 1996. Proportional hazards regression compared survival among diltiazem and beta-blocker users, controlling for patient characteristics with propensity scores. {RESULTS}: Two hundred forty-seven veterans (24\% on beta-blockers, 76\% on diltiazem) were included in this study. There were 54 (22\%) deaths during an average follow-up of 51 months. After propensity score adjustment, there was no difference in risk of death comparing diltiazem to beta-blocker treatment (hazards ratios [{HR}] 1.1; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.49 to 2.4). Among Washington residents (n=207), there were 146 (71\%) coronary artery disease rehospitalizations or deaths during follow-up. After adjustment, there was a nonsignificant increase in risk of rehospitalization or death associated with diltiazem use ({HR} 1.4; 95\% {CI} 0.80 to 2.4). For both analyses, similar risks were found among veterans without relative contraindications to beta-blockers. {CONCLUSIONS}: We found no survival benefit of diltiazem over beta-blocker treatment for unstable angina in this cohort of veterans.},

A literature search was performed with {MEDLINE}, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, {PsychLIT}, {ERIC}, and {EMBASE} for the period from 1966 to December 2000. Only randomized, controlled trials with at least 10 subjects per intervention group were included. Of 484 articles evaluated, only 61 met the criteria for the meta-analysis. Multiple interventions or study samples were identified in 23 of the articles. Each intervention was counted as a separate study, yielding 95 cohorts totaling 18,922 subjects. Of these subjects, 9,604 (51\%) received interventions and 9,318 served as controls. Cohorts reported between 1990 and 1999 accounted for 53\% of the sample; 56\% of all cohorts were based in physician offices and 26\% involved hypertensive patients. Behavioral interventions accounted for 41 cohorts (8,885 subjects), educational interventions for 22 cohorts (6,392 subjects), and combined interventions for 32 cohorts (3,645 subjects). Homogeneity of groupings and effect sizes ({ESs}) were calculated for each type of intervention. Overall, the data were not homogeneous, so conclusions could not be derived from the entire body of data. The educational intervention and combined intervention cohorts were nonhomogeneous (p {\textless} 0.001 and p {\textless} 0.01, respectively); however, the behavioral intervention cohort was homogeneous (Q = 42.48, d.f. = 40, p = 0.36). The overall {ES} for behavioral interventions was 0.07 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 0.04-0.09). There were no significant differences among the behavioral interventions. Educational interventions had an overall {ES} of 0.11 (95\% {CI} = 0.06-0.15); there were no significant differences among the educational interventions. The overall {ES} of the combined interventions was 0.08 (95\% {CI} = 0.04-0.12). When stratifying the combined intervention group by type of behavioral intervention, mail reminders had the largest impact ({ES} = 0.38).

The current study estimated the national cost of {CMRFCs} independent of the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S., as well as the cost for all major payers and the marginal cost per individual using a Heckman selection model with Smearing retransformation. {CMRFCs} included {BMI} {\textgreater}or= 25 and two of the following three: diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and/or hypertension. All amounts are expressed in 2005 U.S. dollars. {RESULTS}: National medical expenditures attributable to {CMRFCs} in the U.S. totaled 80 billion dollars, of which 27 billion dollars was spent on prescription drugs. Private insurance paid the largest amount of the national bill (28 billion dollars), followed by Medicare (11 billion dollars), Medicaid (6 billion dollars), and the Veterans Administration (4 billion dollars), whereas individuals paid 28 billion dollars out-of-pocket. For each individual with {CMRFCs}, 5477 dollars in medical expenditures was attributable to {CMRFCs}, of which 1832 dollars was for prescription drugs. On average, individuals with {CMRFCs} spent 1668 dollars out-of-pocket, of which 830 dollars was for prescription drugs. {DISCUSSION}: The results of this study show that {CMRFCs} result in significant medical cost in the U.S. independent of the cost of cardiovascular disease.

Hence, the objectives of this work were to systematically review and critically appraise the literature and to conduct a meta-analysis on the prevalence of {RH} in treated hypertensive populations. {METHODS}: {PubMed}, Cochrane Library, {CRD} York databases, and study bibliographies were systematically searched for observational and interventional studies that report disease frequency in adult populations. The pooled prevalence was obtained through random-effect modeling. Furthermore, quality assessment, publication bias diagnostics, meta-regression, subgroup analysis by sex, and sensitivity analysis were performed. {RESULTS}: Out of 318 retrieved studies, 20 observational studies and 4 randomized control trials ({RCTs}) with a total population of 961,035 were included. The random-effect method for observational studies and {RCTs} yielded {RH} prevalence ratios of 13.72\% (95\% confidence interval ({CI}) = 11.19\%-16.24\%) and 16.32\% (95\% {CI} = 10.68\%-21.95\%), respectively. Yet, most studies were incapable of ruling out pseudo-resistance caused by white-coat effect, poor medication adherence, and suboptimal dosing. Differences in {RH} prevalence by sex were negligible. Meta-regression analysis showed that study-level characteristics had no statistically significant influence on {RH} prevalence. The inclusion of further studies in the sensitivity analysis concurred with the baseline results (13.19\%; 95\% {CI} = 10.89\%-15.49\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: Researchers should enhance comparability of future empirical evidence through homogeneous methodologies and comparable baseline populations. This meta-analysis concludes that {RH} is a frequent phenomenon and further harmonization in terms of {RH} definition and measurement would be necessary to clearly distinguish true treatment resistance from pseudo-resistance.},

Four hundred participants with a diastolic {BP} ({DBP}) of 95 mm Hg or more as measured at physicians' offices were enrolled and followed up for 1 year. {INTERVENTIONS}: Antihypertensive drug treatment was adjusted in a stepwise fashion based on either the self-measured {DBP} at home (average of 6 measurements per day during 1 week; n = 203) or the average of 3 sitting {DBP} readings at the physician's office (n = 197). If the {DBP} guiding treatment was above ({\textgreater}89 mm Hg), at (80-89 mm Hg), or below ({\textless}80 mm Hg) target, a physician blinded to randomization intensified antihypertensive treatment, left it unchanged, or reduced it, respectively. {MEAN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Office and home {BP} levels, 24-hour ambulatory {BP}, intensity of drug treatment, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic left ventricular mass, symptoms reported by questionnaire, and costs of treatment. {RESULTS}: At the end of the study (median follow-up, 350 days; interquartile range, 326-409 days), more home {BP} than office {BP} patients had stopped antihypertensive drug treatment (25.6\% vs 11.3\%; P{\textless}.001) with no significant difference in the proportions of patients progressing to multiple-drug treatment (38.7\% vs 45.1\%; P =.14). The final office, home, and 24-hour ambulatory {BP} measurements were higher (P{\textless}.001) in the home {BP} group than in the office {BP} group. The mean baseline-adjusted systolic/diastolic differences between the home and office {BP} groups averaged 6.8/3.5 mm Hg, 4.9/2.9 mm Hg, and 4.9/2.9 mm Hg, respectively. Left ventricular mass and reported symptoms were similar in the 2 groups. Costs per 100 patients followed up for 1 month were only slightly lower in the home {BP} group (3875 vs 3522 [4921 dollars vs 4473 dollars]; P =.04). {CONCLUSIONS}: Adjustment of antihypertensive treatment based on home {BP} instead of office {BP} led to less intensive drug treatment and marginally lower costs but also to less {BP} control, with no differences in general well-being or left ventricular mass. Self-measurement allowed identification of patients with white-coat hypertension. Our findings support a stepwise strategy for the evaluation of {BP} in which self-measurement and ambulatory monitoring are complementary to conventional office measurement and highlight the need for prospective outcome studies to establish the normal range of home-measured {BP}.},

Yet, despite several relevant studies and years of clinical experience, the mechanism and optimal treatment of diuretic-induced hyponatremia remain unclear. What is clear is that most cases are caused by thiazide rather than loop diuretics and that severe hyponatremia can develop very rapidly in susceptible patients. In this review, I will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, prevention, and treatment of diuretic-induced hyponatremia in the hope that increased awareness and understanding will reduce the incidence and complications of this potentially life-threatening syndrome.},

One study has reported an increased incidence of {ACE} inhibitor-associated angioedema among transplant patients compared to published rates, while several case series report angioedema in patients taking specific immunosuppressant agents. {OBJECTIVE}: To test the hypothesis that transplant patients are at increased risk of {ACE} inhibitor-associated angioedema. {METHODS}: We assessed the proportion of transplant patients in 145 cases with {ACE} inhibitor-associated angioedema and 280 {ACE} inhibitor-exposed controls. We measured the relationship between case-control status, transplant status, and immunosuppressant use and circulating {DPPIV} activity. We also assessed the incidence of angioedema among consecutive patients who underwent renal or cardiac transplant and were treated with an {ACE} inhibitor. {RESULTS}: Transplant patients were significantly overrepresented among {ACE} inhibitor-associated angioedema cases compared to controls (odds ratio 18.5, 95\% {CI} 2.3-147.2, P = 0.0004). Immunosuppressant use, chronic renal failure, seasonal allergies and smoking were also associated with {ACE} inhibitor-associated angioedema in univariate analysis. The association of transplant status with {ACE} inhibitor-associated angioedema was no longer significant after inclusion of immunosuppressant therapy in a multivariate analysis. Dipeptidyl peptidase {IV} activity was significantly decreased in sera from cases compared to {ACE} inhibitor-exposed controls, as well as in individuals taking immunosuppressants. Two of 47 {ACE} inhibitor-treated renal transplant patients and one of 36 {ACE} inhibitor-treated cardiac transplant patients developed angioedema. {CONCLUSION}: Transplant patients are at increased risk of {ACE} inhibitor-associated angioedema possibly because of the effects of immunosuppressants on the activity of {DPPIV}.},

Different systems have been proposed to manage diabetes care. {OBJECTIVES}: To assess the effects of different interventions, targeted at health professionals or the structure in which they deliver care, on the management of patients with diabetes in primary care, outpatient and community settings. {SEARCH} {STRATEGY}: We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group specialised register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 4 1999), {MEDLINE} (1966-1999), {EMBASE} (1980-1999), Cinahl (1982-1999), and reference lists of articles. {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: Randomised trials ({RCTs}), controlled clinical trials ({CCTs}), controlled before and after studies ({CBAs}) and interrupted time series ({ITS}) analyses of professional, financial and organisational strategies aimed at improving care for people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The participants were health care professionals, including physicians, nurses and pharmacists. The outcomes included objectively measured health professional performance or patient outcomes, and self-report measures with known validity and reliability. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Forty-one studies were included involving more than 200 practices and 48,000 patients. Twenty-seven studies were {RCTs}, 12 were {CBAs}, and two were {ITS}. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of interventions, participants, settings and outcomes. The methodological quality of the studies was often poor. In all studies the intervention strategy was multifaceted. In 12 studies the interventions were targeted at health professionals, in nine they were targeted at the organisation of care, and 20 studies targeted both. In 15 studies patient education was added to the professional and organisational interventions. A combination of professional interventions improved process outcomes. The effect on patient outcomes remained less clear as these were rarely assessed. Arrangements for follow-up (organisational intervention) also showed a favourable effect on process outcomes. Multiple interventions in which patient education was added or in which the role of the nurse was enhanced also reported favourable effects on patients' health outcomes. {REVIEWER}'S {CONCLUSIONS}: Multifaceted professional interventions can enhance the performance of health professionals in managing patients with diabetes. Organisational interventions that improve regular prompted recall and review of patients (central computerised tracking systems or nurses who regularly contact the patient) can also improve diabetes management. The addition of patient-oriented interventions can lead to improved patient health outcomes. Nurses can play an important role in patient-oriented interventions, through patient education or facilitating adherence to treatment.},

Based on the response of the directors, programs were assigned to experimental (programs offering clinical pharmacy services) or control (no clinical pharmacy services) groups. Completed attitudinal instruments were received from 158 resident respondents in the experimental group and 153 resident respondents from the control group. The reliability coefficient of the returned questionnaires was 0.901 by the split-halves method. Residents in the experimental group had significantly more favorable attitudes than those residents in the control group on several scales. These scales included the clinical pharmacist's participation on the health care team, utility of a clinical pharmacist in a private practice setting, desirability of hiring a clinical pharmacist, and the desirability of practicing with a multidisciplinary health care team.

	abstract = {Central aortic systolic blood pressure ({BP}) is an important determinant of cardiac workload and cardiac hypertrophy. The relationship of central aortic systolic {BP} and brachial {BP} varies depending on the stiffness of blood vessels. It is not certain whether the different drug classes affect the brachial and aortic systolic {BP} in a similar manner. In a double-blind crossover study, we measured the effects of the four major drug classes compared with placebo on central aortic pressure. Central aortic pressure and various indices were determined using the Sphygmo Cor apparatus. The study was undertaken in patients aged 65 to 85 years with systolic {BP} {\textgreater}150 mm Hg at study entry. Results are reported for 32 patients who had satisfactory applanation tonometry in all five periods. Calcium channel blockers and diuretics caused a greater fall in brachial artery systolic {BP} than angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors or beta-blocking drugs. On placebo, central aorta augmentation pressure and index were 23 mm Hg and 33.3\%; on {ACE} inhibitors the values were 18 mm Hg and 30\%; on beta-blockers, 26 mm Hg and 38.5\%; on calcium channel blockers, 16 mm Hg and 28\%; and on diuretics, 17 mm Hg and 28.8\%. The augmentation pressure on beta-blocking drugs was greater than on the other three drug classes (P {\textless}.05), and augmentation pressures on {ACE} inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics were less than on placebo (P {\textless}.05). The lowest central aortic pressures were achieved with calcium blocking drugs and diuretics. Therapy based on brachial artery recordings may thus overestimate the effect of beta-blocking drugs on central aortic systolic {BP} and underestimate the effectiveness of {ACE} inhibitors and calcium blocking drugs. The clinical importance of this discrepancy needs to be evaluated.},

We compared the {ACE} inhibitor ramipril, the {ARB} telmisartan, and the combination of the two drugs in patients with vascular disease or high-risk diabetes. {METHODS}: After a 3-week, single-blind run-in period, patients underwent double-blind randomization, with 8576 assigned to receive 10 mg of ramipril per day, 8542 assigned to receive 80 mg of telmisartan per day, and 8502 assigned to receive both drugs (combination therapy). The primary composite outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. {RESULTS}: Mean blood pressure was lower in both the telmisartan group (a 0.9/0.6 mm Hg greater reduction) and the combination-therapy group (a 2.4/1.4 mm Hg greater reduction) than in the ramipril group. At a median follow-up of 56 months, the primary outcome had occurred in 1412 patients in the ramipril group (16.5\%), as compared with 1423 patients in the telmisartan group (16.7\%; relative risk, 1.01; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.94 to 1.09).

The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to primary care physicians' willingness to increase the intensity of treatment among patients with uncontrolled hypertension. {METHODS}: Descriptive survey study. We sampled patient visits in a large midwestern health system to identify patients with uncontrolled hypertension. The treating primary care physicians were asked to complete a survey about the patient visit with a copy of the office notes attached to the survey (patient visits, n = 270; response rate, 86\%). {RESULTS}: Pharmacologic therapy was initiated or changed at only 38\% of visits, despite documented hypertension for at least 6 months before the patients' most recent visit. The most frequently cited reason for no initiation or change in therapy was related to the primary care physicians being satisfied with the blood pressure ({BP}) value (satisfactory {BP} response, 30\%; satisfactory diastolic {BP} response, 16\%; only borderline hypertension, 10\%). At 93\% of these visits, systolic {BP} values were 140 mm Hg or higher, which is above the cut point recommended by Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines, and 35\% were 150 mm Hg or higher. On average, physicians reported that 150 mm Hg was the lowest systolic {BP} at which they would recommend pharmacologic treatment to patients, compared with 91 mm Hg for diastolic {BP}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings suggest that an important reason why physicians do not treat hypertension more aggressively is that they are willing to accept an elevated systolic {BP} in their patients.

In 1988, the Systolic Hypertension in China (Syst-China) Collaborative Group started to investigate whether active treatment could reduce the incidence of stroke and other cardiovascular complications in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension. {METHODS}: All patients were initially started on masked placebo. After stratification for centre, sex and previous cardiovascular complications, alternate patients (n=1253) were assigned nitrendipine at 10-40 mg daily, with the addition of captopril at 12.5-50.0 mg daily or hydrochlorothiazide at 12.5-50.0 mg daily, or both, if a sufficient blood pressure fall was not obtained. In the remaining 1141 control patients, matching placebos were administered similarly. {RESULTS}: At entry, sitting blood pressure averaged 170.5 {mmHg} systolic and 86.0 {mmHg} diastolic, age averaged 66.5 years and total serum cholesterol was 5.1 mmol/l. After 2 years of follow-up, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures had fallen by 10.9 {mmHg} and 1.9 {mmHg} in the placebo group and by 20.0 {mmHg} and 5.0 {mmHg} in the active treatment group. The intergroup differences were 9.1 {mmHg} systolic (95\% confidence interval 7.6-10.7 {mmHg} ) and 3.2 {mmHg} diastolic (95\% confidence interval 2.4-4.0). Active treatment reduced total strokes by 38\% (from 20.8 to 13.0 endpoints per 1000 patient-years, P=0.01), all-cause mortality by 39\% (from 28.4 to 17.4 endpoints per 1000 patient-years, P=0.003), cardiovascular mortality by 39\% (from 15.2 to 9.4 endpoints per 1000 patient-years, P=0.03), stroke mortality by 58\% (from 6.9 to 2.9 endpoints per 1000 patient-years, P=0.02), and ail fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular endpoints by 37\% (from 33.3 to 21.4 endpoints per 1000 patient-years, P=0.004). {CONCLUSIONS}: Antihypertensive treatment prevents stroke and other cardiovascular complications in older Chinese patients with isolated systolic hypertension.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has emerged as an important tool supporting physicians in the diagnosis and management of arterial hypertension. Compared with office measurements and self-measurements, however, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring shows the lowest patients' acceptance. The present study compares the convenience of different monitors in order to examine whether the patients benefit from new technologies. {METHODS}: In a prospective randomized study, we compared the side effects of the Spacelabs 90207 with the I.E.M. Mobilograph monitor in 250 patients by means of a questionnaire that covered the following aspects: restriction in everyday activities, noise, sleep disturbance, pain and mobility. Complaints were measured by a five-point scale ranging from 'no complaints at all' to 'severe complaints'. {RESULTS}: In all, 205 patients returned completed surveys (101 patients of the I.E.M. group, 104 patients of the Spacelabs group), yielding an 82\% final response rate. The overall mean complaint score was significantly higher in the Spacelabs group than in the I.E.M group (2.24 vs. 1.78; P{\textless}0.001). The Mobilograph revealed less discomfort in every single question and differences were significant for restrictions in everyday activities, noise, pain, disturbance of the patient's or the patient's partner's sleep and restrictions in walking. Sleep disturbance was the aspect with the highest difference in the two groups. {CONCLUSION}: The present work confirms that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring monitors are cumbersome to wear. Devices, however, differ in their comfort. Monitors with an improved convenience might lead to a higher patients' acceptance of this powerful diagnostic tool.},

Study authors were contacted for additional information. {WDAE} information was collected from the trials. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Ninety two trials evaluated the dose-related trough {BP} lowering efficacy of 14 different {ACE} inhibitors in 12 954 participants with a baseline {BP} of 157/101 mm Hg. The data do not suggest that any one {ACE} inhibitor is better or worse at lowering {BP}. A dose of 1/8 or 1/4 of the manufacturer's maximum recommended daily dose (Max) achieved a {BP} lowering effect that was 60 to 70\% of the {BP} lowering effect of Max. A dose of 1/2 Max achieved a {BP} lowering effect that was 90\% of Max. {ACE} inhibitor doses above Max did not significantly lower {BP} more than Max. Combining the effects of 1/2 Max and higher doses gives an estimate of the average trough {BP} lowering efficacy for {ACE} inhibitors as a class of drugs of -8 mm Hg for {SBP} and -5 mm Hg for {DBP}. {ACE} inhibitors reduced {BP} measured 1 to 12 hours after the dose by about 11/6 mm Hg. {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: There are no clinically meaningful {BP} lowering differences between different {ACE} inhibitors. The {BP} lowering effect of {ACE} inhibitors is modest; the magnitude of trough {BP} lowering at one-half the manufacturers' maximum recommended dose and above is -8/-5 mm Hg. Furthermore, 60 to 70\% of this trough {BP} lowering effect occurs with recommended starting doses. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with {ACE} inhibitors because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials.},

	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE}: Medications that influence the risk of dementia in the elderly can be relevant for dementia prevention. Proton pump inhibitors ({PPIs}) are widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases but have also been shown to be potentially involved in cognitive decline. {OBJECTIVE}: To examine the association between the use of {PPIs} and the risk of incident dementia in the elderly. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: We conducted a prospective cohort study using observational data from 2004 to 2011, derived from the largest German statutory health insurer, Allgemeine Ortskrankenkassen ({AOK}). Data on inpatient and outpatient diagnoses (coded by the German modification of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision) and drug prescriptions (categorized according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System) were available on a quarterly basis. Data analysis was performed from August to November 2015. {EXPOSURES}: Prescription of omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, or rabeprazole. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: The main outcome was a diagnosis of incident dementia coded by the German modification of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision. The association between {PPI} use and dementia was analyzed using time-dependent Cox regression. The model was adjusted for potential confounding factors, including age, sex, comorbidities, and polypharmacy. {RESULTS}: A total of 73,679 participants 75 years of age or older and free of dementia at baseline were analyzed. The patients receiving regular {PPI} medication (n = 2950; mean [{SD}] age, 83.8 [5.4] years; 77.9\% female) had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia compared with the patients not receiving {PPI} medication (n = 70,729; mean [{SD}] age, 83.0 [5.6] years; 73.6\% female) (hazard ratio, 1.44 [95\% {CI}, 1.36-1.52]; P {\textless} .001). {CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: The avoidance of {PPI} medication may prevent the development of dementia. This finding is supported by recent pharmacoepidemiological analyses on primary data and is in line with mouse models in which the use of {PPIs} increased the levels of beta-amyloid in the brains of mice.

The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of {OSA} and its associated factors in a large cohort of resistant hypertensive patients. {METHODS}: A cross-sectional analysis with 422 resistant hypertensive patients (31.3\% men; mean age = 62.4+/-9.9 years) submitted to a full-night polysomnography. The presence of {OSA} was defined by an apnea-hypopnea index ({AHI}) {\textgreater}5 per hour and moderate/severe {OSA} was defined by an {AHI} {\textgreater}15. Statistical analysis included bivariable comparisons between patients with and without moderate/severe {OSA} and logistic regressions to assess the independent correlates of {OSA} severity. {RESULTS}: Three-hundred forty-seven patients (82.2\%) had {OSA}, and 234 patients (55.5\%) had moderate/severe {OSA}. Patients with moderate/severe {OSA} were more frequently elderly and obese men with larger waist and neck circumferences, had higher prevalences of diabetes and left ventricular hypertrophy, and had higher proteinuria than patients with no/mild {OSA}. No difference was found in plasma aldosterone and renin activity. Nighttime systolic blood pressures and pulse pressures were higher in moderate/severe {OSA}, with lower nocturnal blood pressure fall. In multivariable logistic regression, male sex, older age, diabetes, obesity, increased waist and neck circumferences, and nighttime systolic blood pressure were the independent correlates of moderate/severe {OSA}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Resistant hypertensive patients had a very high prevalence of {OSA}, and patients with moderate/severe {OSA} had an adverse ambulatory {BP} profile, with higher nighttime systolic blood pressures and pulse pressures and higher prevalence of nondipping patterns.

The data came from 21 phase {IV} clinical studies, with lengths ranging from 30 to 330 days and involving 43 different antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin {II} receptor blockers (n=2088), calcium channel blockers (n=937), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n=665), beta blockers (n=195), and diuretics (n=155). About half of the patients who were prescribed an antihypertensive drug had stopped taking it within one year. On any day, patients who were still engaged with the drug dosing regimen omitted about 10\% of the scheduled doses: 42\% of these omissions were of a single day's dose, whereas 43\% were part of a sequence of several days (three or more days-that is, drug "holidays"). Almost half of the patients had at least one drug holiday a year. The likelihood that a patient would discontinue treatment early was inversely related to the quality of his or her daily execution of the dosing regimen. {CONCLUSIONS}: Early discontinuation of treatment and suboptimal daily execution of the prescribed regimens are the most common facets of poor adherence with once a day antihypertensive drug treatments. The shortfalls in drug exposure that these dosing errors create might be a common cause of low rates of blood pressure control and high variability in responses to prescribed antihypertensive drugs.},

The current study evaluated the effect of intensive versus moderate diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}) control on diabetic vascular complications in 480 normotensive type 2 diabetic patients. {METHODS}: The current study was a prospective, randomized controlled trial in normotensive type 2 diabetic subjects. The subjects were randomized to intensive (10 mm Hg below the baseline {DBP}) versus moderate (80 to 89 mm Hg) {DBP} control. Patients in the moderate therapy group were given placebo, while the patients randomized to intensive therapy received either nisoldipine or enalapril in a blinded manner as the initial antihypertensive medication. The primary end point evaluated was the change in creatinine clearance with the secondary endpoints consisting of change in urinary albumin excretion, progression of retinopathy and neuropathy and the incidence of cardiovascular disease. {RESULTS}: The mean follow-up was 5.3 years. Mean {BP} in the intensive group was 128 +/- 0.8/75 +/- 0.3 mm Hg versus 137 +/- 0.7/81 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in the moderate group, P {\textless} 0.0001. Although no difference was demonstrated in creatinine clearance (P = 0.43), a lower percentage of patients in the intensive group progressed from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria (P = 0.012) and microalbuminuria to overt albuminuria (P = 0.028). The intensive {BP} control group also demonstrated less progression of diabetic retinopathy (P = 0.019) and a lower incidence of strokes (P = 0.03). The results were the same whether enalapril or nisoldipine was used as the initial antihypertensive agent. {CONCLUSION}: Over a five-year follow-up period, intensive (approximately 128/75 mm Hg) {BP} control in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients: (1) slowed the progression to incipient and overt diabetic nephropathy; (2) decreased the progression of diabetic retinopathy; and (3) diminished the incidence of stroke.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To determine the quantitative efficacy of different classes of blood pressure lowering drugs in preventing coronary heart disease ({CHD}) and stroke, and who should receive treatment. {DESIGN}: Meta-analysis. Data source Medline (1966-2007). {STUDY} {SELECTION}: Randomised trials of blood pressure lowering drugs recording {CHD} events and strokes. 108 trials studied differences in blood pressure between study drug and placebo (or control group not receiving the study drug) ("blood pressure difference trials"), and 46 trials compared drugs ("drug comparison trials"). Seven trials with three randomised groups fell into both categories. The results were interpreted in the context of those expected from the largest published meta-analysis of cohort studies, totalling 958 000 people. {PARTICIPANTS}: 464 000 people defined into three mutually exclusive categories: participants with no history of vascular disease, a history of {CHD}, or a history of stroke. {RESULTS}: In the blood pressure difference trials beta blockers had a special effect over and above that due to blood pressure reduction in preventing recurrent {CHD} events in people with a history of {CHD}: risk reduction 29\% (95\% confidence interval 22\% to 34\%) compared with 15\% (11\% to 19\%) in trials of other drugs. The extra effect was limited to a few years after myocardial infarction, with a risk reduction of 31\% compared with 13\% in people with {CHD} with no recent infarct (P=0.04). In the other blood pressure difference trials (excluding {CHD} events in trials of beta blockers in people with {CHD}), there was a 22\% reduction in {CHD} events (17\% to 27\%) and a 41\% (33\% to 48\%) reduction in stroke for a blood pressure reduction of 10 mm Hg systolic or 5 mm Hg diastolic, similar to the reductions of 25\% ({CHD}) and 36\% (stroke) expected for the same difference in blood pressure from the cohort study meta-analysis, indicating that the benefit is explained by blood pressure reduction itself. The five main classes of blood pressure lowering drugs (thiazides, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers) were similarly effective (within a few percentage points) in preventing {CHD} events and strokes, with the exception that calcium channel blockers had a greater preventive effect on stroke (relative risk 0.92, 95\% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.98). The percentage reductions in {CHD} events and stroke were similar in people with and without cardiovascular disease and regardless of blood pressure before treatment (down to 110 mm Hg systolic and 70 mm Hg diastolic). Combining our results with those from two other studies (the meta-analyses of blood pressure cohort studies and of trials determining the blood pressure lowering effects of drugs according to dose) showed that in people aged 60-69 with a diastolic blood pressure before treatment of 90 mm Hg, three drugs at half standard dose in combination reduced the risk of {CHD} by an estimated 46\% and of stroke by 62\%; one drug at standard dose had about half this effect. The present meta-analysis also showed that drugs other than calcium channel blockers (with the exception of non-cardioselective beta blockers) reduced the incidence of heart failure by 24\% (19\% to 28\%) and calcium channel blockers by 19\% (6\% to 31\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: With the exception of the extra protective effect of beta blockers given shortly after a myocardial infarction and the minor additional effect of calcium channel blockers in preventing stroke, all the classes of blood pressure lowering drugs have a similar effect in reducing {CHD} events and stroke for a given reduction in blood pressure so excluding material pleiotropic effects. The proportional reduction in cardiovascular disease events was the same or similar regardless of pretreatment blood pressure and the presence or absence of existing cardiovascular disease. Guidelines on the use of blood pressure lowering drugs can be simplified so that drugs are offered to people with all levels of blood pressure. Our results indicate the importance of lowering blood pressure in everyone over a certain age, rather than measuring it in everyone and treating it in some.},

	abstract = {The production of the pineal hormone melatonin is synchronized with day-night cycle via multisynaptic pathway including suprachiasmatic nucleus linking several physiological functions to diurnal cycle. The recent data indicate that impaired melatonin production is involved in several cardiovascular pathologies including hypertension and ischemic heart disease. However, the mechanisms of melatonin effect on cardiovascular system are still not completely understood. The activation of melatonin receptors on endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells and antioxidant properties of melatonin could be responsible for the melatonin effects on vascular tone. However, the data from in vitro studies are controversial making the explanation of the melatonin effect on blood pressure in vivo difficult. In vivo, melatonin also attenuates sympathetic tone by direct activation of melatonin receptors, scavenging free radicals or increasing {NO} availability in the central nervous system. The central and peripheral antiadrenergic action of chronic melatonin treatment might eliminate the mechanisms counter-regulating decreased blood pressure, providing thus additional cardioprotective mechanism. The extraordinary antioxidant activity and antilipidemic effects of melatonin may enhance the modulation of blood pressure by melatonin and probably play the most important role in the amelioration of target organ damage by chronic melatonin treatment. Further investigation of these mechanisms should provide novel knowledge about pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases, additional explanation for their circadian and seasonal variability and potentially generate new impulses for the development of therapeutic arsenal.},

	abstract = {Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, phase 2 (1991 to 1994), indicate that among hypertensive individuals in the United States, 53.6\% are treated and only 27.4\% are controlled to goal levels. We sought to determine whether poor hypertension control is due to lack of systolic or diastolic blood pressure control, or both. We studied Framingham Heart Study participants examined between 1990 and 1995 and determined rates of control to systolic goal ({\textless}140 mm Hg), diastolic goal ({\textless}90 mm Hg), or both (systolic {\textless}140 and diastolic {\textless}90 mm Hg). Of 1959 hypertensive subjects (mean age 66 years, 54\% women), 32.7\% were controlled to systolic goal, 82.9\% were controlled to diastolic goal, and only 29.0\% were controlled to both. Among the 1189 subjects who were receiving antihypertensive therapy (60.7\% of all hypertensive subjects), 49.0\% were controlled to systolic goal, 89.7\% were controlled to diastolic goal, and only 47.8\% were controlled to both. Thus, poor systolic blood pressure control was overwhelmingly responsible for poor rates of overall control to goal. Covariates associated with lack of systolic control in treated subjects included older age ({OR} for age 61 to 75 years, 2.43, 95\% {CI} 1.79 to 3.29; {OR} for age {\textgreater}75 years, 4.34, 95\% {CI} 3.10 to 6.09), left ventricular hypertrophy ({OR} 1.63, 95\% {CI} 1.04 to 2.54), and obesity ({OR} for body mass index {\textgreater}/=30 versus {\textless}25 kg/m(2), 1.49, 95\% {CI} 1.08 to 2.06). In this community-based sample of middle-aged and older subjects, overall rates of hypertension control were remarkably similar to those in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Poor blood pressure control was overwhelmingly due to lack of systolic control, even among treated subjects. Therefore, clinicians and policymakers should place greater emphasis on the achievement of goal systolic levels in all hypertensive patients, especially those who are older or obese or have target organ damage.},

Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events. We extracted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}) which were pooled with a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I statistic. {RESULTS}: We identified eight studies with 17 698 participants. Follow-up was 3.2-10.9 years. For all-cause mortality (n = 747) the hazard ratio for home {BP} was 1.14 (95\% {CI} 1.01-1.29) per 10 {mmHg} increase in systolic {BP} compared to 1.07 (0.91-1.26) for office {BP}. For cardiovascular mortality (n = 193) the hazard ratio for home {BP} was 1.29 (1.02-1.64) per 10 {mmHg} increase in systolic {BP} compared to 1.15 (0.91-1.46) for office {BP}. For cardiovascular events (n = 699) the hazard ratio for home {BP} was 1.14 (1.09-1.20) per 10 {mmHg} increase in systolic {BP} compared to 1.10 (1.06-1.15) for office {BP}. In three studies which adjusted for office and home {BP} the hazard ratio was 1.20 (1.11-1.30) per 10 {mmHg} increase in systolic {BP} for home {BP} adjusted for office {BP} compared to 0.99 (0.93-1.07) per 10 {mmHg} increase in systolic {BP} for office {BP} adjusted for home {BP}.

	abstract = {Many cases of end-stage renal disease ({ESRD}) are ascribed to hypertension. However, because renal disease itself can raise blood pressure, some investigators argue that {ESRD} seen in patients with hypertension is due to underlying primary renal disease. Previous cohort studies of the relationship between blood pressure and {ESRD} did not uniformly screen out baseline kidney disease.{\textbar}We conducted a historical cohort study among members of Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, a large integrated health care delivery system. The {ESRD} cases were ascertained by matching with the {US} Renal Data System registry.{\textbar}A total of 316 675 adult Kaiser members participated in the Multiphasic Health Checkups from 1964 to 1985. All subjects had estimated glomerular filtration rates of 60 {mL} /min per 1.73 m(2) or higher and negative dipstick urinalysis results for proteinuria or hematuria. During 8 210 431 person-years of follow-up, 1149 cases of {ESRD} occurred. Compared with subjects with a blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg, the adjusted relative risks for developing {ESRD} were 1.62 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.27-2.07) for blood pressures of 120 to 129/80 to 84 mm Hg, 1.98 (95\% {CI}, 1.55-2.52) for blood pressures of 130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg, 2.59 (95\% {CI}, 2.07-3.25) for blood pressures of 140 to 159/90 to 99 mm Hg, 3.86 (95\% {CI}, 3.00-4.96) for blood pressures of 160 to 179/100 to 109 mm Hg, 3.88 (95\% {CI}, 2.82-5.34) for blood pressures of 180 to 209/110 to 119 mm Hg, and 4.25 (95\% {CI}, 2.63-6.86) for blood pressures of 210/120 mm Hg or higher.

	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE}: Understanding the major health problems in the United States and how they are changing over time is critical for informing national health policy. {OBJECTIVES}: To measure the burden of diseases, injuries, and leading risk factors in the United States from 1990 to 2010 and to compare these measurements with those of the 34 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ({OECD}) countries. {DESIGN}: We used the systematic analysis of descriptive epidemiology of 291 diseases and injuries, 1160 sequelae of these diseases and injuries, and 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors from 1990 to 2010 for 187 countries developed for the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study to describe the health status of the United States and to compare {US} health outcomes with those of 34 {OECD} countries. Years of life lost due to premature mortality ({YLLs}) were computed by multiplying the number of deaths at each age by a reference life expectancy at that age. Years lived with disability ({YLDs}) were calculated by multiplying prevalence (based on systematic reviews) by the disability weight (based on population-based surveys) for each sequela; disability in this study refers to any short- or long-term loss of health. Disability-adjusted life-years ({DALYs}) were estimated as the sum of {YLDs} and {YLLs}. Deaths and {DALYs} related to risk factors were based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses of exposure data and relative risks for risk-outcome pairs. Healthy life expectancy ({HALE}) was used to summarize overall population health, accounting for both length of life and levels of ill health experienced at different ages. {RESULTS}: {US} life expectancy for both sexes combined increased from 75.2 years in 1990 to 78.2 years in 2010; during the same period, {HALE} increased from 65.8 years to 68.1 years. The diseases and injuries with the largest number of {YLLs} in 2010 were ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and road injury. Age-standardized {YLL} rates increased for Alzheimer disease, drug use disorders, chronic kidney disease, kidney cancer, and falls. The diseases with the largest number of {YLDs} in 2010 were low back pain, major depressive disorder, other musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety disorders. As the {US} population has aged, {YLDs} have comprised a larger share of {DALYs} than have {YLLs}. The leading risk factors related to {DALYs} were dietary risks, tobacco smoking, high body mass index, high blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Among 34 {OECD} countries between 1990 and 2010, the {US} rank for the age-standardized death rate changed from 18th to 27th, for the age-standardized {YLL} rate from 23rd to 28th, for the age-standardized {YLD} rate from 5th to 6th, for life expectancy at birth from 20th to 27th, and for {HALE} from 14th to 26th. {CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: From 1990 to 2010, the United States made substantial progress in improving health. Life expectancy at birth and {HALE} increased, all-cause death rates at all ages decreased, and age-specific rates of years lived with disability remained stable. However, morbidity and chronic disability now account for nearly half of the {US} health burden, and improvements in population health in the United States have not kept pace with advances in population health in other wealthy nations.},

Increasing proportions of negative side effects due to extensive pharmacological treatment are however observed especially among elderly patients who have multiple health problems. The aim of our study was to see if there is an association between medication quality and quality of life. {METHODS}: 150 patients discharged from hospital. Inclusion criteria were: living in ordinary homes, {\textgreater}/= 75 years and {\textgreater}/= 5 drugs. Home visits were performed to all, including prescription reviews and calculation of medication appropriateness index. The patients were divided into three groups depending on index score and followed for 12 months. The validated and recognized {EQ}-5D and {EQ} {VAS} instruments were used to assess quality of life. {RESULTS}: A lower medication quality was associated with a lower quality of life. {EQ}-5D index was statistically significantly different (declining for each group) among the groups (p = 0.001 at study start, p = 0.001 at 6 months and p = 0.013 at 12 months) as was {EQ} {VAS} (p = 0.026 at study start, p = 0.003 at 6 months and p = 0.007 at 12 months). {CONCLUSIONS}: This study has shown the validity of the basic principle in prescribing: the more appropriate medication the better quality of life. Since drug quality is related to the patients' quality of life, there is immense reason to continuously evaluate every prescription and treatment. The evaluation and if possible deprescribing should be done as a process where both the patient and physician are involved.},

Trained interviewers administered trail-making tests (Trail A and B), Brief Assessment Index (a measure of depressed mood) and four subscales from the Sickness Impact Profile (Ambulation, Social Interaction, Sleep and Rest, and Home work). {RESULTS}: Six hundred and ten patients completed a baseline and at least one follow-up questionnaire. Trail-making scores were slower in actively treated patients, especially in the first 6 months of follow-up when the between-group effect sizes were 0.25 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.07 to 0.43] for Trail-making A and 0.13 (95\% {CI} -0.05 to 0.31) for Trail-making B.

Additionally, there was a significantly higher aortic systolic tension time index, an index of left-ventricular myocardial oxygen demand, in the {LVAD} group compared with the inotrope group (2655 +/- 298 mm Hg/sec/min v 1748 +/- 303 mm Hg/sec/min, P {\textless} .01). {CONCLUSIONS}: Central arterial pressure-wave reflection is increased in end-stage {HF} patients on {LVAD} support compared with those on inotropic drugs, leading to an increase in aortic augmented pressure, {AI}(a), and systolic tension time index. The {AI}(a) is also higher in {LVAD} patients than in healthy controls. This increased central arterial-wave reflection places an additional hemodynamic load on the {LVAD} device and may have relevance to the medical management of patients after {LVAD} placement and to the longevity of the {LVAD} device itself.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular and renal diseases are associated with many risk factors, of which hypertension is one of the most prevalent. Worldwide, blood pressure control is only achieved in approximately 50\% of those treated for hypertension, despite the availability of a considerable number of antihypertensive drugs from different pharmacological classes. Although many reasons exist for poor blood pressure control, a likely contributor is the inability to predict to which antihypertensive drug an individual is most likely to respond. Hypertension pharmacogenomics and other 'omics' technologies have the potential to identify genetic signals that are predictive of response or adverse outcome to particular drugs, and guide selection of hypertension treatment for a given individual. Continued research in this field will enhance our understanding of how to maximally deploy the various antihypertensive drug classes to optimize blood pressure response at the individual level. This Review summarizes the available literature on the most convincing genetic signals associated with antihypertensive drug responses and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Future research in this area will be facilitated by enhancing collaboration between research groups through consortia such as the International Consortium for Antihypertensives Pharmacogenomics Studies, with the goal of translating replicated findings into clinical implementation.},

To evaluate the effectiveness of reminders on improving the follow-up of patients with hypertension. {SEARCH} {STRATEGY}: All-language search of all articles (any year) in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register ({CCTR}) and Medline; and Embase from January 1980. {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: Randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) of patients with hypertension that evaluated the following interventions: (1) self-monitoring (2) educational interventions directed to the patient (3) educational interventions directed to the health professional (4) health professional (nurse or pharmacist) led care (5) organisational interventions that aimed to improve the delivery of care (6) appointment reminder {systemsOutcomes} assessed were: (1) mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (2) control of blood pressure (3) proportion of patients followed up at clinic {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two authors extracted data independently and in duplicate and assessed each study according to the criteria outlined by the Cochrane Handbook. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: 72 {RCTs} met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of included studies varied. An organized system of regular review allied to vigorous antihypertensive drug therapy was shown to reduce systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference ({WMD}) -8.0 {mmHg}, 95\% {CI}: -8.8 to -7.2 {mmHg}) and diastolic blood pressure ({WMD} -4.3 {mmHg}, 95\% {CI}: -4.7 to -3.9 {mmHg}) for three strata of entry blood pressure, and all-cause mortality at five years follow-up (6.4\% versus 7.8\%, difference 1.4\%) in a single large {RCT}- the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up study. Other interventions had variable effects. Self-monitoring was associated with moderate net reduction in systolic blood pressure ({WMD} -2.5 {mmHg}, 95\% {CI}: -3.7 to -1.3 {mmHg}) and diastolic blood pressure ({WMD} -1.8 {mmHg}, 95\% {CI}: -2.4 to -1.2 {mmHg}). {RCTs} of educational interventions directed at patients or health professionals were heterogeneous but appeared unlikely to be associated with large net reductions in blood pressure by themselves. Nurse or pharmacist led care may be a promising way forward, with the majority of {RCTs} being associated with improved blood pressure control and mean {SBP} and {DBP} but these interventions require further evaluation. Appointment reminder systems also require further evaluation due to heterogeneity and small trial numbers, but the majority of trials increased the proportion of individuals who attended for follow-up (odds ratio 0.41, 95\% {CI} 0.32 to 0.51) and in two small trials also led to improved blood pressure control, odds ratio favouring intervention 0.54 (95\% {CI} 0.41 to 0.73). {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Family practices and community-based clinics need to have an organized system of regular follow-up and review of their hypertensive patients. Antihypertensive drug therapy should be implemented by means of a vigorous stepped care approach when patients do not reach target blood pressure levels. Self-monitoring and appointment reminders may be useful adjuncts to the above strategies to improve blood pressure control but require further evaluation.},

The aim of this study was to identify type 2 diabetes (T2D) cases and controls for a {GWAS}, using data captured through routine clinical care across five institutions using different electronic medical record ({EMR}) systems. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: An algorithm was developed to identify T2D cases and controls based on a combination of diagnoses, medications, and laboratory results. The performance of the algorithm was validated at three of the five participating institutions compared against clinician review. A {GWAS} was subsequently performed using cases and controls identified by the algorithm, with samples pooled across all five institutions. {RESULTS}: The algorithm achieved 98\% and 100\% positive predictive values for the identification of diabetic cases and controls, respectively, as compared against clinician review. By standardizing and applying the algorithm across institutions, 3353 cases and 3352 controls were identified. Subsequent {GWAS} using data from five institutions replicated the {TCF}7L2 gene variant (rs7903146) previously associated with T2D. {DISCUSSION}: By applying stringent criteria to {EMR} data collected through routine clinical care, cases and controls for a {GWAS} were identified that subsequently replicated a known genetic variant. The use of standard terminologies to define data elements enabled pooling of subjects and data across five different institutions to achieve the robust numbers required for {GWAS}. {CONCLUSIONS}: An algorithm using commonly available data from five different {EMR} can accurately identify T2D cases and controls for genetic study across multiple institutions.},

This study determined the relationship between the number of medications dispensed and adherence with chronic cardiovascular regimens. {METHODS}: A survey was administered to 367 patients who had taken an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or lipid-lowering medication for at least 3 consecutive months. Information was collected on nonprescription drug use, demographics, adverse effects, and use of adherence aids. Prescription drug use data over the previous 12 months were obtained for each subject from the British Columbia prescription claims database.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify predictors of nonadherence ({\textless}80\%) with cardiovascular medications. {RESULTS}: Forty-five subjects (12\%) were categorized as nonadherent. Nonadherent subjects took fewer regularly scheduled prescription medications per day (4.1 +/- 2.7 vs. 5.9 +/- 3.4; p = 0.001), fewer pills per day (5.3 +/- 3.6 vs. 9.2 +/- 7.1; p {\textless} 0.001), and had fewer administration times per day (1.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.9; p = 0.001).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Clinical Pharmacist Practitioners are advanced practicing pharmacists in North Carolina that provide disease-specific management. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the efficacy and charges from referrals to a Clinical Pharmacist Practitioner by the primary care provider, to those managed by a primary care provider alone. {METHODS}: Patients were separated into cohorts depending if they had at least two appointments with a Clinical Pharmacist Practitioner from November 2008 to November 2011. A primary care provider saw all patients at least twice during the study period. Cohorts were then matched by age, gender, and disease states. Medicare billed data was evaluated from outpatient visits related to hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral neuropathy, as well as emergency department visits and inpatient admissions. Cost of medications was estimated using 2009 {AWP} data corresponding to medication histories within the electronic medical record. Efficacy was defined as ability to reach disease state goal determined using national guidelines and reduction in pain score. Efficacy was analyzed by difference-in-differences test and all other numerical data tested by paired t-tests. {RESULTS}: The Clinical Pharmacist Practitioners cohort experienced more outpatient visits (1338 vs. 858, p {\textless} 0.001), fewer emergency department visits (115 vs. 190, p {\textless} 0.05), and similar inpatient admissions (88 vs. 117, p {\textgreater} 0.05) than the primary care providers cohort, respectively. The Clinical Pharmacist Practitioners cohort showed changes in charges of +22.6 \% for outpatient visits, -45.5 \% emergency department visits, and -13.2 \% inpatient admissions relative to the primary care provider cohort. There was no difference in average daily medication cost (Clinical Pharmacist Practitioners \$38.52 vs. primary care providers \$38.23, p = 0.97) or achievement of disease state goals. {CONCLUSION}: {APPLE}-{NC} demonstrated that through referrals, Clinical Pharmacist Practitioners provide services comparable in charges and efficacy to primary care providers. Consequently, the current increased need for primary care practitioners can be met in part by increasing the utilization of advanced practice pharmacists for chronic disease management. {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: This does not apply for this retrospective cohort study.},

	abstract = {Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ({ABPM}) is increasingly recommended for confirming hypertension diagnosis and ongoing hypertension monitoring. However, reimbursement in the United States is variable and low compared with other advanced health care systems. We examined the reimbursement of {ABPM} and factors associated with successful reimbursement. A retrospective analysis of {IBM} {MarketScan}((R)) commercial claims database was conducted for patients {\textgreater}/=18 years with {\textgreater}/=1 {ABPM} claim from January 2012 to December 2016. The date of first the {ABPM} claim was used as the index date. Per-beneficiary {ABPM} episode reimbursements were calculated by aggregating all {ABPM}-related reimbursements within a 30-day post-index window, considered as an {ABPM} episode. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of successful reimbursement. Of 20 875 beneficiaries with {ABPM} claims, 16 920 (81.0\%) were reimbursed. The median reimbursement per beneficiary for an {ABPM} episode was \$89 (Inter Quartile Range [{IQR}], \$62, \$132), driven primarily by reimbursement for the full procedure (median, \$86; {IQR}, \$66, \$110). Comparing benefit plan types, consumer-directed health plans provided the highest median reimbursement (\$96; {IQR}, \$61, \$175). Successful reimbursement was associated with female patient sex (adjusted {OR} [{aOR}], 1.20; 95\% {CI}, 1.11-1.28), having a health maintenance organization ({aOR} 2.11; 95\% {CI}, 1.82-2.43) or point of service ({aOR} 2.08; 95\% {CI}, 1.74-2.49) as benefit plan types, claim filing by a specialist ({aOR} 1.26; 95\% {CI}, 1.14-1.40) and services provided at an outpatient hospital ({aOR} 1.17; 95\% {CI}, 1.01-1.35).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In 2001-2002, the American Heart Association and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute initiated national campaigns with the aim of increasing women's awareness of their risk of heart disease, with particular focus on women aged 40 to 60 years. Our aim is to determine if these women's awareness campaigns were associated with a reduction in the time to hospital presentation for myocardial infarction in women. {METHODS}: The study population comprised patients who presented with a non-{ST}-segment elevation myocardial infarction in the Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress {ADverse} Outcomes with Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines Registry and the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network-Get with the Guidelines registry. Analysis was done based on the introduction of the educational intervention: preintervention 2002-2003, intermediate 2004-2005, and post 2006-2007. {RESULTS}: Of 125,161 patients, 50,162 (40.1\%) are women. The median time from symptom onset to presentation was significantly longer in women than men: 3 hours (interquartile range 1.4-7.6) versus 2.8 hours (interquartile range 1.3-7.2, P {\textless} .0001), a difference that remained significant after adjusting for clinical characteristics. There was no measurable reduction in the time from symptom onset to presentation over the period of the awareness campaigns: post- versus preintervention period (-0.18\%, 95\% {CI} -3.02\% to 2.74\%). After adjustment for covariates, women aged 40 to 60 years had a 3.46\% longer time to presentation than men (95\% {CI} 1.06-5.92, P = .005). {CONCLUSIONS}: There was no reduction in time from symptom onset to hospital presentation for myocardial infarction patients since national awareness campaigns in women were initiated, and a significant gender gap remains.},

	abstract = {The traditional workup for primary aldosteronism is cumbersome and requires discontinuing antihypertensive medications, which is inconvenient and potentially dangerous. A simple and accurate screening test that can be used without modifying medications is needed. The plasma aldosterone-renin ratio ({ARR}) is a valid screening assay for primary aldosteronism, but antihypertensives are usually discontinued before obtaining this ratio, limiting its utility. The present prospective study is designed to examine the validity of the {ARR} as a screening test for primary aldosteronism if the ratio is measured randomly while patients continue antihypertensive therapy. During the 18-month study period, 90 patients were referred to the hypertension clinic with poorly controlled hypertension. {ARR} was measured in random blood samples in all 90 patients while maintaining their prescribed antihypertensive medications. Those with elevated {ARRs} ({\textgreater}100 ng/{dL} / ng/{mL}/h) underwent further diagnostic workup, including adrenal computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging and adrenal iodine 131 norcholesterol uptake scan. Fifteen patients (17\%) had elevated {ARRs} greater than 100:1. Ten of 15 patients were found to have adrenal adenoma on diagnostic workup, and adenoma was later confirmed by histological examination after surgical removal in these 10 patients. Five patients were found to have adrenal hyperplasia; all 5 patients responded to antialdosterone treatment. Thus, all 15 patients had good control of blood pressure after surgery and/or antialdosterone medications. No patient showed a falsely elevated {ARR}. Data suggest that the {ARR} is a valid screening assay for primary aldosteronism in patients with poorly controlled blood pressure, and discontinuation of antihypertensive medications is not needed for this test.},

Systolic blood pressure ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Of the participants, 3161 were not receiving antihypertensive medication at initial contact, and 1575 were. The average systolic blood pressure was 170 mm Hg; average diastolic blood pressure, 77 mm Hg. The mean age was 72 years, 57\% were women, and 14\% were black. {INTERVENTIONS}: --Participants were stratified by clinical center and by antihypertensive medication status at initial contact. For step 1 of the trial, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 25 mg/d. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol, 25 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 50 mg/d. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Primary. Nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke. Secondary. Cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life measures. {RESULTS}: Average follow-up was 4.5 years. The 5-year average systolic blood pressure was 155 mm Hg for the placebo group and 143 mm Hg for the active treatment group, and the 5-year average diastolic blood pressure was 72 and 68 mm Hg, respectively. The 5-year incidence of total stroke was 5.2 per 100 participants for active treatment and 8.2 per 100 for placebo. The relative risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.64 (P = .0003). For the secondary end point of clinical nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death, the relative risk was 0.73. Major cardiovascular events were reduced (relative risk, 0.68). For deaths from all causes, the relative risk was 0.87. {CONCLUSION}: In persons aged 60 years and over with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care drug treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone as step 1 medication reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36\%, with 5-year absolute benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants. Major cardiovascular events were reduced, with 5-year absolute benefit of 55 events per 1000.},

	abstract = {The role of spironolactone in resistant hypertension management is unclear. The aim of this prospective trial was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of spironolactone in patients with true resistant hypertension diagnosed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A total of 175 patients had clinical and complementary exams obtained at baseline and received spironolactone in doses of 25 to 100 mg/d. A second ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed after a median interval of 7 months. Paired Student t test was used to assess differences in blood pressure before and during spironolactone administration, and multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, and number of antihypertensive drugs to assess the predictors of blood pressure fall. There were mean reductions of 16 and 9 mm Hg, respectively, in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures (95\% {CIs}: 13 to 18 and 7 to 10 mm Hg; P{\textless}0.001). Office systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure also decreased (14 and 7 mm Hg). Controlled ambulatory blood pressure was reached in 48\% of patients. Factors associated with better response were higher waist circumference, lower aortic pulse wave velocity, and lower serum potassium. No association with plasma aldosterone or aldosterone:renin ratio was found. Adverse effects were observed in 13 patients (7.4\%). A third ambulatory blood pressure monitoring performed in 78 patients after a median of 15 months confirmed the persistence of the spironolactone effect. In conclusion, spironolactone administration to true resistant hypertensive patients is safe and effective in decreasing blood pressure, especially in those with abdominal obesity and lower arterial stiffness. Its addition to an antihypertensive regimen as the fourth or fifth drug is recommended.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Hypertension as the primary reason for hospitalization is often used to indicate failure of the outpatient health-care system to prevent and control high blood pressure. Investigators have reported increased rates of these preventable hospitalizations for black people compared with white people; however, none have mapped them nationally by race. {METHODS}: We used Medicare Part A data to estimate preventable hypertension hospitalizations from 2004-2009 using technical specifications published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Rates per 100,000 beneficiaries were age- and sex-standardized to 2000 U.S. Census data. We mapped county-level rates by race and identified clusters of counties with extreme rates. {RESULTS}: Black people had higher crude rates of these hospitalizations than white people for every year studied, and the test for an increasing linear time trend for the standardized rates was significant for both black and white people; that is, the gap between the races increased over time. For both races, clusters of high-rate counties occurred primarily in parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Southern Alabama, and Louisiana. High rates for white people were also found in parts of Appalachia. Large differences in rates among black and white people were found in a number of large urban areas and in parts of Florida and Alabama. {CONCLUSIONS}: Racial disparities in preventable hospitalizations for hypertension persisted through 2009. The gap between black and white people is increasing, and these inequities exist unevenly across the country. Although this study was intended to be purely descriptive, future studies should use multivariate analyses to examine reasons for these unequal distributions.},

	abstract = {Electronic health records ({EHR}) data are increasingly seen as a resource for cost-effective comparative effectiveness research ({CER}). Since {EHR} data are collected primarily for clinical and/or billing purposes, their use for {CER} requires consideration of numerous methodologic challenges including the potential for confounding bias, due to a lack of randomization, and for selection bias, due to missing data. In contrast to the recent literature on confounding bias in {EHR}-based {CER}, virtually no attention has been paid to selection bias possibly due to the belief that standard methods for missing data can be readily-applied. Such methods, however, hinge on an overly simplistic view of the available/missing {EHR} data, so that their application in the {EHR} setting will often fail to completely control selection bias. Motivated by challenges we face in an on-going {EHR}-based comparative effectiveness study of choice of antidepressant treatment and long-term weight change, we propose a new general framework for selection bias in {EHR}-based {CER}. Crucially, the framework provides structure within which researchers can consider the complex interplay between numerous decisions, made by patients and health care providers, which give rise to health-related information being recorded in the {EHR} system, as well as the wide variability across {EHR} systems themselves. This, in turn, provides structure within which: (i) the transparency of assumptions regarding missing data can be enhanced, (ii) factors relevant to each decision can be elicited, and (iii) statistical methods can be better aligned with the complexity of the data.},

With multiple daily injections as reference, the adjusted hazard ratios for insulin pump treatment were significantly lower: 0.55 (95\% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.83) for fatal coronary heart disease, 0.58 (0.40 to 0.85) for fatal cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease or stroke), and 0.73 (0.58 to 0.92) for all cause mortality. Hazard ratios were lower, but not significantly so, for fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease and fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular disease. Unadjusted absolute differences were 3.0 events of fatal coronary heart disease per 1000 person years; corresponding figures were 3.3 for fatal cardiovascular disease and 5.7 for all cause mortality. When lower body mass index and previous cardiovascular diseases were excluded, results of subgroup analyses were similar to the results from complete data. A sensitivity analysis of unmeasured confounders in all individuals showed that an unmeasured confounders with hazard ratio of 1.3 would have to be present in {\textgreater}80\% of the individuals treated with multiple daily injections versus not presence in those treated with pump therapy to invalidate the significantly lower hazard ratios for fatal cardiovascular disease. Data on patient education and frequency of blood glucose monitoring were missing, which might have influenced the observed association. {CONCLUSION}: Among people with type 1 diabetes use of insulin pump therapy is associated with lower cardiovascular mortality than treatment with multiple daily insulin injections.},

(2) Is prevention of all outcomes proportional to the extent of systolic, diastolic, and pulse {BP}? (3) Have all classes of {BP}-lowering drugs been shown capable of reducing all types of cardiovascular outcome? (4) Is {BP} lowering beneficial when intervention is initiated at any grade (or stage) of hypertension? (5) Do {BP}-lowering randomized controlled trials provide evidence about systolic {BP} and diastolic {BP} targets of treatment? (6) Should {BP}-lowering treatment be preferentially addressed to patients in higher risk categories promising larger absolute treatment benefits? The results of these meta-analyses provide further support to current hypertension treatment guidelines by showing that {BP} lowering can significantly reduce major cardiovascular outcomes largely independent of the agents used, significant risk reduction is found at all hypertension grades (stages), and when systolic {BP} is lowered below a cut off of 140 mm Hg with some further reduction limited to stroke at systolic {BP} values just {\textless}130 mm Hg. Absolute risk reduction progressively increases higher is total cardiovascular risk, but this greater benefit is associated with a progressively higher residual risk, ie, higher treatment failures.},

Whether they also provide benefit to patients with coronary artery disease in the absence of congestive heart failure via an antiatherosclerotic mechanism is a question the {QUinapril} Ischemic Event Trial quantitative coronary angiography ({QCA}) study attempted to answer: 1,750 patients with normal left ventricular function who were undergoing coronary angiography and angioplasty were randomized to 20 mg/day of quinapril versus placebo and followed for 3 years for cardiac end points. A randomly selected subgroup of the total cohort underwent follow-up angiography. The primary {QCA} end point was the categorical designation of progression versus nonprogression, defined either by {QCA} or by a cardiac event in patients selected for the {QCA} trial who had no usable follow-up x-ray film. Secondary end points in patients with 2 angiograms were: new stenosis development, change in minimum lumen diameter index, and change in percent diameter stenosis index. There were 119 progressors among 243 placebo-treated patients (49\%) and 111 progressors among 234 quinapril-treated patients (47\%) (p = {NS}). There were 44 patients with new stenosis development in the placebo group (19\%) and 50 (22\%) in the quinapril group (p = {NS}).

Participants were randomized to either a usual mean arterial blood pressure ({MAP}) goal group (102-107 mm Hg) or a low-{MAP} goal group ({\textless} or = 92 mm Hg) and to a drug regimen (initial therapy with either atenolol, amlodipine, or enalapril). Quality of life was assessed by the Medical Outcomes Short-Form 36 ({MOS} {SF}-36) at baseline and the last follow-up visit for 84 of the 94 participants of the {AASK} Pilot Study. Symptoms were assessed at baseline and throughout the course of therapy by participant self-report. Mean {SF}-36 scores increased significantly on physical functioning (9.2), role limitations (physical) (19.0), social functioning (9.0), and vitality dimensions (5.6) from baseline to the last follow-up visit in the usual {MAP} goal group. Scores for the eight health dimensions assessed by the {MOS} {SF}-36 did not change significantly during the same time period either in the low-{MAP} goal group or in any of the drug regimens. The mean score for general health perception was significantly lower at the last follow-up visit in the enalapril drug regimen (49.9) compared to drug regimens with atenolol (65.4) or amlodipine (63.9). Physical functioning, role limitations (emotional), social functioning, mental health, vitality, and general health perception scores were negatively correlated with self-reported symptoms during treatment. We conclude that selected dimensions of quality of life improved during the {AASK} Pilot Study only in participants randomized to the usual {MAP} goal group. Significant differences between {MAP} goal groups and drug regimens at the end of follow-up were observed for only a few health dimensions.},

Meta-analyses comprehensive of all {RCTs} but limited to {RCTs} investigating blood pressure ({BP}) lowering in hypertensive patients are lacking. {OBJECTIVES}: Two clinical questions were investigated: the extent of different outcome reductions by {BP} lowering in hypertensive patients, and the proportionality of outcome reductions to {SBP}, {DBP}, and pulse pressure ({PP}) reductions. {METHODS}: {PubMed} between 1966 and December 2013 (any language), Cochrane Collaboration Library and previous overviews were used as data sources for identifying and selecting all {RCTs} comparing the antihypertensive drugs with placebo or less intense {BP} lowering (intentional {BP}-lowering {RCTs}); comparing {BP}-lowering drugs with placebo without {BP}-lowering intention, but with {BP} difference (nonintentional {BP}-lowering {RCTs}); and enrolling at least 40\% hypertensive patients. {RCTs} on acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, acute stroke, and dialysis were excluded. {RCT} quality was assessed by scoring. Risk ratios and 95\% confidence interval ({CI}), standardized to 10/5 {mmHg} {SBP}/{DBP} reduction, of seven fatal and nonfatal outcomes were calculated (random-effects model). The relationships of different outcome reductions to {SBP}, {DBP}, and {PP} reductions were investigated by meta-regressions. {RESULTS}: A total of 68 {RCTs} (245,885 individuals) were eligible, of which 47 (153,825 individuals) were 'intentional' {RCTs}. All outcomes were reduced (P {\textless} 0.001) by {BP} lowering, stroke [-36\% (-29, -42)], and heart failure [-43\% (-28, -54)] to a greater extent, with smaller reductions for coronary events [coronary heart disease ({CHD}): -16\% (-10, -21)], cardiovascular [-18\% (-11, -24)], and all-cause mortality [-11\% (-5, -16)]. Absolute risk reductions were 17 (14, 20) strokes, 28 (19, 35) cardiovascular events, and 8 (4, 12) deaths prevented every 1000 patients treated for 5 years. Logarithmic risk ratios were related to {SBP}, {DBP}, and {PP} reductions (P = 0.001-0.003) for stroke and composite cardiovascular events, but not for {CHD}. {CONCLUSION}: Meta-analyses of all {BP}-lowering {RCTs} involving hypertensive patients provide precise estimates of benefits (larger for stroke and heart failure, but also significant for {CHD} and mortality). Absolute risk reductions are substantial. Relationships of logarithmic risk ratios with {BP} reductions imply risk reduction increases progressively to a smaller extent the larger the {BP} reduction.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: To date, our ability to accurately identify patients at high risk from suicidal behaviour, and thus to target interventions, has been fairly limited. This study examined a large pool of factors that are potentially associated with suicide risk from the comprehensive electronic medical record ({EMR}) and to derive a predictive model for 1-6 month risk. {METHODS}: 7,399 patients undergoing suicide risk assessment were followed up for 180 days. The dataset was divided into a derivation and validation cohorts of 4,911 and 2,488 respectively. Clinicians used an 18-point checklist of known risk factors to divide patients into low, medium, or high risk. Their predictive ability was compared with a risk stratification model derived from the {EMR} data. The model was based on the continuation-ratio ordinal regression method coupled with lasso (which stands for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). {RESULTS}: In the year prior to suicide assessment, 66.8\% of patients attended the emergency department ({ED}) and 41.8\% had at least one hospital admission. Administrative and demographic data, along with information on prior self-harm episodes, as well as mental and physical health diagnoses were predictive of high-risk suicidal behaviour. Clinicians using the 18-point checklist were relatively poor in predicting patients at high-risk in 3 months ({AUC} 0.58, 95\% {CIs}: 0.50 - 0.66). The model derived {EMR} was superior ({AUC} 0.79, 95\% {CIs}: 0.72 - 0.84). At specificity of 0.72 (95\% {CIs}: 0.70-0.73) the {EMR} model had sensitivity of 0.70 (95\% {CIs}: 0.56-0.83). {CONCLUSION}: Predictive models applied to data from the {EMR} could improve risk stratification of patients presenting with potential suicidal behaviour. The predictive factors include known risks for suicide, but also other information relating to general health and health service utilisation.},

Model parameters were obtained from published literature, publicly available data sources, and expert input. In the screen-positive scenario, {ABPM} was the dominant strategy among all age and sex groups. Compared with clinic {BP} measurement, {ABPM} was associated with cost-savings ranging from \$77 (women 80 years of age) to \$5013 (women 21 years of age). In the screen-negative scenario, {ABPM} was the dominant strategy in all men and women {\textless}80 years of age with cost-savings ranging from \$128 (women 70 years of age) to \$2794 (women 21 years of age). Sensitivity analyses showed that results were sensitive to test specificity and antihypertensive medication costs. {ABPM} is recommended as the diagnostic strategy of choice for most adults in primary care settings regardless of initial screening results.},

	abstract = {Advances in genomics have led to mounting expectations in regard to their impact on health care and disease prevention. In light of this fact, a comprehensive research agenda is needed to move human genome discoveries into health practice in a way that maximizes health benefits and minimizes harm to individuals and populations. We present a framework for the continuum of multidisciplinary translation research that builds on previous characterization efforts in genomics and other areas in health care and prevention. The continuum includes four phases of translation research that revolve around the development of evidence-based guidelines. Phase 1 translation (T1) research seeks to move a basic genome-based discovery into a candidate health application (e.g., genetic test/intervention). Phase 2 translation (T2) research assesses the value of a genomic application for health practice leading to the development of evidence-based guidelines. Phase 3 translation (T3) research attempts to move evidence-based guidelines into health practice, through delivery, dissemination, and diffusion research. Phase 4 translation (T4) research seeks to evaluate the "real world" health outcomes of a genomic application in practice. Because the development of evidence-based guidelines is a moving target, the types of translation research can overlap and provide feedback loops to allow integration of new knowledge. Although it is difficult to quantify how much of genomics research is T1, we estimate that no more than 3\% of published research focuses on T2 and beyond. Indeed, evidence-based guidelines and T3 and T4 research currently are rare. With continued advances in genomic applications, however, the full continuum of translation research needs adequate support to realize the promise of genomics for human health.},

The participants were classified by their (i) cross-classification according to office and home {BP} (normotension, masked hypertension, white-coat hypertension, and sustained hypertension) and (ii) home {BP} level (normal {BP}, high normal {BP}, grade 1 and 2 hypertension), while the number of home measurement days was increased from 1 to 7. The prognostic accuracy of home {BP} with an increasing number of home {BP} measurement days was also assessed by multivariable-adjusted Cox models. {RESULTS}: Agreement in classification between consecutive measurement days indicated near perfect agreement (kappa {\textgreater}/= 0.9) after the sixth measurement day for both office and home {BP} cross-classification (97.8\% maintained classification, kappa = 0.97) and home {BP} level (93.6\% maintained classification, kappa = 0.91). Over a follow-up of 8.3 years, 568 participants experienced a cardiovascular event, and the first home {BP} measurement alone predicted events significantly (P {\textless}/= 0.003). The confidence intervals ({CIs}) were too wide and overlapping to show superiority of multiple measurement days over the first measurement day (hazard ratios per 10mm Hg increase in systolic {BP} at initial day, 1.11 [{CI} 1.07-1.16]; that at 1-7 days, 1.18 [{CI} 1.12-1.24]). Masked hypertension, but not white-coat hypertension, was associated with increased cardiovascular risk, irrespective of the number of home measurement days. {CONCLUSION}: Even a single home {BP} measurement is a potent predictor of cardiovascular events, whereas seven home measurement days may be needed to reliably diagnose hypertension.},

Information obtained met the standards of {MedWatch}, and each reported case was assessed using the Naranjo probability scale. {RESULTS}: In contrast to previous reports suggesting that fluoroquinolone-associated {PNS} events are mild and short-term, 36 of the 45 cases reported severe events that typically involved multiple organ systems. Although many newer cases are still evolving, symptoms had lasted more than three months in 71\% of cases and more than one year in 58\%. Onset of adverse events was usually rapid, with 15 (33\%) events beginning within 24 hours of initiating treatment, 26 (58\%) within 72 hours, and 38 (84\%) within one week. Sixty courses of fluoroquinolones were prescribed: levofloxacin (n = 33 cases), ciprofloxacin (n = 11), ofloxacin (n = 6), lomefloxacin (n = 1), trovafloxacin (n = 1); in eight cases the same antibiotic was prescribed twice. {CONCLUSIONS}: These cases suggest a possible association between fluoroquinolone antibiotics and severe, long-term adverse effects involving the {PNS} as well as other organ systems. The severity of these cases may reflect a different population than typically reported to drug companies or {MedWatch}, which often originate from healthcare providers. In contrast, Internet Web sites may provide a forum for patients experiencing adverse effects that have not resolved promptly. Further study is warranted. Meanwhile the occurrence of {PNS} symptoms during fluoroquinolone therapy should prompt immediate discontinuation of the agent used.},

Our post-hoc analyses did not consider the randomized treatment strategies, but instead defined exposure time-dependently as aggressive treatment ({\textgreater}/=3 concomitantly used antihypertensive medications) versus conventional treatment ({\textless}/=2 concomitantly used antihypertensive medications). Study outcome was defined as time to first serious cardiovascular event (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or all-cause death). We compared hazard ratio ({HR}) estimates for aggressive vs. conventional treatment from a Marginal Structural Cox Model ({MSCM}) to estimates from a standard Cox model. Both models included exposure to antihypertensive treatment at each follow-up visit, demographics, and baseline cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure. The {MSCM} further adjusted for systolic blood pressure at each follow-up visit, through inverse probability of treatment weights. {RESULTS}: 2,269 (10.1\%) patients experienced a cardiovascular event over a total follow-up of 60,939 person-years. The {HR} for aggressive treatment estimated by the standard Cox model was 0.96 (95\% confidence interval 0.87-1.07). The equivalent {MSCM}, which was able to account for changes in systolic blood pressure during follow-up, estimated a {HR} of 0.81 (95\% {CI} 0.71-0.92). {CONCLUSIONS}: Using a {MSCM}, aggressive treatment was associated with a lower risk for serious cardiovascular outcomes compared to conventional treatment. In contrast, a standard Cox model estimated similar risks for aggressive and conventional treatments. {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: {NCT}00133692.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women and accounts for more than half of their deaths. Women have been underrepresented in most studies of cardiovascular disease. Reduced physical fitness has been shown to increase the risk of death in men. Exercise capacity measured by exercise stress test is an objective measure of physical fitness. The hypothesis that reduced exercise capacity is associated with an increased risk of death was investigated in a cohort of 5721 asymptomatic women who underwent baseline examinations in 1992. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Information collected at baseline included medical and family history, demographic characteristics, physical examination, and symptom-limited stress {ECG}, using the Bruce protocol. Exercise capacity was measured in metabolic equivalents ({MET}). Nonfasting blood was analyzed at baseline. A National Death Index search was performed to identify all-cause death and date of death up to the end of 2000. The mean age of participants at baseline was 52+/-11 years. Framingham Risk Score-adjusted hazards ratios (with 95\% {CI}) of death associated with {MET} levels of {\textless}5, 5 to 8, and {\textgreater}8 were 3.1 (2.0 to 4.7), 1.9 (1.3 to 2.9), and 1.00, respectively. The Framingham Risk Score-adjusted mortality risk decreased by 17\% for every 1-{MET} increase. {CONCLUSIONS}: This is the largest cohort of asymptomatic women studied in this context over the longest period of follow-up. This study confirms that exercise capacity is an independent predictor of death in asymptomatic women, greater than what has been previously established among men. The implications for clinical practice and health care policy are far reaching.},

We hypothesized that treatment with the combination of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitor and a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker would be more effective in reducing the rate of cardiovascular events than treatment with an {ACE} inhibitor plus a thiazide diuretic.{\textbar}In a randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 11,506 patients with hypertension who were at high risk for cardiovascular events to receive treatment with either benazepril plus amlodipine or benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide. The primary end point was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, and coronary revascularization.{\textbar}The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. The trial was terminated early after a mean follow-up of 36 months, when the boundary of the prespecified stopping rule was exceeded. Mean blood pressures after dose adjustment were 131.6/73.3 mm Hg in the benazepril-amlodipine group and 132.5/74.4 mm Hg in the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group. There were 552 primary-outcome events in the benazepril-amlodipine group (9.6\%) and 679 in the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group (11.8\%), representing an absolute risk reduction with benazepril-amlodipine therapy of 2.2\% and a relative risk reduction of 19.6\% (hazard ratio, 0.80, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.72 to 0.90; P{\textless}0.001).

Efforts to assist patients with adherence to medications might improve the benefits of prescribed medications, but also might increase their adverse effects.{\textbar}To update a review summarizing the results of randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) of interventions to help patients follow prescriptions for medications for medical problems, including mental disorders but not addictions.{\textbar}We updated searches of The Cochrane Library, {MEDLINE}, {CINAHL}, {EMBASE}, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts ({IPA}), {PsycINFO} (all via {OVID}) and Sociological Abstracts (via {CSA}) in January 2007 with no language restriction. We also reviewed bibliographies in articles on patient adherence and articles in our personal collections, and contacted authors of relevant original and review articles.{\textbar}Articles were selected if they reported an unconfounded {RCT} of an intervention to improve adherence with prescribed medications, measuring both medication adherence and treatment outcome, with at least 80\% follow-up of each group studied and, for long-term treatments, at least six months follow-up for studies with positive initial findings.{\textbar}Study design features, interventions and controls, and results were extracted by one review author and confirmed by at least one other review author. We extracted adherence rates and their measures of variance for all methods of measuring adherence in each study, and all outcome rates and their measures of variance for each study group, as well as levels of statistical significance for differences between study groups, consulting authors and verifying or correcting analyses as needed. The studies differed widely according to medical condition, patient population, intervention, measures of adherence, and clinical outcomes. Therefore, we did not feel that quantitative analysis was scientifically justified; rather, we conducted a qualitative analysis.{\textbar}For short-term treatments, four of ten interventions reported in nine {RCTs} showed an effect on both adherence and at least one clinical outcome, while one intervention reported in one {RCT} significantly improved patient adherence, but did not enhance the clinical outcome. For long-term treatments, 36 of 81 interventions reported in 69 {RCTs} were associated with improvements in adherence, but only 25 interventions led to improvement in at least one treatment outcome. Almost all of the interventions that were effective for long-term care were complex, including combinations of more convenient care, information, reminders, self-monitoring, reinforcement, counseling, family therapy, psychological therapy, crisis intervention, manual telephone follow-up, and supportive care. Even the most effective interventions did not lead to large improvements in adherence and treatment outcomes.{\textbar}For short-term treatments several quite simple interventions increased adherence and improved patient outcomes, but the effects were inconsistent from study to study with less than half of studies showing benefits. Current methods of improving adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective, so that the full benefits of treatment cannot be realized. High priority should be given to fundamental and applied research concerning innovations to assist patients to follow medication prescriptions for long-term medical disorders.},

Treatment recommendations for resistant hypertension include maximizing diuretic therapy by using chlorthalidone and/or adding an aldosterone antagonist. Additional recommendations include combining antihypertensive agents from different drug classes. This retrospective cohort study describes antihypertensive use in patients with resistant hypertension defined as the concurrent use of ≥4 antihypertensive agents. Claims data from the Medstat {MarketScan} Commercial Claims and Encounter database were used to identify patients with resistant hypertension based on International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification ({ICD}-9-{CM}) diagnosis codes and National Drug Codes between May 1, 2008 and June 30, 2009. Of the 5 442 410 patients with hypertension in the database, 140 126 met study criteria. The most frequently prescribed antihypertensive classes were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (96.2\%), diuretics (93.2\%), calcium channel blockers (83.6\%), and β-blockers (80.0\%). Only 3.0\% and 5.9\% of patients were on chlorthalidone or an aldosterone antagonist, respectively. A total of 15.6\% of patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor plus angiotensin receptor blocker. Our findings demonstrate that frequently prescribed antihypertensive agents for the treatment of resistant hypertension included guideline-recommended first-line agents. However, evidence-based and recommended agents, such as chlorthalidone and aldosterone antagonists, were underused. Moreover, minimally efficacious combinations, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker, were prescribed at higher rates than evidence-based and recommended agents.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: This study was performed to determine whether pulmonary function test results would appreciably alter asthma severity categorization determined by an algorithm using information readily available in administrative databases. {METHODS}: Patients 6 to 64 years of age with asthma diagnosed from 1999-2005, who had at least one pulmonary function test, were identified from a claims database of a medical group practice located in central Massachusetts. Asthma severity for these patients was categorized using information available in an administrative database (claims-based algorithm) and by percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second ({FEV}(1)) or peak expiratory flow ({PEF}) abstracted from medical charts (pulmonary function test method). Gamma rank correlation index was used to measure the association between the two severity categorization methods. Total and asthma-related healthcare costs for each severity category were compared between the two different approaches. {RESULTS}: There was a significant ordinal association between severity categorization with the two classification approaches (p = 0.0002). The pulmonary function test method resulted in more frequent mild categorizations and less frequent moderate and severe categorizations than the claims-based algorithm. In only 10.9\% of patients did the pulmonary function test method result in a more severe asthma category than the claims-based algorithm. Patients with more severe asthma, determined by both methods, had higher total and asthma-related health care costs. Total and asthma-related health care costs were similar for each asthma severity categorization for the two classification approaches, except for asthma-related costs in the moderate severity categories. {CONCLUSION}: The claims-based algorithm generally categorized patients as having more severe asthma than the approach using pulmonary function test results. Pulmonary function test results would have appreciably changed asthma severity categorization in only a small percent of patients. These findings add further support to the use of administrative database analyses for the evaluation of asthma care in large populations.},

Prior {RDN} studies have demonstrated significant and durable reductions in blood pressure. This analysis investigated factors that may help explain these disparate results. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Patients with resistant hypertension were randomized 2 : 1 to {RDN} (n = 364) or sham (n = 171). The primary endpoint was the difference in office systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) change at 6 months. A multivariable analysis identified predictors of {SBP} change. Additional analyses examined the influence of medication changes, results in selected subgroups and procedural factors. Between randomization and the 6-month endpoint, 39\% of patients underwent medication changes. Predictors of office {SBP} reduction at 6 months were baseline office {SBP} {\textgreater}/= 180 {mmHg}, aldosterone antagonist use, and non-use of vasodilators; number of ablations was a predictor in the {RDN} group. Non-African-American patients receiving {RDN} had a significantly greater change in office {SBP} than those receiving sham; -15.2 +/- 23.5 vs. -8.6 +/- 24.8 {mmHg}, respectively (P = 0.012). Greater reductions in office and ambulatory {SBP}, and heart rate were observed with a higher number of ablations and energy delivery in a four-quadrant pattern. {CONCLUSIONS}: Post hoc analyses, although derived from limited patient cohorts, reveal several potential confounding factors that may partially explain the unexpected blood pressure responses in both the sham control and {RDN} groups.

However, a key contemporary question is whether this strategy is optimal in reducing aortic pressure and aortic stiffness, and whether specific treatment strategies might be preferred to reduce the process of arterial aging. This review examines current evidence that {BP}-lowering treatments can differentially affect aortic pressure and stiffness parameters relative to brachial {BP}. There is now unequivocal evidence that different treatment regimens can differentially affect {BP} in the central aorta relative to brachial {BP}, and emerging evidence of {BP}-independent differential drug effects on arterial stiffness. A remaining challenge is to link any potentially favorable changes in aortic pressure and/or stiffness to improvements in morbidity and mortality over and above those expected from conventional {BP} lowering.},

Associations with all-cause mortality were examined in time-dependent Cox models with adjustment for relevant confounders. {RESULTS}: Patients with {SBP} of 130 to 159 mm Hg combined with {DBP} of 70 to 89 mm Hg had the lowest adjusted mortality rates, and those in whom both {SBP} and {DBP} were concomitantly very high or very low had the highest mortality rates. Patients with moderately elevated {SBP} combined with {DBP} no less than 70 mm Hg had consistently lower mortality rates than did patients with ideal {SBP} combined with {DBP} less than 70 mm Hg.

This post hoc analysis examined whether the addition of perindopril to beta-blocker in {EUROPA} had additional benefits on outcomes compared with standard therapy including beta-blocker. {METHODS}: {EUROPA} was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in patients with documented stable {CAD}.

This study aimed to assess whether thiazide use is effective and safe in type 2 diabetic patients with well-controlled {BP} and whether intensive {BP} control leads to decreased risk of cardiovascular events depending on thiazide use. We performed an observational cohort study using data from the {ACCORD} study (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes). The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events ({MACE}), which was a composite end point including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Hazard ratios for primary and secondary outcomes with 95\% {CIs} were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. We included 10 011 type 2 diabetic patients. The overall mean follow-up period was 7.7 years, and 1776 patients experienced {MACE}. Mean systolic {BP} at baseline in patients taking and not taking thiazides was 137.2 and 135.7 mm Hg, respectively. Thiazide use was associated with increased risk of {MACE}, particularly stroke (hazard ratio, 1.49 [95\% {CI}, 1.18-1.88]). In addition, thiazide use was significantly associated with higher risks of {MACE} and stroke in patients receiving intensive {BP} control but not in those receiving standard {BP} control. Similar associations were observed in analyses using propensity score matching. Intensive {BP} control reduced the risks of {MACE} and stroke in patients not taking thiazides but not in patients taking thiazides. Thiazide use may be harmful in type 2 diabetic patients with relatively low {BP}.},

If the {DBP} guiding treatment was above ({\textgreater}89 mm Hg), at (80-89 mm Hg), or below ({\textless}80 mm Hg) target, 1 physician blinded to the patients' randomization intensified antihypertensive treatment, left it unchanged, or reduced it, respectively. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The {CBP} and {ABP} levels, intensity of drug treatment, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic left ventricular mass, symptoms reported by questionnaire, and cost. {RESULTS}: At the end of the study (median follow-up, 182 days; 5th to 95th percentile interval, 85-258 days), more {ABP} than {CBP} patients had stopped antihypertensive drug treatment (26.3\% vs 7.3\%; P{\textless}.001), and fewer {ABP} patients had progressed to sustained multiple-drug treatment (27.2\% vs 42.7\%; P{\textless}.001). The final {CBP} and 24-hour {ABP} averaged 144.1/89.9 mm Hg and 129.4/79.5 mm Hg in the {ABP} group and 140.3/89.6 mm Hg and 128.0/79.1 mm Hg in the {CBP} group. Left ventricular mass and reported symptoms were similar in the 2 groups. The potential savings in the {ABP} group in terms of less intensive drug treatment and fewer physician visits were offset by the costs of {ABP} monitoring. {CONCLUSIONS}: Adjustment of antihypertensive treatment based on {ABP} monitoring instead of {CBP} measurement led to less intensive drug treatment with preservation of blood pressure control, general well-being, and inhibition of left ventricular enlargement but did not reduce the overall costs of antihypertensive treatment.},

	abstract = {Background.: This study investigated whether quinolone ear drops, with or without corticosteroids, increase the risk of perforation requiring tympanoplasty following tympanostomy tube ({TT}) placement in children. Methods.: This was a retrospective cohort study using Medicaid encounter and pharmacy billing data from 29 {US} states between 1999 and 2006. Children {\textless}18 years old without predisposing factors for perforation during a 6-month look-back period entered the cohort after {TT} placement and first dispensing of antibiotic ear drops. Included ear drops were quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin plus hydrocortisone, or ciprofloxacin plus dexamethasone) or neomycin plus hydrocortisone. Children were followed until end of 2006, end of Medicaid enrollment, or occurrence of study outcome. A Cox regression model, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, initial {TT} indication, reinsertion of {TT}, adenoidectomy, and number of ear drop prescriptions was used to compare the rate of perforation between quinolone and neomycin plus hydrocortisone ear drop-exposed children. Perforation was defined by its diagnosis code followed by a tympanoplasty code. Results.: A total of 96595 children entered the study cohort. Patients exposed to quinolone ear drops had a higher risk of perforation, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.61 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.15-2.26). The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.49 (95\% {CI}, 1.05-2.09) for ofloxacin, 1.94 (95\% {CI}, 1.32-2.85) for ciprofloxacin plus hydrocortisone, and 2.00 (95\% {CI}, 1.18-3.41) for ciprofloxacin plus dexamethasone. Conclusions.: Exposure of children with {TT} to quinolone ear drops is associated with increased risk of perforations requiring tympanoplasty, which appears to be further exaggerated by corticosteroids. Clinicians should consider the risk of perforation and counsel patients/families accordingly when prescribing quinolone ear drops.},

Subjects were stratified into subgroups based on the presence of high-risk conditions or characteristics described by the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in their seventh report as "compelling indications" (eg, diabetes) or "special situations" (eg, obesity). Blood pressure control was examined in terms of goal attainment and reductions in blood pressure using last available readings at days 90, 180, and 360, following therapy initiation. {RESULTS}: Among the 10,345 study subjects, 47\% had compelling indications and 39\% had special situations. In the former group, 62\% (95\% {CI} 61 to 64) of patients with Stage 1 hypertension (140-159/90-99 mm Hg) attained blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg by day 360; among those with Stage 2 hypertension ({\textgreater} or =160/100 mm Hg), the corresponding figure was 48\% (95\% {CI} 46 to 50).

Among those without high-risk conditions, these percentages were 63\% (95\% {CI} 59 to 67) and 55\% (95\% {CI} 52 to 59). Among patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, 25\% (95\% {CI} 24 to 26) attained blood pressure less than 130/80 mm Hg by day 360. {CONCLUSIONS}: Many patients starting antihypertensive therapy in clinical practice fail to achieve blood pressure control within the first year.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ({ACE} inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers ({ARBs}) are widely prescribed for primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure {\textgreater} 140 {mmHg} or diastolic blood pressure {\textgreater} 90 {mmHg}). However, while {ACE} inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in placebo-controlled trials, {ARBs} have not. Therefore, a comparison of the efficacies of these two drug classes in primary hypertension for preventing total mortality and cardiovascular events is important. {OBJECTIVES}: To compare the effects of {ACE} inhibitors and {ARBs} on total mortality and cardiovascular events, and their rates of withdrawals due to adverse effects ({WDAEs}), in people with primary hypertension. {SEARCH} {METHODS}: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ({CENTRAL}), {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, the World Health Organization ({WHO}) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the {ISI} Web of Science up to July 2014. We contacted study authors for missing and unpublished information, and also searched the reference lists of relevant reviews for eligible studies. {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: We included randomized controlled trials enrolling people with uncontrolled or controlled primary hypertension with or without other risk factors. Included trials must have compared an {ACE} inhibitor and an {ARB} in a head-to-head manner, and lasted for a duration of at least one year. If background blood pressure lowering agents were continued or added during the study, the protocol to do so must have been the same in both study arms. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Nine studies with 11,007 participants were included. Of the included studies, five reported data on total mortality, three reported data on total cardiovascular events, and four reported data on cardiovascular mortality. No study separately reported cardiovascular morbidity. In contrast, eight studies contributed data on {WDAE}. Included studies were of good to moderate quality. There was no evidence of a difference between {ACE} inhibitors and {ARBs} for total mortality (risk ratio ({RR}) 0.98; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.88 to 1.10), total cardiovascular events ({RR} 1.07; 95\% {CI} 0.96 to 1.19), or cardiovascular mortality ({RR} 0.98; 95\% {CI} 0.85 to 1.13). Conversely, a high level of evidence indicated a slightly lower incidence of {WDAE} for {ARBs} as compared with {ACE} inhibitors ({RR} 0.83; 95\% {CI} 0.74 to 0.93; absolute risk reduction ({ARR}) 1.8\%, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome ({NNTB}) 55 over 4.1 years), mainly attributable to a higher incidence of dry cough with {ACE} inhibitors. The quality of the evidence for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes was limited by possible publication bias, in that several studies were initially eligible for inclusion in this review, but had no extractable data available for the hypertension subgroup. To this end, the evidence for total mortality was judged to be moderate, while the evidence for total cardiovascular events was judged to be low by the {GRADE} approach. {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Our analyses found no evidence of a difference in total mortality or cardiovascular outcomes for {ARBs} as compared with {ACE} inhibitors, while {ARBs} caused slightly fewer {WDAEs} than {ACE} inhibitors. Although {ACE} inhibitors have shown efficacy in these outcomes over placebo, our results cannot be used to extrapolate the same conclusion for {ARBs} directly, which have not been studied in placebo-controlled trials for hypertension. Thus, the substitution of an {ARB} for an {ACE} inhibitor, while supported by evidence on grounds of tolerability, must be made in consideration of the weaker evidence for the efficacy of {ARBs} regarding mortality and morbidity outcomes compared with {ACE} inhibitors. Additionally, our data mostly derives from participants with existing clinical sequelae of hypertension, and it would be useful to have data from asymptomatic people to increase the generalizability of this review. Unpublished subgroup data of hypertensive participants in existing trials comparing {ACE} inhibitors and {ARBs} needs to be made available for this purpose.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This report presents estimates for the period 2001-2008 of means and selected percentiles of systolic and diastolic blood pressure by sex, race or ethnicity, age, and hypertension status in adults aged 18 and over. {METHODS}: Demographic characteristics were collected during a personal interview, and blood pressures were measured during a physician examination. All estimates were calculated using the mean of up to three measurements. The final analytic sample consisted of 19,921 adults aged 18 and over with complete data. Examined sample weights and sample design variables were used to calculate nationally representative estimates and standard error estimates that account for the complex design, using {SAS} and {SUDAAN} statistical software. {RESULTS}: Mean systolic blood pressure was 122 mm Hg for all adults aged 18 and over; it was 116 mm Hg for normotensive adults, 130 mm Hg for treated hypertensive adults, and 146 mm Hg for untreated hypertensive adults. Mean diastolic blood pressure was 71 mm Hg for all adults 18 and over; it was 69 mm Hg for normotensive adults, 75 mm Hg for treated hypertensive adults, and 85 mm Hg for untreated hypertensive adults. There was a trend of increasing systolic blood pressure with increasing age. A more curvilinear trend was seen in diastolic blood pressure, with increasing then decreasing means with age in both men and women. Men had higher mean systolic and diastolic pressures than women. There were some differences in mean blood pressure by race or ethnicity, with non-Hispanic black adults having higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures than non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American adults, but these differences were not consistent after stratification by hypertension status and sex. {CONCLUSIONS}: These estimates of the distribution of blood pressure may be useful for policy makers who are considering ways to achieve a downward shift in the population distribution of blood pressure with the goal of reducing morbidity and mortality related to hypertension.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The interest in prognostic reviews is increasing, but to properly review existing evidence an accurate search filer for finding prediction research is needed. The aim of this paper was to validate and update two previously introduced search filters for finding prediction research in Medline: the Ingui filter and the Haynes Broad filter. {METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: Based on a hand search of 6 general journals in 2008 we constructed two sets of papers. Set 1 consisted of prediction research papers (n = 71), and set 2 consisted of the remaining papers (n = 1133). Both search filters were validated in two ways, using diagnostic accuracy measures as performance measures. First, we compared studies in set 1 (reference) with studies retrieved by the search strategies as applied in Medline. Second, we compared studies from 4 published systematic reviews (reference) with studies retrieved by the search filter as applied in Medline. Next--using word frequency methods--we constructed an additional search string for finding prediction research. Both search filters were good in identifying clinical prediction models: sensitivity ranged from 0.94 to 1.0 using our hand search as reference, and 0.78 to 0.89 using the systematic reviews as reference. This latter performance measure even increased to around 0.95 (range 0.90 to 0.97) when either search filter was combined with the additional string that we developed. Retrieval rate of explorative prediction research was poor, both using our hand search or our systematic review as reference, and even combined with our additional search string: sensitivity ranged from 0.44 to 0.85. {CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: Explorative prediction research is difficult to find in Medline, using any of the currently available search filters. Yet, application of either the Ingui filter or the Haynes broad filter results in a very low number missed clinical prediction model studies.},

The trials were conducted at medical clinics in the {US} and Canada in patients with a mean office diastolic blood pressure ({BP}) of 95 to 115 mm Hg on 2 consecutive weeks and a mean daytime diastolic {BP} {\textgreater}90 mm Hg.

Bibliographies of review articles and personal files were also searched. {TRIAL} {SELECTION}:- Trials that had randomized allocation to control and dietary sodium intervention groups, monitored by timed sodium excretion, with outcome measures of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were selected by blinded review of the methods section.{\textbar}- Two observers extracted data independently, using purpose-designed forms, and discrepancies were resolved by discussion.{\textbar}- The 56 trials that met our inclusion criteria showed significant heterogeneity. Publication bias was also evident. The mean reduction (95\% confidence interval) in daily urinary sodium excretion, a proxy measure of dietary sodium intake, was 95 mmol/d (71-119 mmol/d) in 28 trials with 1131 hypertensive subjects and 125 mmol/d (95-156 mmol/d) in 28 trials with 2374 normotensive subjects. After adjustment for measurement error of urinary sodium excretion, the decrease in blood pressure for a 100-mmol/d reduction in daily sodium excretion was 3.7 mm Hg (2.35-5.05 mm Hg) for systolic (P{\textless}.001) and 0.9 mm Hg (-0.13 to 1.85 mm Hg) for diastolic (P=.09) in the hypertensive trials, and 1.0 mm Hg (0.51-1.56 mm Hg) for systolic (P{\textless}.001) and 0.1 mm Hg (-0.32 to 0.51 mm Hg) for diastolic (P=.64) in the normotensive trials. Decreases in blood pressure were larger in trials of older hypertensive individuals and small and nonsignificant in trials of normotensive individuals whose meals were prepared and who lived outside the institutional setting.{\textbar}- Dietary sodium restriction for older hypertensive individuals might be considered, but the evidence in the normotensive population does not support current recommendations for universal dietary sodium restriction.},

In 11 refractory hypertensive patients with {OSA}, the acute effects of {CPAP} on nocturnal {BP} were studied during sleep and its longer term effects on 24-h ambulatory {BP} after 2 months. During a single night's application, {CPAP} abolished {OSA} and reduced systolic {BP} in stage 2 sleep from 138.3 +/- 6.8 to 126.0 +/- 6.3 {mmHg}. There was also a trend towards a reduction in average diastolic {BP} (from 77.7 +/- 4.5 to 72.9 +/- 4.5). {CPAP} usage for 2 months was accompanied by an 11.0 +/- 4.4 {mmHg} reduction in 24-h systolic {BP}. In addition, both the nocturnal and daytime components of systolic {BP} fell significantly by 14.4 +/- 4.4 and 9.3 +/- 3.9 {mmHg}, respectively.

Often, investigators create and iteratively refine phenotype algorithms to achieve high positive predictive values ({PPVs}) or sensitivity, thereby identifying valid cases and controls. These algorithms achieve the greatest utility when validated and shared by multiple health care systems.Materials and Methods We report the current status and impact of the Phenotype {KnowledgeBase} ({PheKB}, http://phekb.org), an online environment supporting the workflow of building, sharing, and validating electronic phenotype algorithms. We analyze the most frequent components used in algorithms and their performance at authoring institutions and secondary implementation sites. {RESULTS}: As of June 2015, {PheKB} contained 30 finalized phenotype algorithms and 62 algorithms in development spanning a range of traits and diseases. Phenotypes have had over 3500 unique views in a 6-month period and have been reused by other institutions. International Classification of Disease codes were the most frequently used component, followed by medications and natural language processing. Among algorithms with published performance data, the median {PPV} was nearly identical when evaluated at the authoring institutions (n = 44; case 96.0\%, control 100\%) compared to implementation sites (n = 40; case 97.5\%, control 100\%). {DISCUSSION}: These results demonstrate that a broad range of algorithms to mine electronic health record data from different health systems can be developed with high {PPV}, and algorithms developed at one site are generally transportable to others. {CONCLUSION}: By providing a central repository, {PheKB} enables improved development, transportability, and validity of algorithms for research-grade phenotypes using health care generated data.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: This study sought to develop a predictive model for 30-day mortality in hospitalized cancer patients, by using admission information available through the electronic medical record. {METHODS}: Observational cohort study of 3062 patients admitted to the oncology service from August 1, 2008, to July 31, 2009. Matched numbers of patients were in the derivation and validation cohorts (1531 patients). Data were obtained on day 1 of admission and included demographic information, vital signs, and laboratory data. Survival data were obtained from the Social Security Death Index. {RESULTS}: The 30-day mortality rate of the derivation and validation samples were 9.5\% and 9.7\% respectively. Significant predictive variables in the multivariate analysis included age (P {\textless} .0001), assistance with activities of daily living ({ADLs}; P = .022), admission type (elective/emergency) (P = .059), oxygen use (P {\textless} .0001), and vital signs abnormalities including pulse oximetry (P = .0004), temperature (P = .017), and heart rate (P = .0002). A logistic regression model was developed to predict death within 30 days: Score = 18.2897 + 0.6013*(admit type) + 0.4518*({ADL}) + 0.0325*(admit age) - 0.1458*(temperature) + 0.019*(heart rate) - 0.0983*(pulse oximetry) - 0.0123 (systolic blood pressure) + 0.8615*(O2 use). The largest sum of sensitivity (63\%) and specificity (78\%) was at -2.09 (area under the curve = -0.789). A total of 25.32\% (100 of 395) of patients with a score above -2.09 died, whereas 4.31\% (49 of 1136) of patients below -2.09 died. Sensitivity and positive predictive value in the derivation and validation samples compared favorably. {CONCLUSIONS}: Clinical factors available via the electronic medical record within 24 hours of hospital admission can be used to identify cancer patients at risk for 30-day mortality. These patients would benefit from discussion of preferences for care at the end of life.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The metabolic syndrome ({MetS}) is typically diagnosed based on abnormalities in specific clustered clinical measures that are associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease ({CHD}) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, current {MetS} criteria result in racial/ethnic discrepancies. Our goals were to use confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) to delineate differential contributions to {MetS} by sub-group, and if contributions were discovered, develop sex and racial/ethnic-specific equations to calculate {MetS} severity. {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: Using data on adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2010, we performed a {CFA} of a single {MetS} factor that allowed differential loadings across groups, resulting in a sex and race/ethnicity-specific continuous {MetS} severity score. {RESULTS}: Loadings to the single {MetS} factor differed by sub-group for each {MetS} component (p{\textless}0.001), with lower factor loadings among non-Hispanic-blacks for triglycerides and among Hispanics for waist circumference. Systolic blood pressure exhibited low factor loadings among all groups. {MetS} severity scores were correlated with biomarkers of future disease (high-sensitivity C-reactive-protein, uric acid, insulin resistance). Non-Hispanic-black-males with diabetics had a low prevalence of {MetS} but high {MetS} severity scores that were not significantly different from other racial/ethnic groups. {CONCLUSIONS}: This analysis among adults uniquely demonstrated differences between sexes and racial/ethnic groups regarding contributions of traditional {MetS} components to an assumed single factor. The resulting equations provide a clinically-accessible and interpretable continuous measure of {MetS} for potential use in identifying adults at higher risk for {MetS}-related diseases and following changes within individuals over time. These equations hold potential to be a powerful new outcome for use in {MetS}-focused research and interventions.},

	abstract = {Recent clinical trials demonstrating that hormone replacement therapy ({HRT}) does not prevent coronary heart disease in women have again raised doubts concerning observational studies. Although much of the explanation probably lies in what might be called the "healthy {HRT} user" effect, another contributing factor may be that most observational studies included many prevalent users: women taking {HRT} for some time before study follow-up began. This practice can cause two types of bias, both of which plausibly may have contributed to the discrepancy between observational and randomized studies. First, prevalent users are "survivors" of the early period of pharmacotherapy, which can introduce substantial bias if risk varies with time, just as in studies of operative procedures that enroll patients after they have survived surgery. This article provides several examples of medications for which the hazard function varies with time and thus would be subject to prevalent user bias. Second, covariates for drug users at study entry often are plausibly affected by the drug itself. Investigators often do not adjust for these factors on the causal pathway, which may introduce confounding. A new-user design eliminates these biases by restricting the analysis to persons under observation at the start of the current course of treatment. This article thus argues that such designs should be used more frequently in pharmacoepidemiology.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Vascular calcification is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in stage V chronic kidney disease, yet its early pathogenesis and initiating mechanisms in vivo remain poorly understood. To address this, we quantified the calcium (Ca) load in arteries from children (10 predialysis, 24 dialysis) and correlated it with clinical, biochemical, and vascular measures. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Vessel Ca load was significantly elevated in both predialysis and dialysis and was correlated with the patients' mean serum Ca x phosphate product. However, only dialysis patients showed increased carotid intima-media thickness and increased aortic stiffness, and calcification on computed tomography was present in only the 2 patients with the highest Ca loads. Importantly, predialysis vessels appeared histologically intact, whereas dialysis vessels exhibited evidence of extensive vascular smooth muscle cell ({VSMC}) loss owing to apoptosis. Dialysis vessels also showed increased alkaline phosphatase activity and Runx2 and osterix expression, indicative of {VSMC} osteogenic transformation. Deposition of the vesicle membrane marker annexin {VI} and vesicle component mineralization inhibitors fetuin-A and matrix Gla-protein increased in dialysis vessels and preceded von Kossa positive overt calcification. Electron microscopy showed hydroxyapatite nanocrystals within vesicles released from damaged/dead {VSMCs}, indicative of their role in initiating calcification. {CONCLUSIONS}: Taken together, this study shows that Ca accumulation begins predialysis, but it is the induction of {VSMC} apoptosis in dialysis that is the key event in disabling {VSMC} defense mechanisms and leading to overt calcification, eventually with clinically detectable vascular damage. Thus the identification of factors that lead to {VSMC} death in dialysis will be of prime importance in preventing vascular calcification.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({AECOPD}) is a leading cause of hospitalization and death. We sought to develop and validate a mortality risk-adjustment model to enhance hospital performance measurement and to support comparative effectiveness research. {METHODS}: Using a derivation cohort of 69,299 {AECOPD} admissions in 2005-2006 across 172 hospitals, we developed a logistic regression model with age, sex, laboratory results, vital signs, and secondary diagnosis-based comorbidities as covariates. We converted the model coefficients into a score system and validated it using 33,327 admissions from 2007. We used the c-statistic to assess model fit. {RESULTS}: In the derivation and validation cohorts, the median (interquartile range) age was 72 (range, 63-79) versus 71 (range, 62-79) years; 45.6\% versus 45.9\% were male; and in-hospital mortality rates were 3.2\% versus 2.9\%, respectively. The predicted probability of deaths for individuals ranged from 0.004 to 0.942 versus 0.001 to 0.933, respectively. The relative contribution of variables to the predictive ability of the derivation model was age (18.3\%), admission laboratory results (39.9\%), vital signs (14.7\%), altered mental status (7.1\%), and comorbidities (19.9\%). The model c-statistic was 0.83 (95\% {CI}: 0.82, 0.84) versus 0.84 (95\% {CI}: 0.83, 0.85), respectively, with good calibration for both cohorts. {CONCLUSIONS}: A mortality prediction model combining clinical and administrative data that can be obtained from electronic health records demonstrated good discrimination among patients hospitalized for {AECOPD}. The addition of admission vital signs and laboratory results enhanced clinical validity and could be applied to future comparative effectiveness research and hospital profiling efforts.},

An increased risk for cardiovascular events is associated with {rHTN} compared with controlled hypertension ({HTN}). The purpose of this study was to assess the emotional impact of {rHTN} on patients compared with the impact of uncontrolled hypertension ({uHTN}). {METHODS}: We conducted an online survey in an international cohort of 2649 patients with {uHTN} and 1925 patients with {rHTN}. Adults self-reported as having {uHTN} or {rHTN} in eight countries (Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States) responded to a series of questions about their perceptions regarding the impact of {HTN} on their lives. The raw data were weighted by demographic variables, the propensity for respondents to be online (except data from Brazil and Japan), and the relative population of each country surveyed. {RESULTS}: Respondents from both groups reported a substantial emotional impact from {HTN}. People with {rHTN} reported consistently greater impact than patients with {uHTN}, including a poorer perception of their overall health, greater degree of concern over their elevated {BP}, and a greater impact on their everyday lives. {CONCLUSION}: In addition to the known risks to physical health, {rHTN} presents a substantial emotional burden to patients. An awareness of the emotional consequences of {rHTN} may help healthcare providers to communicate more effectively with their patients and, ultimately, to provide better care.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Despite gender-neutral guidelines, prior studies suggest that women have lower rates of hypertension control and these differences may vary with age. Accordingly, we compared rates of hypertension control between women and men as a function of age. {METHODS}: Within three integrated healthcare systems in the Cardiovascular Research Network, we studied all patients seen from 2001 to 2007 with incident hypertension. Within 1 year of cohort entry, patient's hypertension was categorized as controlled based upon achieving guideline-recommended blood pressure levels, recognized if hypertension was diagnosed or a hypertension medication dispensed, and treated based on hypertension medications dispensed. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed the association between gender and 1-year hypertension outcomes, adjusted for patient characteristics. {RESULTS}: Among the 152,561 patients with incident hypertension, 55.6\% were women. Compared to men, women were older, had more kidney disease and more blood pressure measures during follow-up. Overall, men tended to have lower rates of hypertension control compared to women (41.2 vs. 45.7\%, adjusted odds ratio 0.93, 95\% confidence interval 0.91-0.95). A significant gender by age interaction was found with men aged 18-49 having 17\% lower odds of hypertension control and men aged at least 65 having 12\% higher odds of hypertension control compared to women of similar ages (P{\textless}0.001). {CONCLUSION}: In this incident hypertension cohort, younger men and older women had lower rates of hypertension control compared to similarly aged peers. Future studies should investigate why gender differences vary by age in order to plan appropriate means of improving hypertension management regardless of gender or age.},

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Analysis was performed stratifying trials into reperfusion-era ({\textgreater} 50\% undergoing reperfusion or receiving aspirin/statin) or pre-reperfusion-era trials. {RESULTS}: Sixty trials with 102,003 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. In the acute myocardial infarction trials, a significant interaction (Pinteraction = .02) was noted such that beta-blockers reduced mortality in the pre-reperfusion (incident rate ratio [{IRR}] 0.86; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.79-0.94) but not in the reperfusion era ({IRR} 0.98; 95\% {CI}, 0.92-1.05). In the pre-reperfusion era, beta-blockers reduced cardiovascular mortality ({IRR} 0.87; 95\% {CI}, 0.78-0.98), myocardial infarction ({IRR} 0.78; 95\% {CI}, 0.62-0.97), and angina ({IRR} 0.88; 95\% {CI}, 0.82-0.95), with no difference for other outcomes. In the reperfusion era, beta-blockers reduced myocardial infarction ({IRR} 0.72; 95\% {CI}, 0.62-0.83) (number needed to treat to benefit [{NNTB}] = 209) and angina ({IRR} 0.80; 95\% {CI}, 0.65-0.98) ({NNTB} = 26) at the expense of increase in heart failure ({IRR} 1.10; 95\% {CI}, 1.05-1.16) (number needed to treat to harm [{NNTH}] = 79), cardiogenic shock ({IRR} 1.29; 95\% {CI}, 1.18-1.41) ({NNTH} = 90), and drug discontinuation ({IRR} 1.64; 95\% {CI}, 1.55-1.73), with no benefit for other outcomes. Benefits for recurrent myocardial infarction and angina in the reperfusion era appeared to be short term (30 days). {CONCLUSIONS}: In contemporary practice of treatment of myocardial infarction, beta-blockers have no mortality benefit but reduce recurrent myocardial infarction and angina (short-term) at the expense of increase in heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and drug discontinuation.

Recruitment was between March 1, 1985, and January 15, 1988. After the end of a 4.5-year randomized phase of the {SHEP} trial, all participants were advised to receive active therapy. The time interval between the beginning of recruitment and the ascertainment of death by National Death Index (December 31, 2006) was approximately 22 years (21 years 10 months). {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality. {RESULTS}: At the 22-year follow-up, life expectancy gain, expressed as the area between active (n = 2365) and placebo (n = 2371) survival curves, was 105 days (95\% {CI}, -39 to 242; P = .07) for all-cause mortality and 158 days (95\% {CI}, 36-287; P = .009) for cardiovascular death.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. {METHODS}: For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure. {FINDINGS}: We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19.1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127.0 mm Hg (95\% credible interval 125.7-128.3) in men and 122.3 mm Hg (121.0-123.6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78.7 mm Hg (77.9-79.5) for men and 76.7 mm Hg (75.9-77.6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24.1\% (21.4-27.1) in men and 20.1\% (17.8-22.5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1.13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specific prevalence. {INTERPRETATION}: During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe. {FUNDING}: Wellcome Trust.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke and ischaemic heart disease. Most hypertension is detected opportunistically by general practitioners. Those who rarely use medical services are less likely to have their blood pressure ({BP}) measured. We hypothesized that open access self-reading {BP} measurement would detect previously unrecognized hypertension. {METHODS}: Self-reading sphygmomanometers were placed at 13 public sites in Exeter, Devon, United Kingdom. Machine use was determined by users completing a proforma and by direct observation of sites. Users whose {BP} reading was above an action level of 135/85 {mmHg} were asked to attend their general practice. General practitioner records were reviewed 6 months after machine use to identify diagnoses of hypertension. A random sample of users was interviewed, and local general practices were asked about effects on their workload. {RESULTS}: A total of 758 first time users completed a proforma fully, although direct observations suggested total use was much higher. Of the total, 221 (29.2 per cent) readings were above the action level. Eleven new hypertensives were found, 1.4 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval ({CI} 0.7-2.5) of the total users. User acceptability was high. All general practice replies were supportive. {CONCLUSION}: Open access sphygmomanometry for detection of hypertension is feasible. This scheme led to the diagnosis of hypertension in 1.4 per cent of users, and allowed many people to measure their {BP} in a way convenient to them. Before recommending wider implementation we suggest a study examining if our results are transferable to other settings, and if this approach reduces inequalities and is cost-effective.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Whether the treatment of patients with hypertension who are 80 years of age or older is beneficial is unclear. It has been suggested that antihypertensive therapy may reduce the risk of stroke, despite possibly increasing the risk of death. {METHODS}: We randomly assigned 3845 patients from Europe, China, Australasia, and Tunisia who were 80 years of age or older and had a sustained systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or more to receive either the diuretic indapamide (sustained release, 1.5 mg) or matching placebo. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor perindopril (2 or 4 mg), or matching placebo, was added if necessary to achieve the target blood pressure of 150/80 mm Hg. The primary end point was fatal or nonfatal stroke. {RESULTS}: The active-treatment group (1933 patients) and the placebo group (1912 patients) were well matched (mean age, 83.6 years; mean blood pressure while sitting, 173.0/90.8 mm Hg); 11.8\% had a history of cardiovascular disease. Median follow-up was 1.8 years. At 2 years, the mean blood pressure while sitting was 15.0/6.1 mm Hg lower in the active-treatment group than in the placebo group. In an intention-to-treat analysis, active treatment was associated with a 30\% reduction in the rate of fatal or nonfatal stroke (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], -1 to 51; P=0.06), a 39\% reduction in the rate of death from stroke (95\% {CI}, 1 to 62; P=0.05), a 21\% reduction in the rate of death from any cause (95\% {CI}, 4 to 35; P=0.02), a 23\% reduction in the rate of death from cardiovascular causes (95\% {CI}, -1 to 40; P=0.06), and a 64\% reduction in the rate of heart failure (95\% {CI}, 42 to 78; P{\textless}0.001). Fewer serious adverse events were reported in the active-treatment group (358, vs. 448 in the placebo group; P=0.001). {CONCLUSIONS}: The results provide evidence that antihypertensive treatment with indapamide (sustained release), with or without perindopril, in persons 80 years of age or older is beneficial.

The early clinical evolution of a cardiac surgery patient might be predictive for his {LOS}. The purpose of the present study was to develop a predictive model for {ICU} discharge after non-emergency cardiac surgery, by analyzing the first 4 hours of data in the computerized medical record of these patients with Gaussian processes ({GP}), a machine learning technique. {METHODS}: Non-interventional study. Predictive modeling, separate development (n = 461) and validation (n = 499) cohort. {GP} models were developed to predict the probability of {ICU} discharge the day after surgery (classification task), and to predict the day of {ICU} discharge as a discrete variable (regression task). {GP} predictions were compared with predictions by {EuroSCORE}, nurses and physicians. The classification task was evaluated using {aROC} for discrimination, and Brier Score, Brier Score Scaled, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test for calibration. The regression task was evaluated by comparing median actual and predicted discharge, loss penalty function ({LPF}) ((actual-predicted)/actual) and calculating root mean squared relative errors ({RMSRE}). {RESULTS}: Median (P25-P75) {ICU} length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. For classification, the {GP} model showed an {aROC} of 0.758 which was significantly higher than the predictions by nurses, but not better than {EuroSCORE} and physicians. The {GP} had the best calibration, with a Brier Score of 0.179 and Hosmer-Lemeshow p-value of 0.382. For regression, {GP} had the highest proportion of patients with a correctly predicted day of discharge (40\%), which was significantly better than the {EuroSCORE} (p {\textless} 0.001) and nurses (p = 0.044) but equivalent to physicians. {GP} had the lowest {RMSRE} (0.408) of all predictive models. {CONCLUSIONS}: A {GP} model that uses {PDMS} data of the first 4 hours after admission in the {ICU} of scheduled adult cardiac surgery patients was able to predict discharge from the {ICU} as a classification as well as a regression task. The {GP} model demonstrated a significantly better discriminative power than the {EuroSCORE} and the {ICU} nurses, and at least as good as predictions done by {ICU} physicians.

	abstract = {The ability to predict psychiatric readmission would facilitate the development of interventions to reduce this risk, a major driver of psychiatric health-care costs. The symptoms or characteristics of illness course necessary to develop reliable predictors are not available in coded billing data, but may be present in narrative electronic health record ({EHR}) discharge summaries. We identified a cohort of individuals admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit between 1994 and 2012 with a principal diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and extracted inpatient psychiatric discharge narrative notes. Using these data, we trained a 75-topic Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA}) model, a form of natural language processing, which identifies groups of words associated with topics discussed in a document collection. The cohort was randomly split to derive a training (70\%) and testing (30\%) data set, and we trained separate support vector machine models for baseline clinical features alone, baseline features plus common individual words and the above plus topics identified from the 75-topic {LDA} model. Of 4687 patients with inpatient discharge summaries, 470 were readmitted within 30 days. The 75-topic {LDA} model included topics linked to psychiatric symptoms (suicide, severe depression, anxiety, trauma, eating/weight and panic) and major depressive disorder comorbidities (infection, postpartum, brain tumor, diarrhea and pulmonary disease). By including {LDA} topics, prediction of readmission, as measured by area under receiver-operating characteristic curves in the testing data set, was improved from baseline (area under the curve 0.618) to baseline+1000 words (0.682) to baseline+75 topics (0.784). Inclusion of topics derived from narrative notes allows more accurate discrimination of individuals at high risk for psychiatric readmission in this cohort. Topic modeling and related approaches offer the potential to improve prediction using {EHRs}, if generalizability can be established in other clinical cohorts.},

	abstract = {The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that elevate arterial pressure differ according to the patient's age, adipose body mass, and race. However, these mechanisms represent the extremes of a continuum, and overlap among them can be encountered in some patients. A few simple clinical clues allow the physician to identify whether an increase in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, or both is the predominant mechanism in a given patient. Antihypertensive therapy should be aimed not only at lowering arterial pressure but also, more importantly, at ameliorating the concomitant pathophysiologic abnormality. A beta-adrenoreceptor blocker is the initial drug of choice in young patients with "cardiogenic hypertension." In middle-aged patients, cardiac output is usually normal and elevated total peripheral resistance becomes the hemodynamic culprit. In these patients, an angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitor, antiadrenergic drug, or calcium channel blocker should be given to lower total peripheral resistance without affecting cardiac output. In elderly patients, the burden on the heart should be lessened by use of an agent that lowers preload and afterload, such as an {ACE} inhibitor or certain of the calcium blockers. In obese patients in whom intravascular volume is expanded and in most black patients, the initial antihypertensive agent of choice remains a thiazide diuretic unless left ventricular hypertrophy is present.},

	abstract = {Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure ({BP}) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a {BP} goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a {BP} of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease ({CKD}) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with {CKD} to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high {BP} and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Many studies use medical record review for ascertaining outcomes. One large, longitudinal study, the Women's Health Initiative ({WHI}), ascertains strokes using participant self-report and subsequent physician review of medical records. This is resource-intensive. Herein, we assess whether Medicare data can reliably assess stroke events in the {WHI}. {METHODS}: Subjects were {WHI} participants with fee-for-service Medicare. Four stroke definitions were created for Medicare data using discharge diagnoses in hospitalization claims: definition 1, stroke codes in any position; definition 2, primary position stroke codes; and definitions 3 and 4, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke codes, respectively. {WHI} data were randomly split into training (50\%) and test sets. A concordance matrix was used to examine the agreement between {WHI} and Medicare stroke diagnosis. A {WHI} stroke and a Medicare stroke were considered a match if they occurred within +/-7 days of each other. Refined analyses excluded Medicare events when medical records were unavailable for comparison. {RESULTS}: Training data consisted of 24 428 randomly selected participants. There were 577 {WHI} strokes and 557 Medicare strokes using definition 1. Of these, 478 were a match. With regard to algorithm performance, specificity was 99.7\%, negative predictive value was 99.7\%, sensitivity was 82.8\%, positive predictive value was 85.8\%, and kappa=0.84. Performance was similar for test data. Whereas specificity and negative predictive value exceeded 99\%, sensitivity ranged from 75\% to 88\% and positive predictive value ranged from 80\% to 90\% across stroke definitions. {CONCLUSIONS}: Medicare data seem useful for population-based stroke research; however, performance characteristics depend on the definition selected.},

Results showed that blood pressure control was significantly improved in the study group. Compliance rates as well as energy/fatigue scores (a quality-of-life scale) improved in the study group compared with the control population. Community pharmacists in chain stores could have a beneficial effect on the health care of large numbers of patients if pharmaceutical care programs were developed.},

A total of 11,100 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension treated by primary care physicians were enrolled in this 8-week, open-label study. Ramipril was usually initiated at a dosage of 2.5 mg once daily and titrated to achieve target blood pressure. Efficacy was assessed in 8261 patients for whom blood pressure data were recorded after the start of treatment: safety was assessed in all patients. Of patients with combined systolic and diastolic hypertension, 86.0\% achieved a final diastolic blood pressure of {\textless} or = 90 mm Hg or a {\textgreater} or = 10 mm Hg decrease from baseline; the highest response was seen in elderly patients (87.2\%), and the lowest response was seen in black patients (81.2\%). Of patients with isolated systolic hypertension, 70.4\% achieved a final systolic blood pressure of {\textless} or = 140 mm Hg or a {\textgreater} or = 20 mm Hg decrease from baseline, including 70.6\% of women, 70.3\% of men, and 69.1\% of elderly patients; the highest response was seen in white patients (71.8\%), and the lowest response was seen in black patients (64.4\%). Adverse events were generally mild; cough (3.0\%) was the most frequent. Once-daily ramipril was effective and well tolerated during an 8-week period in a large, diverse population of patients who had mild-to-moderate hypertension and who were treated by primary care physicians.},

Phenogroup 1 (n = 1,214) exhibited younger age, higher prevalence of smoking, preserved functional class, and the least evidence of left ventricular ({LV}) hypertrophy and arterial stiffness. Phenogroup 2 (n = 1,329) was older, with normotrophic concentric {LV} remodeling, atrial fibrillation, left atrial enlargement, large-artery stiffening, and biomarkers of innate immunity and vascular calcification. Phenogroup 3 (n = 899) demonstrated more functional impairment, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, concentric {LV} hypertrophy, high renin, and biomarkers of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-mediated inflammation, liver fibrosis, and tissue remodeling. Compared with phenogroup 1, phenogroup 3 exhibited the highest risk of the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, or aborted cardiac arrest (hazard ratio [{HR}]: 3.44; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 2.79 to 4.24); phenogroups 2 and 3 demonstrated similar all-cause mortality (phenotype 2 {HR}: 2.36; 95\% {CI}: 1.89 to 2.95; phenotype 3 {HR}: 2.26, 95\% {CI}: 1.77 to 2.87). Spironolactone randomized therapy was associated with a more pronounced reduction in the risk of the primary endpoint in phenogroup 3 ({HR}: 0.75; 95\% {CI}: 0.59 to 0.95; p for interaction = 0.016). Results were similar after excluding participants from Eastern Europe. {CONCLUSIONS}: We identified important differences in circulating biomarkers, cardiac/arterial characteristics, prognosis, and response to spironolactone across clinical {HFpEF} phenogroups. These findings suggest distinct underlying mechanisms across clinically identifiable phenogroups of {HFpEF} that may benefit from different targeted interventions.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Hypertension is the leading cause of chronic disease and premature death in the United States. To date, most risk factors for hypertension have been identified at the individual (micro) level. The association of macro-level (area) socioeconomic factors and hypertension prevalence rates in the population has not been studied extensively. {METHODS}: We used the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to examine whether state socioeconomic status ({SES}) indicators predict the prevalence of self-reported hypertension. Quintiles of state median household income, unemployment rate among the population aged 16 to 64 years, and the proportion of the population under the national poverty line were used as the proxy for state {SES}. Hypertension status was determined by the question "Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that you have high blood pressure?" Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between state {SES} and hypertension with adjustment for individual covariates (demographic and socioeconomic factors and lifestyle behaviors). {RESULTS}: States with a median household income of \$43,225 or less (odds ratio [95\% confidence interval] = 1.16 [1.08-1.25]) and states with 18.7\% or more of residents living below the poverty line (odds ratio [95\% confidence interval] = 1.14 [1.04-1.24]) had a higher prevalence of hypertension than states with the most residents in the most advantageous quintile of the indicators. {CONCLUSION}: The observed state {SES}-hypertension association indicates that area {SES} may contribute to the burden of hypertension in community-dwelling adults.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamafacial.2017.1099},
	abstract = {Importance: Blepharoplasty consistently ranks among the most common facial plastic surgery procedure sought by both men and women. Despite the popularity of blepharoplasty, there has been little research focused on quantifying how eyelid surgery changes facial perceptions. Objectives: To quantify the effect of blepharoplasty on facial perceptions and measure patient-reported ratings of fatigue before and after surgery to compare observer and patient perceptions. Design, Setting, and Participants: A web-based survey experiment was conducted from January to February 2017, featuring photographs of female patients before and after blepharoplasty. Observers were randomly shown independent images of each patient and asked to rate perceived age, attractiveness, health, and energy level. Respondents saw only preoperative or postoperative photographs of each patient to reduce bias due to priming. Patient-reported outcomes were also collected. Main Outcomes and Measures: A multivariate mixed effects regression model was used to quantify the changes in each domain after surgery. Ordinal rank change was calculated to provide a measure of clinical effect size across the domains. To analyze patient-reported outcomes, a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney tests were performed to determine if there were differences in patient-perceived tiredness based on operative status. Results: A total of 401 participants (243 women, 152 men, and 6 not specified; mean age 25.9 years [range, 18-73 years]) successfully completed the survey and evaluated before-and-after photographs of 10 female patients (mean age, 59.8 years). The multivariable mixed effects model revealed that individuals are perceived as appearing significantly younger (-1.04 years; 95\% {CI}, -1.70 to -0.37 years) and more attractive (coefficient, 4.92; 95\% {CI}, 3.91-5.93) after blepharoplasty. Ratings of perceived health (coefficient, 4.33; 95\% {CI}, 3.28-5.37) and energy level (coefficient, 9.83; 95\% {CI}, 8.51-11.16) also improved significantly. After undergoing blepharoplasty, patients had significantly improved ratings of energy level compared with those who had not undergone blepharoplasty. Conclusions and Relevance: This is the first study, to date, aimed at quantifying the perceptions of facial aesthetic changes following blepharoplasty. The data demonstrate that individuals are rated as appearing more youthful, attractive, and healthy following blepharoplasty. Furthermore, both patients and casual observers perceived a significant improvement in energy level following blepharoplasty, a meaningful finding as the appearance of fatigue is a chief concern of the patients before they undergo blepharoplasty.

	abstract = {The cardiovascular research and clinical communities are ideally positioned to address the epidemic of noncommunicable causes of death, as well as advance our understanding of human health and disease, through the development and implementation of precision medicine. New tools will be needed for describing the cardiovascular health status of individuals and populations, including 'omic' data, exposome and social determinants of health, the microbiome, behaviours and motivations, patient-generated data, and the array of data in electronic medical records. Cardiovascular specialists can build on their experience and use precision medicine to facilitate discovery science and improve the efficiency of clinical research, with the goal of providing more precise information to improve the health of individuals and populations. Overcoming the barriers to implementing precision medicine will require addressing a range of technical and sociopolitical issues. Health care under precision medicine will become a more integrated, dynamic system, in which patients are no longer a passive entity on whom measurements are made, but instead are central stakeholders who contribute data and participate actively in shared decision-making. Many traditionally defined diseases have common mechanisms; therefore, elimination of a siloed approach to medicine will ultimately pave the path to the creation of a universal precision medicine environment.},

Here we describe the prevalence of hypertension in diverse Hispanic/Latino background groups and describe the proportion who are aware of their diagnosis, receiving treatment, and having their hypertension under control. {METHODS}: The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos is a longitudinal cohort study of 16,415 Hispanics/Latinos, aged 18-74 years from 4 {US} communities (Bronx, {NY}; Chicago, {IL}; Miami, {FL}; and San Diego, {CA}). At baseline (2008-2011) the study collected extensive measurements and completed questionnaires related to research on cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension was defined as measured blood pressure {\textgreater}/=140/90mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication. {RESULTS}: The total age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension in this study was 25.5\% as compared with 27.4\% in non-Hispanic whites in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Prevalence of hypertension increased with increasing age groups and was highest in Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Dominican background groups. The percent with hypertension who were aware, being treated with medication, or had their hypertension controlled was lower compared with {US} non-Hispanic whites with hypertension and it was lowest in those without health insurance. {CONCLUSIONS}: These findings indicate a significant deficit in treatment and control of hypertension among Hispanics/Latinos residing in the United States, particularly those without health insurance. Given the relative ease of identification of hypertension and the availability of low-cost medications, enabling better access to diagnostic and treatment services should reduce the burden of hypertension in Hispanic populations.},

	abstract = {The rapidly increasing volume of clinical information captured in Electronic Health Records ({EHRs}) has led to the application of increasingly sophisticated models for purposes such as disease subtype discovery and predictive modeling. However, increasing adoption of {EHRs} implies that in the near future, much of the data available for such purposes will be from a time period during which both the practice of medicine and the clinical use of {EHRs} are in flux due to historic changes in both technology and incentives. In this work, we explore the implications of this phenomenon, called non-stationarity, on predictive modeling. We focus on the problem of predicting delayed wound healing using data available in the {EHR} during the first week of care in outpatient wound care centers, using a large dataset covering over 150,000 individual wounds and 59,958 patients seen over a period of four years. We manipulate the degree of non-stationarity seen by the model development process by changing the way data is split into training and test sets. We demonstrate that non-stationarity can lead to quite different conclusions regarding the relative merits of different models with respect to predictive power and calibration of their posterior probabilities. Under the non-stationarity exhibited in this dataset, the performance advantage of complex methods such as stacking relative to the best simple classifier disappears. Ignoring non-stationarity can thus lead to sub-optimal model selection in this task.},

We now report results of the 6-year post-trial follow-up. {METHODS}: We invited surviving participants, who had previously been assigned to perindopril-indapamide or placebo and to intensive or standard glucose control (with the glucose-control comparison extending for an additional 6 months), to participate in a post-trial follow-up evaluation. The primary end points were death from any cause and major macrovascular events. {RESULTS}: The baseline characteristics were similar among the 11,140 patients who originally underwent randomization and the 8494 patients who participated in the post-trial follow-up for a median of 5.9 years (blood-pressure-lowering comparison) or 5.4 years (glucose-control comparison). Between-group differences in blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin levels during the trial were no longer evident by the first post-trial visit. The reductions in the risk of death from any cause and of death from cardiovascular causes that had been observed in the group receiving active blood-pressure-lowering treatment during the trial were attenuated but significant at the end of the post-trial follow-up; the hazard ratios were 0.91 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.84 to 0.99; P=0.03) and 0.88 (95\% {CI}, 0.77 to 0.99; P=0.04), respectively.

There was no evidence that intensive glucose control during the trial led to long-term benefits with respect to mortality or macrovascular events.

Peripheral arterial disease was associated with an increased risk of 11 different vascular events, including ischaemic heart disease (1.68, 1.58 to 1.79), heart failure (1.63, 1.52 to 1.75), aortic aneurysm (2.10, 1.79 to 2.45), and chronic kidney disease (1.31, 1.25 to 1.38), but not haemorrhagic stroke. The most common initial vascular event among those with peripheral arterial disease was chronic kidney disease (24.4\% of initial events), followed by ischaemic heart disease (18.5\% of initial events), heart failure (14.7\%), and atrial fibrillation (13.2\%). Overall estimates from this cohort were consistent with those derived from traditional studies when we pooled the findings in two meta-analyses. {CONCLUSIONS}: Raised blood pressure is a strong risk factor for peripheral arterial disease in a range of patient subgroups. Furthermore, clinicians should be aware that those with established peripheral arterial disease are at an increased risk of a range of other vascular events, including chronic kidney disease, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke.},

	abstract = {In hypertension, tolerability of drug treatment is important because individuals may see the use of antihypertensive medications as more troubling than their seemingly symptomless disease. This may result in noncompliance and ineffectual long term treatment. In the past 15 years, new antihypertensive medications have been marketed on the basis of the advantages they offer with regard to adverse effects and the unavoidable impact of such adverse effects on a person's quality of life. When related to health, quality of life refers to the physical, psychological and social dimensions of health that are influenced by a person's experiences, beliefs, expectations and perceptions. To measure this concept, many instruments, either generic or specific, may be used. The purpose of this study is to describe, by way of a critical review of the literature, the instruments that are most often used in the measurement of health-related quality of life ({HR}-{QOL}) in people using antihypertensive drug treatments. We carried out a search of the literature published in English in the period January 1966 to July 2000, looking for randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs. Using the Medline database, we included 77 papers in our review. Our main finding suggests that {HR}-{QOL} changes associated with antihypertensive treatment are measured with many different instruments. In almost all studies, at least 1 instrument specific to a health dimension was used, whereas not many used a generic instrument only. The most commonly measured {HR}-{QOL} dimensions were cognitive function, symptomatic well-being, sexual function, psychological well-being, sleep dysfunction, social participation and general health perception. Since the choice of dimensions to measure depends not only on the disease but also on the drug, this review adds further evidence that a generic instrument as well as a preference measurement should be added to a specific instrument.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation ({VALUE}) trial was designed to test the hypothesis that for the same blood-pressure control, valsartan would reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality more than amlodipine in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk. {METHODS}: 15?245 patients, aged 50 years or older with treated or untreated hypertension and high risk of cardiac events participated in a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of therapy based on valsartan or amlodipine. Duration of treatment was event-driven and the trial lasted until at least 1450 patients had reached a primary endpoint, defined as a composite of cardiac mortality and morbidity. Patients from 31 countries were followed up for a mean of 4.2 years. {FINDINGS}: Blood pressure was reduced by both treatments, but the effects of the amlodipine-based regimen were more pronounced, especially in the early period (blood pressure 4.0/2.1 mm Hg lower in amlodipine than valsartan group after 1 month; 1.5/1.3 mm Hg after 1 year; p{\textless}0.001 between groups). The primary composite endpoint occurred in 810 patients in the valsartan group (10.6\%, 25.5 per 1000 patient-years) and 789 in the amlodipine group (10.4\%, 24.7 per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio 1.04, 95\% {CI} 0.94-1.15, p=0.49). {INTERPRETATION}: The main outcome of cardiac disease did not differ between the treatment groups. Unequal reductions in blood pressure might account for differences between the groups in cause-specific outcomes. The findings emphasise the importance of prompt blood-pressure control in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk.},

The relative percentage of cases of sudden death after pacemaker implantation was high in the groups with Adams-Stokes attacks (12\%) and Adams-Stokes equivalents (13\%). In patients paced for Adams-Stokes attacks, sudden death occurred more frequently in the first year after pacemaker implantation (P less than 0.015) than during the following years.

The objective of this analysis was to assess the effect of both T2DM and baseline cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) risk on the treatment effect of intensive blood pressure lowering. {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: The individual patient data from the {ACCORD}-{BP} and {SPRINT} studies were pooled and follow-up durations harmonized. Both studies randomized hypertensive patients to an {SBP} target of {\textless}120 {mmHg} or a target of {\textless}140 {mmHg}. The composite primary end point consisted of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, stroke, and cardiovascular death. The interaction between intensive blood pressure lowering and both T2DM and 10-year cardiovascular risk was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. {RESULTS}: The cohort consisted of 14,094 patients with mean age 66 +/- 8.9 years and mean baseline {SBP} 139.5 +/- 15.6 {mmHg}; 33.6\% had T2DM. The hazard ratio for the primary composite end point was 0.82 (95\% {CI} 0.73-0.93) (P = 0.0017). The interaction between intensive blood pressure lowering and T2DM was nonsignificant (P = 0.13). The 10-year cardiovascular risk was higher in primary prevention patients with T2DM, but risk did not interact with the treatment effect (P = 0.84). {CONCLUSIONS}: Intensive blood pressure lowering may have a similar favorable effect and appears to decrease cardiovascular events in both patients with and patients without T2DM.},

In total, 1034 subjects participated. The {SF}-36 dimension scores of hypertensive subjects were compared with those of normotensive subjects. Independent association of hypertension with each quality-of-life domain was analysed using a multiple linear regression model, so were the effects of comorbidity on the {HRQL} of hypertensive subjects. {RESULTS}: Nine hundred and nineteen respondents were included in the analysis, and 16.97\% reported hypertension. Respondents with hypertension scored lower than those without hypertension in at least five {SF}-36 dimensions. The dimension of role limitations due to physical problems was the most affected, whereas the mental health dimension was the least affected. Hypertensive subjects with comorbidity experienced lower {SF}-36 scores than hypertensive subjects without comorbidity. {CONCLUSIONS}: Hypertension markedly impairs quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health. Comorbidity further deteriorates {HRQL} among people with hypertension.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The Medication Regimen Complexity Index ({MRCI}) is a 65-item instrument that can be used to quantify medication regimen complexity at the patient level, capturing all prescribed and over-the-counter medications. Although the {MRCI} has been used in several studies, the narrow scope of the initial validation limits application at a population or clinical practice level. {PURPOSE}: To conduct a {MRCI} validation pertinent to the desired clinical use to identify patients for medication therapy management interventions. {METHODS}: An expert panel of clinical pharmacists ranked medication regimen complexity for two samples of cases: a single-disease cohort (diabetes mellitus) and a multiple-disease cohort (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, human immunodeficiency virus infection, geriatric depression). Cases for expert panel review were selected from 400 ambulatory clinic patients, and each case description included data that were available via claims or electronic medical records ({EMRs}). Construct validity was assessed using patient-level {MRCI} scores, medication count, and additional patient data. Concordance was evaluated using weighted kappa agreement statistic, and correlations were determined using Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (rho) or Kendall tau. {RESULTS}: Moderate to good concordance between patient-level {MRCI} scores and expert medication regimen complexity ranking was observed (claims data, consensus ranking: single-disease cohort 0.55, multiple disease cohort 0.63). In contrast, only fair to moderate concordance was observed for medication count (single-disease cohort 0.33, multiple-disease cohort 0.48). Adding more-detailed administration directions from {EMR} data did not improve concordance. {MRCI} convergent validity was supported by strong correlations with medication count (all cohorts 0.90) and moderate correlations with morbidity measures (e.g., all cohorts; number of comorbidities 0.46, Chronic Disease Score 0.46). Nonsignificant correlation of {MRCI} scores with age and gender (all cohorts 0.08 and 0.06, respectively) supported {MRCI} divergent validity. {LIMITATIONS}: This study used cross-sectional, retrospective patient data for a small number of patients and clinical pharmacists from only two universities; therefore, results may have limited generalizability. {CONCLUSIONS}: The patient-level {MRCI} is a valid tool for assessing medication regimen complexity that can be applied by using data commonly found in claims and {EMR} databases and could be useful to identify patients who may benefit from medication therapy management.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Predictive analytics in emergency care has mostly been limited to the use of clinical decision rules ({CDRs}) in the form of simple heuristics and scoring systems. In the development of {CDRs}, limitations in analytic methods and concerns with usability have generally constrained models to a preselected small set of variables judged to be clinically relevant and to rules that are easily calculated. Furthermore, {CDRs} frequently suffer from questions of generalizability, take years to develop, and lack the ability to be updated as new information becomes available. Newer analytic and machine learning techniques capable of harnessing the large number of variables that are already available through electronic health records ({EHRs}) may better predict patient outcomes and facilitate automation and deployment within clinical decision support systems. In this proof-of-concept study, a local, big data-driven, machine learning approach is compared to existing {CDRs} and traditional analytic methods using the prediction of sepsis in-hospital mortality as the use case. {METHODS}: This was a retrospective study of adult {ED} visits admitted to the hospital meeting criteria for sepsis from October 2013 to October 2014. Sepsis was defined as meeting criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome with an infectious admitting diagnosis in the {ED}. {ED} visits were randomly partitioned into an 80\%/20\% split for training and validation. A random forest model (machine learning approach) was constructed using over 500 clinical variables from data available within the {EHRs} of four hospitals to predict in-hospital mortality. The machine learning prediction model was then compared to a classification and regression tree ({CART}) model, logistic regression model, and previously developed prediction tools on the validation data set using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) and chi-square statistics. {RESULTS}: There were 5,278 visits among 4,676 unique patients who met criteria for sepsis. Of the 4,222 patients in the training group, 210 (5.0\%) died during hospitalization, and of the 1,056 patients in the validation group, 50 (4.7\%) died during hospitalization. The {AUCs} with 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}) for the different models were as follows: random forest model, 0.86 (95\% {CI} = 0.82 to 0.90); {CART} model, 0.69 (95\% {CI} = 0.62 to 0.77); logistic regression model, 0.76 (95\% {CI} = 0.69 to 0.82); {CURB}-65, 0.73 (95\% {CI} = 0.67 to 0.80); {MEDS}, 0.71 (95\% {CI} = 0.63 to 0.77); and {mREMS}, 0.72 (95\% {CI} = 0.65 to 0.79). The random forest model {AUC} was statistically different from all other models (p {\textless}/= 0.003 for all comparisons). {CONCLUSIONS}: In this proof-of-concept study, a local big data-driven, machine learning approach outperformed existing {CDRs} as well as traditional analytic techniques for predicting in-hospital mortality of {ED} patients with sepsis. Future research should prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of this approach and whether it translates into improved clinical outcomes for high-risk sepsis patients. The methods developed serve as an example of a new model for predictive analytics in emergency care that can be automated, applied to other clinical outcomes of interest, and deployed in {EHRs} to enable locally relevant clinical predictions.},

	abstract = {Importance: Health insurance is effective in preventing financial hardship from unexpected major health care events. However, it is also essential to assess whether vulnerable patients, particularly those from low-income families, are adequately protected from longitudinal health care costs for common chronic conditions such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ({ASCVD}). Objective: To examine the annual burden of total out-of-pocket health expenses among low-income families that included a member with {ASCVD}. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from January 2006 through December 2015, all families with 1 or more members with {ASCVD} were identified. Families were classified as low income if they had an income under 200\% of the federal poverty limit. Analyses began December 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Total annual inflation-adjusted out-of-pocket expenses, inclusive of insurance premiums, for all patients with {ASCVD}. We compared these expenses against annual family incomes. Out-of-pocket expenses of more than 20\% and more than 40\% of family income defined high and catastrophic financial burden, respectively. Results: We identified 22 521 adults with {ASCVD}, represented in 20 600 families in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. They correspond to an annual estimated 23 million or 9.9\% of {US} adults with a mean ({SE}) age of 65 (0.2) years and included 10.9 million women (47.1\%). They were represented in 21 million or 15\% of {US} families. Of these, 8.2 million families (39\%) were low income. The mean annual family income was \$57 143 (95\% {CI}, \$55 377-\$58 909), and the mean out-of-pocket expense was \$4415 (95\% {CI}, \$3735-\$3976). While financial burden from health expenses decreased throughout the study, even in 2014 and 2015, low-income families had 3-fold higher odds than mid/high-income families of high financial burden (21.4\% vs 7.6\%; {OR}, 3.31; 95\% {CI}, 2.55-4.31) and 9-fold higher odds of catastrophic financial burden (9.8\% vs 1.2\%; {OR}, 9.35; 95\% {CI}, 5.39-16.20), representing nearly 2 million low-income families nationally. Further, even among the insured, 1.6 million low-income families (21.8\%) experienced high financial burden and 721000 low-income families (9.8\%) experienced catastrophic out-of-pocket health care expenses in 2014 and 2015. Conclusions and Relevance: One in 4 low-income families with a member with {ASCVD}, including those with insurance coverage, experience a high financial burden, and 1 in 10 experience a catastrophic financial burden due to cumulative out-of-pocket health care expenses. To alleviate economic disparities, policy interventions must extend focus to improving not only access, but also quality of coverage, particularly for low-income families.},

At baseline, two years and four years, carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B-mode ultrasound, and left ventricular mass was assessed by M-mode echocardiography. {RESULTS}: Blood pressure ({BP}) was reduced by a mean of 6 mm Hg systolic and 4 mm Hg diastolic in the ramipril group compared with the placebo group (p{\textless}0.001). There was no difference between groups in the changes in common carotid artery wall thickness (p = 0.58) or in carotid plaque (p = 0.93). Left ventricular mass index decreased by 3.8 g/m2 (4\%) in the ramipril group compared with the placebo group (2p = 0.04). {CONCLUSIONS}: The results provide no support for the hypothesis that reduced atherosclerosis is responsible for the beneficial effects of {ACE} inhibitors on major coronary events. It is more likely that the benefits are due to lower {BP}, reduced left ventricular mass or other factors such as reversal of endothelial dysfunction.},

	abstract = {Survival in patients paced for high degree {AV} block has been demonstrated to be influenced by underlying cardiac disease in particular congestive heart failure. One previous study has suggested that dual chamber pacing may improve the vital prognosis for such patients. To investigate this, 74 patients treated with rate adaptive atrial synchronous ({VDD}) and 74 patients treated with {VVI} pacemakers for high degree {AV} block, were retrospectively studied for a mean of 5.4 years by life-table analysis. The two groups had an equal distribution of age, sex, date of pacemaker implantation, and concomitant cardiovascular diseases. Total mortality and estimated survival did not differ between the two groups. The estimated survival in the {VDD} group at 1, 3, and 5 years for patients without and with congestive heart failure was 94\%, 86\% and 78\%, and 92\%, 83\% and 72\%, respectively. In the {VVI} group the corresponding values were 95\%, 90\%, and 83\% for patients without congestive heart failure and 82\%, 64\%, and 47\% for those with congestive heart failure (P = 0.008). Compared to the expected survival rate of the general Swedish population, only the {VVI} group with congestive heart failure, had an excess mortality (P = 0.007). Patients with high degree {AV} block have a fairly normal vital prognosis irrespective of pacing mode. The prognosis for patients with congestive heart failure was negatively affected by {VVI} pacing. Thus, for patients with congestive heart failure the choice of pacing mode is of vital importance, whereas for patients without congestive heart failure, other factors such as feeling of well-being and exercise capacity should decide the final choice of pacing mode.},

	abstract = {Velocity-encoded cine-magnetic resonance imaging ({VEC}-{MRI}) is a new method for quantitation of blood flow with the potential to measure high-velocity jets across stenotic valves. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of {VEC}-{MRI} to measure transmitral velocity in patients with mitral stenosis. Sixteen patients with known mitral stenosis were studied. A 1.5 Tesla superconducting magnet was used to obtain velocity-encoded images in the left ventricular short-axis plane. Images were obtained throughout the cardiac cycle at 3 consecutive slices beginning proximal to the mitral coaptation point. To determine the optimal slice thickness for {MRI} imaging, both 10 mm and 5 mm thicknesses were used. Echocardiography including continuous-wave Doppler was performed on every patient within 2 hours of {MRI} imaging. Peak velocity was determined for both {VEC}-{MRI} and Doppler-echo images. Two observers independently measured the {VEC}-{MRI} mitral inflow velocities. Of the 16 patients, imaged data were incomplete in only 1 study, and all images were adequate for analysis. Strong correlations were found for measurements of mitral valve gradient for both 10 mm (peak r = 0.89, mean r = 0.84) and 5 mm (peak r = 0.82, mean r = 0.95) slice thicknesses. Measurements of peak velocity with {VEC}-{MRI} (10 mm) agreed well with Doppler: mean 1.46 m/s, mean of differences (Doppler {MRI}) 0.38 m/s, standard deviation of differences 0.2 m/s. These findings suggest that {VEC}-{MRI} can noninvasively determine the severity of mitral stenosis.},

In the present study, we applied hospital data to identify the risk of unplanned admission following {AMI} hospitalisations. {METHODS}: The study included 1660 consecutive {AMI} admissions. Predictive models were derived from 1107 randomly selected records and tested on the remaining 553 records. The electronic medical record ({EMR}) model was compared with a seven-factor predictive score known as the {HOSPITAL} score and a model derived from Elixhauser comorbidities. All models were evaluated for the ability to identify patients at high risk of 30-day ischaemic heart disease readmission and those at risk of all-cause readmission within 12 months following the initial {AMI} hospitalisation. {RESULTS}: The {EMR} model has higher discrimination than other models in predicting ischaemic heart disease readmissions (area under the curve ({AUC}) 0.78; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.71-0.85 for 30-day readmission). The positive predictive value was significantly higher with the {EMR} model, which identifies cohorts that were up to threefold more likely to be readmitted. Factors associated with readmission included emergency department attendances, cardiac diagnoses and procedures, renal impairment and electrolyte disturbances. The {EMR} model also performed better than other models ({AUC} 0.72; 95\% {CI} 0.66-0.78), and with greater positive predictive value, in identifying 12-month risk of all-cause readmission. {CONCLUSIONS}: Routine hospital data can help identify patients at high risk of readmission following {AMI}.

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that obstructive sleep apnea ({OSA}) is an independent risk factor for arterial hypertension. Because there are no controlled studies showing a substantial effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure ({nCPAP}) therapy on hypertension in {OSA}, the impact of treatment on cardiovascular sequelae has been questioned altogether. Therefore, we studied the effect of {nCPAP} on arterial hypertension in patients with {OSA}.{\textbar}Sixty consecutive patients with moderate to severe {OSA} were randomly assigned to either effective or subtherapeutic {nCPAP} for 9 weeks on average. Nocturnal polysomnography and continuous noninvasive blood pressure recording for 19 hours was performed before and with treatment. Thirty two patients, 16 in each group, completed the study. Apneas and hypopneas were reduced by approximately 95\% and 50\% in the therapeutic and subtherapeutic groups, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 9.9+/-11.4 mm Hg with effective {nCPAP} treatment, whereas no relevant change occurred with subtherapeutic {nCPAP} (P=0.01). Mean, diastolic, and systolic blood pressures all decreased significantly by approximately 10 mm Hg, both at night and during the day.{\textbar}Effective {nCPAP} treatment in patients with moderate to severe {OSA} leads to a substantial reduction in both day and night arterial blood pressure. The fact that a 50\% reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index did not result in a decrease in blood pressure emphasizes the importance of highly effective treatment. The drop in mean blood pressure by 10 mm Hg would be predicted to reduce coronary heart disease event risk by 37\% and stroke risk by 56\%.},

We aimed to reliably establish the prognostic significance of visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure, maximum blood pressure reached, untreated episodic hypertension, and residual variability in treated patients. {METHODS}: We determined the risk of stroke in relation to visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure (expressed as standard deviation [{SD}] and parameters independent of mean blood pressure) and maximum blood pressure in patients with previous transient ischaemic attack ({TIA}; {UK}-{TIA} trial and three validation cohorts) and in patients with treated hypertension (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial Blood Pressure Lowering Arm [{ASCOT}-{BPLA}]). In {ASCOT}-{BPLA}, 24-h ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring ({ABPM}) was also studied. {FINDINGS}: In each {TIA} cohort, visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) was a strong predictor of subsequent stroke (eg, top-decile hazard ratio [{HR}] for {SD} {SBP} over seven visits in {UK}-{TIA} trial: 6.22, 95\% {CI} 4.16-9.29, p{\textless}0.0001), independent of mean {SBP}, but dependent on precision of measurement (top-decile {HR} over ten visits: 12.08, 7.40-19.72, p{\textless}0.0001). Maximum {SBP} reached was also a strong predictor of stroke ({HR} for top-decile over seven visits: 15.01, 6.56-34.38, p{\textless}0.0001, after adjustment for mean {SBP}). In {ASCOT}-{BPLA}, residual visit-to-visit variability in {SBP} on treatment was also a strong predictor of stroke and coronary events (eg, top-decile {HR} for stroke: 3.25, 2.32-4.54, p{\textless}0.0001), independent of mean {SBP} in clinic or on {ABPM}. Variability on {ABPM} was a weaker predictor, but all measures of variability were most predictive in younger patients and at lower ({\textless}median) values of mean {SBP} in every cohort. {INTERPRETATION}: Visit-to-visit variability in {SBP} and maximum {SBP} are strong predictors of stroke, independent of mean {SBP}.

Results All four subject groups had distinct gut microbiota taxonomy by partial least squares discriminant analysis ({PLS}-{DA}). More importantly, linear discriminant analysis effect size showed marked differences in function of the microbiota of {BHBP} and {WHBP} ({PLS}-{DA}) with {LDA} scores {\textless}1. This included pathways for synthesis and interconversion of amino acids and inflammatory antigens. Similarly, metabolites differed ({PLS}-{DA}) with {BHBP} having significantly higher sulfacetaldehyde, quinolinic acid, 5-aminolevulinic acid, leucine and phenylalanine and lower 4-oxoproline and l-anserine. Discussion Combination analyses of functional gut metabolic pathways and metabolomics data in this small pilot study suggest that {BHBP} may have greater oxidative stress markers in plasma, greater inflammatory potential of the gut microbiome and altered metabolites with gut microbial functions implying insulin resistance. A fuller understanding of these potential differences could lead to race-based treatments for hypertension.},

During the 6-month trial hydrochlorothiazide was added to the treatment programme of those patients whose blood pressure was not normalized. More individuals in the captopril group (33\%) required hydrochlorothiazide than in the propranolol group (22\%). As a group, those individuals who required a diuretic were heavier and had higher basal and end-of-study blood pressure than those individuals requiring only monotherapy. However, the basal quality-of-life indices were similar in the six treatment subgroups. The withdrawal rate from the study was twice as high for those patients treated with propranolol and methyldopa as for those treated with captopril, whether a diuretic was added or not. More individuals requiring a diuretic experienced sexual dysfunction and a substantial worsening of their general well-being and of physical symptom indices over the 24 weeks of the study (P less than 0.01), particularly in the captopril and propranolol treatment subgroups.

	abstract = {Large-scale randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of cholesterol-lowering, blood pressure-lowering, and anti-platelet therapy to prevent cardiovascular diseases. A challenge for clinicians is to apply group-level evidence from these trials to individual patients. Trials typically report a single treatment effect estimate which is the average effect of all participants, comprising patients who respond poorly, intermediately, and well. Clinicians would preferably make patient-tailored treatment decisions. Therefore, one would require an estimate of an individual patient's response to therapy. Although not yet widely recognized, trials contain this type of information. In this paper, we show how available information from landmark trials can be translated to an individual 'treatment score' through the use of multivariable therapeutic prediction models. These models provide an individual estimate of the absolute risk reduction in cardiovascular events given the specific combination of multiple clinical characteristics of a patient under care. Based on this individualized treatment estimate and metrics such as the individual number-needed-to-treat, clinicians together with their patients can decide whether drug treatment or what treatment intensity is worthwhile. Selective treatment of those who can anticipate the greatest benefit and the least harm on an individualized basis could reduce the number of unnecessary treatments and healthcare costs beyond that currently achievable by subgroup analyses based on single patient characteristics.},

We evaluated the impact of low {BP} on cardiovascular outcomes in a high-risk population of 15,244 hypertensive patients, almost half of whom had a history of coronary artery disease ({CAD}). In the prospective Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation ({VALUE}) trial, patients were randomized to valsartan or amlodipine regimens and followed for 4.2 years (mean) with no difference in the primary cardiovascular endpoint. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the relationship between average on-treatment {BP} and clinical outcomes. The relationship between {BP} and cardiovascular events was adjusted for age, gender and body mass index, and baseline qualifying risk factors and diseases (smoking, high total cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, proteinuria, {CAD}, previous stroke and left ventricular hypertrophy). {DBP} {\textgreater}/= 90 {mmHg}, compared with {\textless} 90 {mmHg}, was associated with increased incidence of the primary cardiovascular endpoint (all cardiac events); however, {DBP} {\textless} 70 {mmHg}, compared with {\textgreater}/= 70 {mmHg}, was not associated with increased incidence after covariate adjustment (no J-shaped curve). Similar results were observed for death, myocardial infarction ({MI}), heart failure and stroke, considered separately. Nadir for {MI} was at {DBP} of 76 {mmHg} and for stroke 60 {mmHg}. The ratio of {MI} to stroke increased with lower {DBP}. In {CAD} patients the {MI} to stroke ratio was more pronounced than in patients without {CAD} but there was no significant J-curve in either group. Systolic {BP} {\textgreater}/= 150 but not {\textless} 130 {mmHg}, compared with 130-149 {mmHg}, similarly was associated with increased risk for primary outcome. In conclusion, patients in {BP} strata {\textgreater}/= 150/90 {mmHg}, but not patients in {BP} strata {\textless} 130/70 {mmHg}, were at increased risk for adverse outcomes in this hypertensive, high-risk population. Although benefit in preventing {MI} in relation to preventing stroke levels off for the lowest {BPs}, these data provide no support for a J-curve in the treatment of high-risk hypertensive patients . The increase in the ratio of {MI} to stroke with lower {DBP} indicates target organ heterogeneity in that the optimal on-treatment {DBP} for cerebroprotection is below that for cardioprotection.},

A contemporary model for major bleeding associated with {AMI} treatment can stratify patients at elevated risk for bleeding and is needed to risk-adjust {AMI} practice and outcomes. Using the Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines ({ACTION} Registry-{GWTG}) database, an in-hospital major bleeding risk model was developed in a population of patients with {ST}-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-{ST}-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The model used only baseline variables and was developed (n = 72,313) and validated (n = 17,960) in patients with {AMI} (at 251 United States centers from January 2007 to December 2008). The 12 most statistically and clinically significant variables were incorporated into the final regression model. The calibration plots are shown, and the model discrimination is demonstrated in derivation and validation cohorts, as well as across key subgroups. The rate of major bleeding in the overall population was 10.8\%. The 12 factors associated with major bleeding in the model were heart rate, baseline hemoglobin, female gender, baseline serum creatinine, age, electrocardiographic changes, heart failure or shock, diabetes, peripheral artery disease, body weight, systolic blood pressure, and home warfarin use. The risk model discriminated well in the derivation (C-statistic = 0.73) and validation (C-statistic = 0.71) cohorts. A risk score for major bleeding corresponded well with observed bleeding: very low risk (3.9\%), low risk (7.3\%), moderate risk (16.1\%), high risk (29.0\%), and very high risk (39.8\%). In conclusion, the {ACTION} Registry-{GWTG} in-hospital major bleeding model stratifies risk for major bleeding using variables at presentation and enables risk-adjusted bleeding outcomes for quality improvement initiatives and clinical decision making.},

	abstract = {Patients who adhere to preventive therapies may be more likely to engage in a broad spectrum of behaviors consistent with a healthy lifestyle. Because many of these behaviors cannot be measured easily, observational studies of outcomes associated with the long-term use of preventive therapies are subject to the so-called "healthy user bias." To better understand this effect, the authors examined the association between adherence to statin therapy and the use of preventive health services in a Pennsylvania cohort of 20,783 new users of statins between 1996 and 2004. After adjustment for age, gender, and various comorbid conditions, patients who filled two or more prescriptions for a statin during a 1-year ascertainment period were more likely than patients who filled only one prescription to receive prostate-specific antigen tests (hazard ratio ({HR})=1.57, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 1.17, 2.19), fecal occult blood tests ({HR}=1.31, 95\% {CI}: 1.12, 1.53), screening mammograms ({HR}=1.22, 95\% {CI}: 1.09, 1.38), influenza vaccinations ({HR}=1.21, 95\% {CI}: 1.12, 1.31), and pneumococcal vaccinations ({HR}=1.46, 95\% {CI}: 1.17, 1.83) during follow-up. These results suggest that patients who adhere to chronic therapies are more likely to seek out preventive health services, such as screening tests and vaccinations. Further work is needed to identify study design and analysis methods that can be used to minimize the healthy user bias in studies of preventive therapies.},

The {EQ}-5D, perceived health and mental health questions were used to test construct and discriminate validity. Self-reported work, physical and cognitive limits tested predictive validity and number of chronic conditions assessed concurrent validity. {RESULTS}: Both Mental Component Summary Scores ({MCS}) and Physical Component Summary Scores ({PCS}) were shown to have high internal consistency reliability (alpha {\textgreater} .80). {PCS} showed high test-retest reliability ({ICC} = .78) while {MCS} demonstrated moderate reliability ({ICC} = .60). {PCS} had high convergent validity for {EQ}-5D items (except self-care) and physical health status (r {\textgreater} .56). {MCS} demonstrated moderate convergent validity on {EQ}-5D and mental health items (r {\textgreater} .38). {PCS} distinguish between groups with different physical and work limitations. Similarly, {MCS} distinguished between groups with and without cognitive limitations. The {MCS} and {PCS} showed perfect dose response when variations in scores were examined by participant's chronic condition status. {CONCLUSIONS}: Both component scores showed adequate reliability and validity with the 2003-2004 {MEPS} and should be suitable for use in a variety of proposes within this database.},

	abstract = {Current guidelines from the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommend first-line treatment with a thiazide diuretic but do not provide specific guidance for obese patients. The renin system is activated in obesity-associated arterial hypertension. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the oral direct renin inhibitor aliskiren could provide additive blood pressure lowering in obese patients with hypertension (body mass index {\textgreater}or=30 kg/m(2); mean sitting diastolic blood pressure: 95 to 109 mm Hg) who had not responded to 4 weeks of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide ({HCTZ}) 25 mg. After a 2- to 4-week washout, 560 patients received single-blind {HCTZ} (25 mg) for 4 weeks; 489 nonresponders were randomly assigned to double-blind aliskiren (150 mg), irbesartan (150 mg), amlodipine (5 mg), or placebo for 4 weeks added to {HCTZ} (25 mg), followed by 8 weeks on double the initial doses of aliskiren, irbesartan, or amlodipine. After 8 weeks of double-blind treatment (4 weeks on the higher dose), aliskiren/{HCTZ} lowered blood pressure by 15.8/11.9 mm Hg, significantly more (P{\textless}0.0001) than placebo/{HCTZ} (8.6/7.9 mm Hg). Aliskiren/{HCTZ} provided blood pressure reductions similar to those with irbesartan/{HCTZ} and amlodipine/{HCTZ} (15.4/11.3 and 13.6/10.3 mm Hg, respectively), with similar tolerability to placebo/{HCTZ}. Adverse event rates were highest with amlodipine/{HCTZ} because of a higher incidence of peripheral edema (11.1\% versus 0.8\% to 1.6\% in other groups). In conclusion, combination treatment with aliskiren is a highly effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option for obese patients with hypertension who fail to achieve blood pressure control with first-line thiazide diuretic treatment.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Peripheral arterial disease ({PAD}) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. Hypertension is a risk factor for {PAD}. Treatment for hypertension must be compatible with the symptoms of {PAD}. Controversy regarding the effects of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade for hypertension in patients with {PAD} has led many physicians to stop prescribing beta-adrenoreceptor blockers. Little is known about the effects of other classes of anti-hypertensive drugs in the presence of {PAD}. This is the second update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003. {OBJECTIVES}: To determine the effects of anti-hypertensive drugs in patients with both raised blood pressure and symptomatic {PAD} in terms of the rate of cardiovascular events and death, symptoms of claudication and critical leg ischaemia, and progression of atherosclerotic {PAD} as measured by ankle brachial index ({ABI}) changes and the need for revascularisation (reconstructive surgery or angioplasty) or amputation. {SEARCH} {METHODS}: For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Specialised Register (last searched March 2013) and {CENTRAL} (2013, Issue 2). {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: Randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}) of at least one anti-hypertensive treatment against placebo or two anti-hypertensive medications against each other, with interventions lasting at least one month. Trials had to include patients with symptomatic {PAD}. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Data were extracted by one author ({DAL}) and checked by the other ({GYHL}). Potentially eligible studies were excluded when the results presentation prevented adequate extraction of data and enquiries to authors did not yield raw data. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Eight {RCTs} were included with a total of 3610 {PAD} patients. Four studies compared a recognised class of anti-hypertensive treatment with placebo and four studies compared two anti-hypertensive treatments with each other. Studies were not pooled due to the variation of the comparisons and the outcomes presented. Overall the quality of the available evidence was unclear, primarily as a result of a lack of detail in the study reports on the randomisation and blinding procedures and incomplete outcome data. Two studies compared angiotensin converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors against placebo. In one study there was a significant reduction in the number of cardiovascular events in patients receiving ramipril (odds ratio ({OR}) 0.72, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.58 to 0.91; n = 1725). In the second trial using perindopril (n = 52) there was a marginal increase in claudication distance but no change in {ABI} and a reduction in maximum walking distance. A trial comparing the calcium antagonist verapamil versus placebo in patients undergoing angioplasty (n = 96) suggested that verapamil reduced restenosis (per cent diameter stenosis (+/- {SD}) 48.0\% +/- 11.5 versus 69.6\% +/- 12.2; P {\textless} 0.01), although this was not reflected in the maintenance of a high {ABI} (0.76 +/- 0.10 versus 0.72 +/- 0.08 for verapamil versus placebo). Another study (n = 80) demonstrated no significant difference in arterial intima-media thickness ({IMT}) in men receiving the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide ({HCTZ}) compared to those receiving the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker doxazosin (-0.12 +/- 0.14 mm and -0.08 +/- 0.13 mm, respectively; P = 0.66). A study (n = 36) comparing telmisartan to placebo found a significant improvement in maximum walking distance at 12 months with telmisartan (median (interquartile range ({IQR})) 191 m (157 to 226) versus 103 m (76 to 164); P {\textless} 0.001) but no differences in {ABI} (median ({IQR}) 0.60 (0.60 to 0.77) versus 0.52 (0.48 to 0.67)) or arterial {IMT} (median ({IQR}) 0.08 cm (0.07 to 0.09) versus 0.09 cm (0.08 to 0.10)). Two studies compared the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker nebivolol with either the thiazide diuretic {HCTZ} or with metoprolol. Both studies found no significant differences in intermittent or absolute claudication distance, {ABI}, or all-cause mortality between the anti-hypertensives. A subgroup analysis of {PAD} patients (n = 2699) in a study which compared a calcium antagonist-based strategy (verapamil slow release ({SR}) +/- trandolapril) to a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker-based strategy (atenolol +/- hydrochlorothiazide) found no significant differences in the composite endpoints of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke with or without revascularisation ({OR} 0.90, 95\% {CI} 0.76 to 1.07 and {OR} 0.96, 95\% {CI} 0.82 to 1.13, respectively). {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Evidence on the use of various anti-hypertensive drugs in people with {PAD} is poor so that it is unknown whether significant benefits or risks accrue. However, lack of data specifically examining outcomes in {PAD} patients should not detract from the overwhelming evidence on the benefit of treating hypertension and lowering blood pressure.},

Pharmacist interventions were classified, and a meta-analysis of mean changes of blood pressure ({BP}), total cholesterol ({TC}), {LDL} cholesterol, {HDL} cholesterol, and {BMI} was performed using random-effects models. {RESULTS} The meta-analysis included 15 {RCTs} (9,111 outpatients) in which interventions were conducted exclusively by pharmacists in 8 studies and in collaboration with physicians, nurses, dietitians, or physical therapists in 7 studies. Pharmacist interventions included medication management, educational interventions, feedback to physicians, measurement of {CVD} risk factors, or patient-reminder systems. Compared with usual care, pharmacist care was associated with significant reductions for systolic {BP} (12 studies with 1,894 patients; -6.2 {mmHg} [95\% {CI} -7.8 to -4.6]); diastolic {BP} (9 studies with 1,496 patients; -4.5 {mmHg} [-6.2 to -2.8]); {TC} (8 studies with 1,280 patients; -15.2 mg/{dL} [-24.7 to -5.7]); {LDL} cholesterol (9 studies with 8,084 patients; -11.7 mg/{dL} [-15.8 to -7.6]); and {BMI} (5 studies with 751 patients; -0.9 kg/m(2) [-1.7 to -0.1]). Pharmacist care was not associated with a significant change in {HDL} cholesterol (6 studies with 826 patients; 0.2 mg/{dL} [-1.9 to 2.4]). {CONCLUSIONS} This meta-analysis supports pharmacist interventions-alone or in collaboration with other health care professionals-to improve major {CVD} risk factors among outpatients with diabetes.},

We preselected ten diseases: atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, gout, human immunodeficiency virus infection, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. For each disease, patients were classified into seven categories based on the presence of evidence in diagnosis codes, primary notes, and specific medications. Twenty-five patients per disease category (a total number of 175 patients for each disease, 1750 patients for all ten diseases) were randomly selected for manual chart review. Review results were used to estimate the positive predictive value ({PPV}), sensitivity, and F-score for each {EHR} component alone and in combination. {RESULTS}: The {PPVs} of single components were inconsistent and inadequate for accurately phenotyping (0.06-0.71). Using two or more {ICD} codes improved the average {PPV} to 0.84. We observed a more stable and higher accuracy when using at least two components (mean +/- standard deviation: 0.91 +/- 0.08). Primary notes offered the best sensitivity (0.77). The sensitivity of {ICD} codes was 0.67. Again, two or more components provided a reasonably high and stable sensitivity (0.59 +/- 0.16). Overall, the best performance (F score: 0.70 +/- 0.12) was achieved by using two or more components. Although the overall performance of using {ICD} codes (0.67 +/- 0.14) was only slightly lower than using two or more components, its {PPV} (0.71 +/- 0.13) is substantially worse (0.91 +/- 0.08). {CONCLUSION}: Multiple {EHR} components provide a more consistent and higher performance than a single one for the selected phenotypes. We suggest considering multiple {EHR} components for future phenotyping design in order to obtain an ideal result.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Adults aged 65 and older are disproportionately affected by hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, which are established risk factors for cardiovascular disease ({CVD}). Although risk reduction strategies among older adults, including control of {CVD} risk factors, can lead to a decline in premature {CVD} morbidity and mortality, the prevalence of these risk factors has generally increased in the past decade among elders and risk factor control rates have been suboptimal. We assess prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control rates among U.S. adults aged 65 and older with respect to hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes and describe predictors associated with awareness and management of these factors. {METHODS}: Analysis of nationally representative data collected from adults aged 65 and older (n = 3,810) participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. {RESULTS}: Women have a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension than men (76.6\% vs 63.0\%) and a significantly lower rate of control when treated pharmacologically (42.9\% vs 57.9\%). Dyslipidemia prevalence is 60.3\% overall, and women are significantly more likely to be aware of their condition than men (71.1\% vs 59.1\%). Diabetes affects 21.2\% of older adults, and 50.9\% of prevalent cases are treated pharmacologically. Goal attainment among those treated is problematic for all three conditions-hypertension (48.8\%), dyslipidemia (64.9\%), and diabetes (50.4\%). Having two or more doctor visits annually is associated with goal attainment for dyslipidemia. {CONCLUSIONS}: Knowledge of cardiovascular health in older adults and understanding gender gaps in awareness can help physicians and policymakers improve disease management and patient education programs.},

It has been suggested that representation changes reflect the storage of a skill, i.e., the motor memory trace. If a reflection of the trace, such modifications should persist after training is stopped for as long as the skill is retained. The objective here was to test the persistence of learning-related changes in the representation of the forelimb of the rat after learning a reaching task using repeated epidural stimulation mapping of primary motor cortex. It is shown that the forelimb representations enlarge after 8 days of training (n=8) but contract while performing arm movements without learning (n=7, p=0.006); hindlimb representations remain unchanged. Enlargement correlated with learning success (r=0.82; p=0.012). Subsequently, after 8 days without training, representation size reverted to baseline while the motor skill was retained. Somatotopy remained unaltered by a second training phase in which performance did not improve further (n=5). These findings suggest that successful acquisition but not storage of a motor skill depends on cortical map changes. The motor memory trace in rats may require changes in motor cortex organization other than those detected by stimulation mapping.},

We investigated the {CV} and renal benefits associated with these {BP} targets in the high-{CV}-risk population of the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global End Point Trial ({ONTARGET}). {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the proportion of in-treatment visits before the occurrence of an event ({\textless}25\%-{\textgreater}75\%) in which {BP} was reduced to {\textless}140/90 or {\textless}130/80 mm Hg. After adjustment for demographic and clinical variables, a progressive increase in the proportion of visits in which {BP} was reduced to {\textless}140/90 or {\textless}130/80 mm Hg was associated with a progressive reduction in the risk of stroke, new onset of microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria, and return to normoalbuminuria in albuminuric patients. An increased frequency of {BP} control to either target did not have any consistent effect on the adjusted risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure. The adjusted risk of {CV} events was reduced by increasing the frequency of {BP} control to {\textless}140/90 mm Hg, but not to {\textless}130/80 mm Hg. Similar findings were obtained for the achievement of the {BP} target in the visit preceding a {CV} event. {CONCLUSION}: The more frequent achievement of the {BP} targets recommended by guidelines led to cerebrovascular and renal protection, but did not increase cardiac protection. Overall, {CV} protection was favorably affected by the less tight but not by the tighter {BP} target. Clinical Trial Registration-{URL}: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Care management has become a widespread strategy for improving chronic illness care. However, primary care provider ({PCP}) participation in programs has been poor. Because the success of care management relies on provider engagement, understanding provider perspectives is necessary. {OBJECTIVE}: Our goal was to identify care management functions most valuable to {PCPs} in hypertension treatment. {DESIGN}: Six focus groups were conducted to discuss current challenges in hypertension care and identify specific functions of care management that would improve care. {PARTICIPANTS}: The study included 39 {PCPs} (participation rate: 83 \%) representing six clinics, two of which care for large African American populations and four that are in underserved locations, in the greater Baltimore metropolitan area. {APPROACH}: This was a qualitative analysis of focus groups, using grounded theory and iterative coding. {KEY} {RESULTS}: Providers desired achieving blood pressure control more rapidly. Collaborating with care managers who obtain ongoing patient data would allow treatment plans to be tailored to the changing life conditions of patients. The P.A.R.T.N.E.R. framework summarizes the care management functions that providers reported were necessary for effective collaboration: Partner with patients, providers, and the community; Arrange follow-up care; Resolve barriers to adherence; Track treatment response and progress; Navigate the health care system with patients; Educate patients \& Engage patients in self-management; Relay information between patients and/or provider(s). {CONCLUSIONS}: The P.A.R.T.N.E.R. framework is the first to offer a checklist of care management functions that may promote successful collaboration with {PCPs}. Future research should examine the validity of this framework in various settings and for diverse patient populations affected by chronic diseases.},

The objective of this "proof-of-concept" study was to investigate the effect on {BP} of a combination of single oral doses of sildenafil (50 mg) and {ISMN} (10 mg) in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. Six subjects with treatment-resistant hypertension were included, and their usual antihypertensive medication was continued during the study. Sildenafil alone, {ISMN} alone, and the combination all reduced brachial and central aortic {BPs} compared with placebo. The combination of sildenafil and {ISMN} produced the largest fall in {BP} (maximum brachial {BP} reduction of 26/18 mm Hg compared with placebo), without producing significant adverse effects. {ISMN}, alone and in combination with sildenafil, also reduced arterial wave reflection and central {BP}. In summary, in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension maintained on their usual antihypertensive treatment, sildenafil given alone and {ISMN} given alone both acutely reduced {BP}. There was additional {BP} reduction when these drugs were given in combination. In this therapeutically challenging group of patients, the combination of an {NO} donor drug and a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor may represent an effective treatment.

This survey was designed to evaluate the current state of clinical pharmacy services in the family practice residency program ({FPRP}) in the United States. {METHODS}: All {FPRPs} were contacted to identify clinical pharmacists involved with their programs. These pharmacists were directed to a password-protected Web address where the survey was posted. Completed surveys were submitted on-line, and data were retrieved for analysis. {RESULTS}: Of the 579 residencies, 155 (26.7\%) acknowledged 174 clinical pharmacists working within their program. Responses were received by 130 of the pharmacists (74.7\% response rate). These pharmacists held academic appointments in both their institution's school of pharmacy (80\%) and the school of medicine (53.2\%). The mean age of the respondents was 36.5 +/- 8.2 years, and the mean salary was \$66,000 (range \$46,000-\$125,000). A majority of the pharmacists received their funding from a single source, and 32.2\% received full salary support from the {FPRP}. The respondents spent more than half of their time with the residency program.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The ambulatory arterial stiffness index ({AASI}), derived from ambulatory blood pressure ({BP}) monitoring recordings, is an indirect marker of arterial stiffness and a potential predictor of cardiovascular risk. Resistant hypertension is defined as uncontrolled office {BP} despite the use of at least three antihypertensive drugs. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the {AASI} prognostic value in patients with resistant hypertension. {METHODS}: At baseline, 547 patients underwent clinical-laboratory, and 24-h ambulatory {BP} monitoring examinations. {AASI} was defined as 1 minus the regression slope of {DBP} on {SBP}, and was calculated by standard and symmetric regression. Primary endpoints were a composite of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities. Multiple Cox regression was used to assess associations between {AASI} and subsequent endpoints. {RESULTS}: After median follow-up of 4.8 years, 101 patients (18.4\%) reached the primary endpoint, and 65 all-cause deaths (11.9\%) occurred (45 from cardiovascular causes). 24-h {AASI} was the best independent predictor of composite endpoint (hazard ratio 1.46, 95\% confidence interval 1.12-1.92, for increments of 1-{SD} = 0.14), whereas cardiovascular mortality was best predicted by night-time {AASI} (hazard ratio 1.73, 95\% confidence interval 1.13-2.65), after adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors, including mean ambulatory {BPs} and nocturnal {BP} reduction. Symmetric {AASI} was not superior to standard {AASI}. In sensitivity analysis, 24-h {AASI} was a better predictor of cardiovascular outcomes in women, in younger individuals, and in nondiabetic individuals. {CONCLUSION}: {AASI} is a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in resistant hypertension, over and beyond traditional risk factors and other ambulatory {BP} monitoring parameters.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Patient no-shows in outpatient delivery systems remain problematic. The negative impacts include underutilized medical resources, increased healthcare costs, decreased access to care, and reduced clinic efficiency and provider productivity. {OBJECTIVE}: To develop an evidence-based predictive model for patient no-shows, and thus improve overbooking approaches in outpatient settings to reduce the negative impact of no-shows. {METHODS}: Ten years of retrospective data were extracted from a scheduling system and an electronic health record system from a single general pediatrics clinic, consisting of 7,988 distinct patients and 104,799 visits along with variables regarding appointment characteristics, patient demographics, and insurance information. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the impact of variables on show or no-show status. Logistic regression was used to develop a no-show predictive model, which was then used to construct an algorithm to determine the no-show threshold that calculates a predicted show/no-show status. This approach aims to overbook an appointment where a scheduled patient is predicted to be a no-show. The approach was compared with two commonly-used overbooking approaches to demonstrate the effectiveness in terms of patient wait time, physician idle time, overtime and total cost. {RESULTS}: From the training dataset, the optimal error rate is 10.6\% with a no-show threshold being 0.74. This threshold successfully predicts the validation dataset with an error rate of 13.9\%. The proposed overbooking approach demonstrated a significant reduction of at least 6\% on patient waiting, 27\% on overtime, and 3\% on total costs compared to other common flat-overbooking methods. {CONCLUSIONS}: This paper demonstrates an alternative way to accommodate overbooking, accounting for the prediction of an individual patient's show/no-show status. The predictive no-show model leads to a dynamic overbooking policy that could improve patient waiting, overtime, and total costs in a clinic day while maintaining a full scheduling capacity.},

However, in the recent Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ({ACCORD}) trial, a lower {BP} was not beneficial. The optimal {BP} target in subjects with diabetes mellitus or those with impaired fasting glucose/glucose tolerance is therefore not well defined. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We performed {PUBMED}, {EMBASE}, and {CENTRAL} searches for randomized clinical trials from 1965 through October 2010 of antihypertensive therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance that enrolled at least 100 patients with achieved systolic {BP} of {\textless}/= 135 mm Hg in the intensive {BP} control group and {\textless}/= 140 mm Hg in the standard {BP} control group, had a follow-up of at least 1 year, and evaluated macrovascular or microvascular events. We identified 13 randomized clinical trials enrolling 37 736 participants. Intensive {BP} control was associated with a 10\% reduction in all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 0.90; 95\% confidence interval, 0.83 to 0.98), a 17\% reduction in stroke, and a 20\% increase in serious adverse effects, but with similar outcomes for other macrovascular and microvascular (cardiac, renal, and retinal) events compared with standard {BP} control. The results were similar in a sensitivity analysis using a bayesian random-effects model. More intensive {BP} control ({\textless}/= 130 mm Hg) was associated with a greater reduction in stroke, but did not reduce other events. Meta-regression analysis showed continued risk reduction for stroke to a systolic {BP} of {\textless}120 mm Hg. However, at levels {\textless}130 mm Hg, there was a 40\% increase in serious adverse events with no benefit for other outcomes. {CONCLUSIONS}: The present body of evidence suggests that in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus/impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance, a systolic {BP} treatment goal of 130 to 135 mm Hg is acceptable. However, with more aggressive goals ({\textless}130 mm Hg), we observed target organ heterogeneity in that the risk of stroke continued to fall, but there was no benefit regarding the risk of other macrovascular or microvascular (cardiac, renal and retinal) events, and the risk of serious adverse events even increased.},

	abstract = {This study developed and evaluated a method for ascertaining a newly diagnosed breast cancer case using multiple sources of data from the Medicare claims system. Predictors of an incident case were operationally defined as codes for breast cancer-related diagnoses and procedures from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician claims. The optimal combination of predictors was then determined from a logistic regression model using 1992 data from the linked {SEER} registries-Medicare claims data base and a sample of noncancer controls drawn from the {SEER} areas. While the {ROC} curve demonstrates that the model can produce levels of sensitivity and specificity above 90\%, the positive predictive value is comparatively low (67-70\%). This low predictive value is largely the result of the model's limitation in distinguishing recurrent and secondary malignancies from incident cases and possibly from the model identifying true incident cases not identified by {SEER}. Nevertheless, the logistic regression approach is a useful method for ascertaining incident cases because it allows for greater flexibility in changing the performance characteristics by selecting different cut-points depending on the application (e.g., high sensitivity for registry validation, high specificity for outcomes research). It also allows us to make specific adjustments to population based estimates of breast cancer incidence with claims.},

In this paper, we discuss key issues and subtle pitfalls specific to building predictive models from {EMR}. We highlight the importance of carefully considering both the special characteristics of {EMR} as well as the intended clinical use of the predictive model and show that failure to do so could lead to developing models that are less useful in practice.

	abstract = {Identification of tumor-derived proteins in the circulation may allow for early detection of cancer and evaluation of therapeutic responses. To identify circulating tumor-derived proteins, mice were immunized with concentrated culture medium conditioned by human breast cancer cells. Antibodies generated by hybridomas were screened against conditioned media from both normal epithelial cells and tumor cells. Antibody selectively reacting with tumor cell-conditioned media was further characterized. This led to the development of a monoclonal antibody (Alper-p280) that reacts with a newly identified 280-{kDa} secreted variant of human filamin-A. Circulating filamin-A was detected in patient plasma samples using Alper-p280 in an {ELISA} assay. Human plasma samples from 134 patients with brain, breast, or ovarian cancer, 15 patients with active arthritis, and 76 healthy controls were analyzed. Filamin-A protein levels in human cell lines and tissues were analyzed by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and electron and confocal microscopy. Circulating filamin-A was detected in the plasma of 109 of 143 patients with breast cancer and primary brain tumors. Plasma levels of filamin-A showed 89.5\% sensitivity (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 0.67\% to 0.99\%) and 97.8\% specificity (95\% {CI} = 0.88\% to 0.99\%) for glioblastoma at a cut-off of 21.0 ng/{mL}. Plasma levels of filamin-A ({\textgreater}36.0 ng/{mL}) had 96.7\% sensitivity (95\% {CI} = 0.80\% to 0.99\%) and 67.8\% specificity (95\% {CI} = 0.54\% to 0.79\%) for metastatic breast cancer. Filamin-A levels were increased in malignant breast or brain tissues, but not in normal control tissues. Filamin-A localized to lysosomes in {MDA}.{MB}.231 breast cancer cells, but not in normal human mammary epithelial cells, suggesting that filamin-A may undergo cancer-specific processing. Plasma filamin-A appears to be a specific and sensitive marker for patients with high-grade astrocytoma or metastatic breast cancer. Additional novel cancer biomarkers have been identified and are being developed alongside Alper-p280 for use in diagnosis of breast carcinoma and high-grade astrocytoma, and for use in the evaluation of therapeutic responses.},

Good adherence to harmful drug therapy was associated with increased mortality (2.90, 1.04 to 8.11). {CONCLUSION}: Good adherence to drug therapy is associated with positive health outcomes. Moreover, the observed association between good adherence to placebo and mortality supports the existence of the "healthy adherer" effect, whereby adherence to drug therapy may be a surrogate marker for overall healthy behaviour.},

	abstract = {Coxsackieviruses A10 ({CV}-A10) and A6 ({CV}-A6) have been associated with increasingly occurred sporadic hand-foot-mouth disease ({HFMD}) cases and outbreak events globally. However, our understanding of epidemiological and genetic characteristics of these new agents remains far from complete. This study was to explore the circulation of {CV}-A10 and {CV}-A6 in {HFMD} and their genetic characteristics in China. A hospital based surveillance was performed in three heavily inflicted regions with {HFMD} from March 2009 to August 2011. Feces samples were collected from children with clinical diagnosis of {HFMD}. The detection and genotyping of enteroviruses was performed by real-time {PCR} and sequencing of 5'{UTR}/{VP}1 regions. Phylogenetic analysis and selection pressure were performed based on the {VP}1 sequences. Logistic regression model was used to identify the effect of predominant enterovirus serotypes in causing severe {HFMD}. The results showed 92.0\% of 1748 feces samples were detected positive for enterovirus, with the most frequently presented serotypes as {EV}-71 (944, 54.0\%) and {CV}-A16 (451, 25.8\%). {CV}-A10 and {CV}-A6 were detected as a sole pathogen in 82 (4.7\%) and 44 (2.5\%) cases, respectively. Infection with {CV}-A10 and {EV}-71 were independently associated with high risk of severe {HFMD} ({OR} = 2.66, 95\% {CI}: 1.40-5.06; {OR} = 4.81, 95\% {CI}: 3.07-7.53), when adjusted for age and sex. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that distinct geographic and temporal origins correlated with the gene clusters based on {VP}1 sequences. An overall omega value of the {VP}1 was 0.046 for {CV}-A10 and 0.047 for {CV}-A6, and no positively selected site was detected in {VP}1 of both {CV}-A10 and {CV}-A6, indicating that purifying selection shaped the evolution of {CV}-A10 and {CV}-A6. Our study demonstrates variety of enterovirus genotypes as viral pathogens in causing {HFMD} in China. {CV}-A10 and {CV}-A6 were co-circulating together with {EV}-71 and {CV}-A16 in recent years. {CV}-A10 infection might also be independently associated with severe {HFMD}.},

We conducted a study to estimate incidence of {ACE}-related angioedema and explore its determinants in a large racially diverse patient population. We used linked medical and pharmacy records to identify all patients in the {US} Veterans Affairs Health Care System from April 1999 through December 2000 who received first prescriptions for antihypertensive medications. We studied 195 192 {ACE} initiators and 399 889 patients initiating other antihypertensive medications ({OAH}). New angioedema was identified by diagnosis codes using methods validated in a national sample of 869 angioedema cases with confirmation for over 95\% of cases. Overall, 0.20\% of {ACE} initiators developed angioedema while on the medication and the incidence rate was 1.97 (1.77 to 2.18) cases per 1000 person years. This compares with a rate of 0.51 (0.43 to 0.59) in {OAH} initiators and the adjusted relative risk estimate was 3.56 (2.82 to 4.44). Fifty five percent of cases occurred within 90 days of first {ACE} use but risk remained elevated with prolonged use, even beyond 1 year. We estimate that 58.3\% of angioedema in patients starting antihypertensives was related to {ACE}. We also found that angioedema rates were nearly 4-fold higher in blacks, 50\% higher in women, and 12\% lower in those with diabetes. This study provides a reliable estimate of angioedema incidence associated with {ACE} use in a diverse nontrial patient population, confirming that the incidence is low, but finding substantial variation by race, sex, and diabetes status.},

	abstract = {The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to abolish the risks associated with blood pressure ({BP}) elevation without adversely affecting quality of life. Drug selection is based on efficacy in lowering {BP} and in reducing cardiovascular ({CV}) end points, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Although the choice of initial drug therapy exerts some effect on long-term outcomes, it is evident that {BP} reduction per se is the primary determinant of {CV} risk reduction. Available data suggest that at least 75\% of patients will require combination therapy to achieve contemporary {BP} targets, and increasing emphasis is being placed on the practical tasks involved in consistently achieving and maintaining goal {BP} in clinical practice. It is within this context that the American Society of Hypertension presents this Position Paper on Combination Therapy for Hypertension. It will address the scientific basis of combination therapy, present the pharmacologic rationale for choosing specific drug combinations, and review patient selection criteria for initial and secondary use. The advantages and disadvantages of single-pill (fixed) drug combinations and the implications of recent clinical trials involving specific combination strategies will also be discussed.},

Among total thiazide users, the proportion who received hydrochlorothiazide remained stable (95.6\% in 2008), but the number of new users of hydrochlorothiazide decreased nearly 30\% during this period. In contrast, the proportion of chlorthalidone use among total thiazide users more than doubled (1.1\% in 2003 to 2.4\% in 2008), and the number of new chlorthalidone users increased by more than 40\%. At the time of initiation, chlorthalidone was more likely to be added to an existing antihypertensive regimen; one quarter (25.1\%) of new hydrochlorothiazide starts were in patients not receiving concurrent antihypertensive medications, compared with only 12.1\% for chlorthalidone (odds ratio, 0.44; 95\% confidence interval, 0.42-0.46). Evaluation of national prescribing trends indicates that hydrochlorothiazide remains the most commonly prescribed thiazide, but there appears to be a shift toward more new users of chlorthalidone.},

We recruited African American patients with hypertension (n = 18) and their family members (n = 12) from an urban, community-based clinical practice in Baltimore, Maryland. We conducted four separate 90-minute focus groups among patients with controlled (one group) and uncontrolled (one group) hypertension, as well as their family members (two groups). Trained moderators used open-ended questions to assess participants' perceptions regarding patient, family, clinic, and community-level factors influencing patients' effective hypertension self-management. {RESULTS}: Patient participants identified several facilitators (including family members' support and positive relationships with doctors) and barriers (including competing health priorities, lack of knowledge about hypertension, and poor access to community resources) that influence their hypertension self-management. Family members also identified several facilitators (including their participation in patients' doctor's visits and discussions with patients' doctors outside of visits) and barriers (including their own limited health knowledge and patients' lack of motivation to sustain hypertension self-management behaviors) that affect their efforts to support patients' hypertension self-management. {CONCLUSION}: African American patients with hypertension and their family members reported numerous patient, family, clinic, and community-level facilitators and barriers to patients' hypertension self-management.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The successful diffusion of new drugs is crucial for both pharmaceutical companies and patients-and of wider stakeholder concern, including for the funding of healthcare provision. Micro-level characteristics (the socio-demographic and professional characteristics of medical professionals), meso-level characteristics (the prescribing characteristics of doctors, the marketing efforts of pharmaceutical companies, interpersonal communication among doctors, drug attributes, and the characteristics of patients), and macro-level characteristics (government policies) all influence the diffusion of new drugs. This systematic literature review examines the micro- and meso-level characteristics of early prescribers of newly introduced drugs. Understanding the characteristics of early adopters may help to speed up the diffusion process, promote cost-efficient prescribing habits, forecast utilisation, and develop targeted intervention strategies. {METHODS}: The {PubMed} and Scopus electronic databases were chosen for their extensive coverage of the pertinent literature and used to identify 205 potentially relevant studies by means of a four-layered search string. The 35 studies deemed eligible were then synthetized carefully and critically, to extract variables relevant to this review. {RESULTS}: Early adoption of new drugs is not a personal trait, independent of drug type, but early adopters share both micro- and meso-level characteristics. At prescriber level, doctors' interest in particular therapeutic areas, participation in clinical trials, and volume of prescribing-either in total or within the therapeutic class of the new drug-increase the likelihood of early adoption. The marketing efforts of pharmaceutical companies and doctors' professional and social interactions leading to prescribing contagion are very powerful predictors of new drug uptake. At patient level, doctors with younger patients, patients with higher socioeconomic statuses and/or patients with poorer health statuses are more inclined to prescribe new drugs early. In contrast, the socio-demographic characteristics of prescribers and many practice-related factors play little role in the adoption process. {CONCLUSIONS}: The most powerful predictors of new drug uptake include the doctors' strong scientific commitment, high prescribing volume in total or in within the therapeutic class of the new drug, high exposure to marketing, and intense communication with colleagues.},

There were 24 350 incident diagnoses of osteoporotic fracture in women and 7934 in men, and 9302 incident diagnoses of hip fracture in women and 5424 in men. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: First (incident) diagnosis of osteoporotic fracture (vertebral, distal radius, or hip) and incident hip fracture recorded in general practice records. {RESULTS}: Use of hormone replacement therapy ({HRT}), age, body mass index ({BMI}), smoking status, recorded alcohol use, parental history of osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, asthma, tricyclic antidepressants, corticosteroids, history of falls, menopausal symptoms, chronic liver disease, gastrointestinal malabsorption, and other endocrine disorders were significantly and independently associated with risk of osteoporotic fracture in women. Some variables were significantly associated with risk of osteoporotic fracture but not with risk of hip fracture. The predictors for men for osteoporotic and hip fracture were age, {BMI}, smoking status, recorded alcohol use, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, asthma, tricyclic antidepressants, corticosteroids, history of falls, and liver disease. The hip fracture algorithm had the best performance among men and women. It explained 63.94\% of the variation in women and 63.19\% of the variation in men. The D statistic values for discrimination were highest for hip fracture in women (2.73) and men (2.68) and were over twice the magnitude of the corresponding values for osteoporotic fracture. The {ROC} statistics for hip fracture were also high: 0.89 in women and 0.86 for men versus 0.79 and 0.69, respectively, for the osteoporotic fracture outcome. The algorithms were well calibrated with predicted risks closely matching observed risks. The {QFractureScore} for hip fracture also had good performance for discrimination and calibration compared with the {FRAX} (fracture risk assessment) algorithm. {CONCLUSIONS}: These new algorithms can predict risk of fracture in primary care populations in the {UK} without laboratory measurements and are therefore suitable for use in both clinical settings and for self assessment (www.qfracture.org). {QFractureScores} could be used to identify patients at high risk of fracture who might benefit from interventions to reduce their risk.},

	abstract = {Hypertension, a common risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is usually diagnosed and treated based on blood pressure readings obtained in the clinic setting. Blood pressure may differ considerably when measured inside versus outside of the clinic setting. Over the past several decades, evidence has accumulated on the following 2 approaches for measuring blood pressure outside of the clinic: ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ({ABPM}) and home blood pressure monitoring ({HBPM}). Both of these methods have a stronger association with cardiovascular disease outcomes than clinic blood pressure measurement. Controversy exists about whether {ABPM} or {HBPM} is superior for estimating risk for cardiovascular disease and under what circumstances these methods should be used in clinical practice for assessing blood pressure outside of the clinic. This review describes {ABPM} and {HBPM} procedures, the blood pressure phenotypic measurements that can be ascertained, and the evidence that supports the use of each approach to measuring blood pressure outside of the clinic. It also describes barriers to the successful implementation of {ABPM} and {HBPM} in clinical practice, proposes core competencies for the conduct of these procedures, and highlights important areas for future research.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Previous attempts to predict bacteremia have focused on selecting significant variables. However, these approaches have had limitations such as poor reproducibility in prediction accuracy and inconsistency in predictor selection. Here we propose a Bayesian approach to predict bacteremia based on the statistical distributions of clinical variables of previous patients, which has recently become possible through the adoption of electronic medical records. {METHODS}: In a derivation cohort, Bayesian prediction models were derived and their discriminative performance was compared with previous models under varying combinations of predictors. Then the Bayesian models were prospectively tested in a validation cohort. According to Bayesian probabilities of bacteremia, patients in both cohorts were grouped into bacteremia risk groups. {RESULTS}: Using the same prediction variables, the Bayesian predictions were more accurate than conventional rule-based predictions. Moreover, their better discriminative performance remained consistent despite variations in clinical variables. The receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) area of the Bayesian model with 20 predictors was 0.70 +/- 0.007 in the derivation cohort and 0.70 +/- 0.018 in the validation cohort. The prevalence of bacteremia in groups I, {II}, and {VI} (grouped according to probability ratio) were 1.9\%, 3.4\%, and 20.0\% in the derivation cohort, and 0.4\%, 3.2\%, and 18.4\% in the validation cohort, respectively. The overall prevalence of bacteremia was 6.9\% in both cohorts. {CONCLUSIONS}: In the present study, the Bayesian prediction model showed stable performance in predicting bacteremia and identifying risk groups, as the previous models did. The clinical significance of the Bayesian approach is expected to be demonstrated through a multicenter trial.},

Methods and results: In this double-blind, randomized, multicentre non-inferiority {CV}-safety trial, 444 patients (mean age 62 +/- 10 years, 54\% female) with osteoarthritis (92\%) or rheumatoid arthritis (8\%) and evidence of or at increased risk for coronary artery disease received celecoxib (100-200 mg bid), ibuprofen (600-800 mg tid), or naproxen (375-500 mg bid) with matching placebos in a 1: 1: 1 allocation, to assess the effect on 24-h ambulatory {BP} after 4 months. The change in mean 24-h systolic {BP} ({SBP}) in celecoxib, ibuprofen and naproxen-treated patients was -0.3 {mmHg} [95\% confidence interval ({CI}), -2.25, 1.74], 3.7 (95\% {CI}, 1.72, 5.58) and 1.6 {mmHg} (95\% {CI}, -0.40, 3.57), respectively. These changes resulted in a difference of - 3.9 {mmHg} (P = 0.0009) between celecoxib and ibuprofen, of - 1.8 {mmHg} (P = 0.12) between celecoxib and naproxen, and of - 2.1 {mmHg} (P = 0.08) between naproxen and ibuprofen. The percentage of patients with normal baseline {BP} who developed hypertension (mean 24-h {SBP} {\textgreater}/= 130 and/or diastolic {BP} {\textgreater}/= 80 {mmHg}) was 23.2\% for ibuprofen, 19.0\% for naproxen, and 10.3\% for celecoxib (odds ratio 0.39, P = 0.004 and odds ratio 0.49, P = 0.03 vs. ibuprofen and naproxen, respectively).

Self-reported nonadherence was measured by the 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale ({MMAS}-4) and 2-item cost-related nonadherence ({CRN}-2) scale at Year 11. Factors (demographic, health status, and access to care) were examined for association with the {MMAS}-4 and then for association with the {CRN}-2 scale. {RESULTS}: Nonadherence per the {MMAS}-4 and {CRN}-2 scale was reported by 40.7\% and 7.7\% of participants, respectively, with little overlap (3.7\%). Multivariable logistic regression analyses found that black race was significantly associated with nonadherence per the {MMAS}-4 (P = 0.002) and the {CRN}-2 scale (P = 0.005). Other correlates of nonadherence per the {MMAS}-4 (with independent associations) included having cancer (P = 0.04), a history of falls (P = 0.02), sleep disturbances (P = 0.04) and having a hospitalization in the previous 6 months (P = 0.005). Conversely, being unmarried (P = 0.049), having worse self-reported health (P = 0.04) and needs being poorly met by income (P = 0.02) showed significant independent associations with nonadherence per the {CRN}-2 scale. {CONCLUSIONS}: Self-reported medication nonadherence was common in older adults with chronic cardiovascular conditions and only one factor - race - was associated with both types. The research implication of this finding is that it highlights the need to measure both types of self-reported nonadherence in older adults. Moreover, the administration of these quick measures in the clinical setting should help identify specific actions such as patient education or greater use of generic medications or pill boxes that may address barriers to medication nonadherence.},

This guideline focuses on the risk factors unique to women, such as reproductive factors, and those that are more common in women, including migraine with aura, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and atrial fibrillation. {METHODS}: Writing group members were nominated by the committee chair on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association ({AHA}) Stroke Council's Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and the {AHA}'s Manuscript Oversight Committee. The panel reviewed relevant articles on adults using computerized searches of the medical literature through May 15, 2013. The evidence is organized within the context of the {AHA} framework and is classified according to the joint {AHA}/American College of Cardiology and supplementary {AHA} Stroke Council methods of classifying the level of certainty and the class and level of evidence. The document underwent extensive {AHA} internal peer review, Stroke Council Leadership review, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee review before consideration and approval by the {AHA} Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee. {RESULTS}: We provide current evidence, research gaps, and recommendations on risk of stroke related to preeclampsia, oral contraceptives, menopause, and hormone replacement, as well as those risk factors more common in women, such as obesity/metabolic syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and migraine with aura. {CONCLUSIONS}: To more accurately reflect the risk of stroke in women across the lifespan, as well as the clear gaps in current risk scores, we believe a female-specific stroke risk score is warranted.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Melatonin is a mediator in the establishment of the circadian rhythm of biological processes. It is produced in the pineal gland mainly during the night by stimulation of adrenergic beta1- and alpha1-receptors. Sleep disturbances are common side-effects of beta-blockers. The influence of specific beta-blockade as well as that of combined alpha-and beta-blockade on melatonin production has not been investigated in humans before. {METHODS}: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 15 healthy volunteers. Subjects received single oral doses of 40 mg (R)-propranolol, 40 mg (S)-propranolol, 50 mg (R)-atenolol, 50 mg (S)-atenolol, 25 mg (R,S)-carvedilol, 120 mg (R,S)-verapamil or placebo at 1800 hours. Urine was collected between 2200 hours and 0600 hours, and 6-sulfatoxy-melatonin ({aMT}6s), the main metabolite of melatonin which is almost completely eliminated in urine, was determined by radioimmunoassay ({RIA}). {RESULTS}: Mean nocturnal excretion of {aMT}6s in urine after intake of the drugs was as follows (in microg): placebo 26; (R)-propranolol 24 (-7\%, {NS}); (S)-propranolol 5 (-80\%, P {\textless} 0.001); (R)-atenolol 27 (+7\%, {NS}); (S)-atenolol 4 (-86\%, P {\textless} 0.01); (R,S)-carvedilol 23 (-10\%, {NS}); (R,S)-verapamil 29 (+14\%, {NS}). These data show that only the specifically beta-blocking (S)-enantiomers of propranolol and atenolol decrease the nocturnal production of melatonin whereas the non-beta-blocking (R)-enantiomers have no effect. Unexpectedly, (R,S)-carvedilol which inhibits both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors does not decrease melatonin production. {CONCLUSION}: These findings indicate that beta-blockers decrease melatonin release via specific inhibition of adrenergic beta1-receptors. Since lower nocturnal melatonin levels might be the reason for sleep disturbances, further clinical studies should investigate whether or not oral administration of melatonin might avoid this well-known side-effect of beta-blockers. The reason why (R,S)-carvedilol does not influence melatonin production remains to be determined.},

Forty-four hypertensive patients resistant to a 3-drug regimen (average blood pressure [{BP}] mm Hg, mean +/- standard deviation) were studied prospectively. Each patient was followed for a 12-month period. Adherence to treatment was evaluated through self-report, applying Morisky's questionnaire and the pill count method. Ambulatory {BP} monitoring and office {BP} measures were performed. By pill count, 63.6\% of the patients were adherent to treatment at the start of the survey and 94\% at the end, although 59\% of the patients still did not reach normal {BP} levels. We found that non-adherence was not associated with resistance to antihypertensive treatment. Therefore, after investigation, we concluded that patients who presented with uncontrolled arterial {BP} may be truly resistant hypertensive to treatment.},

The percentage of patients who experienced side effects was 17.2\% in the nicardipine group and 18.1\% in the trichlormethiazide group and 2.9\% and 4.3\% of participants, respectively, withdrew due to those side effects.

Information on blood pressure-lowering medication was collected in a questionnaire. Incidences of first-ever cardiac event, stroke or {CVD} death were followed. The mean period of follow-up was 7.4 years. {RESULTS}: During follow-up, 341 first-ever {CVD} events and 128 {CVD} deaths occurred. The risk of {CVD} morbidity or mortality was significantly higher in hypertensive men than in hypertensive women: cardiac event [relative risk ({RR}) = 3.11; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 2.13-4.54], stroke ({RR} = 1.50; 95\% {CI}: 1.01-2.22) and {CVD} death ({RR} = 2.96; 95\% {CI}: 1.86-4.20).

Two background factors--single household and concomitant diabetes--are apt to have an independent sex-specific impact on {CVD} risk. {CONCLUSIONS}: Gender remains a strong independent predictor for {CVD} morbidity and mortality, irrespective of antihypertensive intervention or other risk factors. Increased clinical attention should be given to hypertensive men living alone and hypertensive women with diabetes.},

The most common type of discrepancy was an incorrect medication documented on the chart. The most common reasons included over-the-counter ({OTC}) use of medications and patients not reporting use of medications. The presence of one or more medication discrepancies was associated with the use of three or more medications. Patient factors such as gender, age, and race were not associated with discrepancies. Patients able to recall the strength for more than 75\% of their medications had fewer discrepancies, while knowledge of the medication name, indication, or regimen had no association with discrepancies. {CONCLUSION}: Pharmacists play a critical role in identifying discrepancies between charted medication lists and self-reported medication use, independent of adherence. Inaccuracies in charted medications are frequent and often are related to use of {OTC} therapies and lack of communication and documentation during physician office visits. Knowledge of patient-related variables and other reasons for discrepancies may be useful in identifying patients at greatest risk for discrepancies and interventions to prevent and resolve them.},

The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, a large practice-based clinical trial, made it possible to examine consequences of observed changes in potassium during care in conventional practice settings. Normokalemic participants randomized to chlorthalidone (C) versus amlodipine or lisinopril as a first-step drug were stratified by year-1 potassium. Postyear-1 outcomes among hypokalemics (potassium, {\textless}3.5 mmol/L) and hyperkalemics (potassium, {\textgreater}5.4 mmol/L) were compared with normokalemics (potassium, 3.5-5.4 mmol/L). Year-1 hypokalemia incidence was 6.8\%; incidence in C (12.9\%) differed from amlodipine (2.1\%; P{\textless}0.001) and lisinopril (1.0\%; P{\textless}0.01). Hyperkalemia incidence (2.0\%) was greater in lisinopril (3.6\%) than in C (1.2\%; P{\textless}0.01) or amlodipine (1.9\%; P{\textless}0.01). Coronary heart disease occurred in 8.1\% with hypokalemia, 8.0\% with normokalemia, and 11.1\% with hyperkalemia. Overall, mortality was higher in hypokalemics than in normokalemics (Cox hazard ratio, 1.21 [95\% {CI}, 1.02-1.44]) with statistically significant (interaction, P{\textless}0.01) disparity in hazard ratios for the 3 treatment arms (hazard ratios, C=1.21, amlodipine=1.60, lisinopril=3.82). Hyperkalemia was associated with increased risk of combined cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.58 [95\% {CI}, 1.15-2.18]) without significant treatment interactions. In conventional practice settings, the uncommon appearance of hyperkalemia was associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Hypokalemia was associated with increased mortality; however, the statistically significant heterogeneity in hazard ratios across treatment groups strongly suggests that the observed increase in mortality is unrelated to the specific effects of C. Thus, for most patients, concerns about potassium levels should not influence the clinician's decision about initiating hypertension treatment with low-moderate doses of thiazide diuretics (12.5-25.0 mg of C).},

	abstract = {Clinical studies have documented morning-evening, administration-time differences of several different classes of hypertension medications in blood pressure ({BP})-lowering efficacy, duration of action, safety profile, and/or effects on the circadian {BP} pattern. In spite of these published findings, most hypertensive subjects, including those under combination therapy, are instructed by their physicians and pharmacists to ingest all of their {BP}-lowering medications in the morning. The potential differential reduction of cardiovascular ({CVD}) morbidity and mortality risk by a bedtime versus upon-awakening treatment schedule has never been evaluated prospectively. The prospective {MAPEC} study was specifically designed to test the hypothesis that bedtime chronotherapy with ≥1 hypertension medications exerts better {BP} control and {CVD} risk reduction than conventional therapy, i.e., all medications ingested in the morning. A total of 2156 hypertensive subjects, 1044 men/1112 women, 55.6 ± 13.6 (mean ± {SD}) yrs of age, were randomized to ingest all their prescribed hypertension medications upon awakening or ≥1 of them at bedtime. At baseline, {BP} was measured at 20-min intervals from 07:00 to 23:00 h and at 30-min intervals at night for 48 h. Physical activity was simultaneously monitored every min by wrist actigraphy to accurately determine the beginning and end of daytime activity and nocturnal sleep. Identical assessment was scheduled annually and more frequently (quarterly) if treatment adjustment was required. Despite lack of differences in ambulatory {BP} between groups at baseline, subjects ingesting medication at bedtime showed at their last available evaluation significantly lower mean sleep-time {BP}, higher sleep-time relative {BP} decline, reduced prevalence of non-dipping (34\% versus 62\%; p {\textless} .001), and higher prevalence of controlled ambulatory {BP} (62\% versus 53\%; p {\textless} .001). After a median follow-up of 5.6 yrs, subjects ingesting ≥1 {BP}-lowering medications at bedtime exhibited a significantly lower relative risk of total {CVD} events than those ingesting all medications upon awakening (0.39 [0.29-0.51]; number of events 187 versus 68; p {\textless} .001). The difference between the treatment-time groups in the relative risk of major events (including {CVD} death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke) was also highly statistically significant (0.33 [0.19-0.55]; number of events: 55 versus 18; p {\textless} .001). The progressive decrease in asleep {BP} and increase in sleep-time relative {BP} decline towards a more normal dipping pattern, two novel therapeutic targets requiring proper patient evaluation by ambulatory {BP}, were best achieved with bedtime therapy, and they were the most significant predictors of event-free survival. Bedtime chronotherapy with ≥1 {BP}-lowering medications, compared to conventional upon-waking treatment with all medications, more effectively improved {BP} control, better decreased the prevalence of non-dipping, and, most importantly, significantly reduced {CVD} morbidity and mortality.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Hypertension is one of the major risk factor for cardiovascular disease worldwide. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in China. {METHODS}: A multistage, stratified sampling method was used to obtain a representative sample of persons aged 18 years or older in the general population of China. Blood pressure ({BP}) was measured by sphygmomanometer 3 times at 5-minute intervals. Hypertension was defined as a systolic {BP} {\textgreater}/= 140mm Hg, or diastolic {BP} {\textgreater}/= 90mm Hg, or self-reported use of antihypertensive medications in the last 2 weeks irrespective of the {BP}. {RESULTS}: Altogether 50,171 subjects finished the survey across the entire country. The adjusted prevalence of hypertension was 29.6\% (95\% confidence interval ({CI}) = 28.9\%-30.4\%) and was higher among men than among women (31.2\%, 95\% {CI} = 30.1\%-32.4\%; vs. 28.0\%, 95\% {CI} = 27.0\%-29.0\%). The awareness, treatment among all hypertensive participants, control among all hypertensive participants, and control among treated hypertensive participants were 42.6\%, 34.1\%, 9.3\%, and 27.4\%, respectively. Multiple lifestyle factors were independently associated with presence of hypertension, including physical inactivity, habitual drinking, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, high body mass index, and central obesity. {CONCLUSIONS}: Hypertension is an important public health burden in China, and control of hypertension is still suboptimal. Several modifiable lifestyle activities were associated with hypertension and thus should be considered potential targets for intervention, with special attention to socioeconomically disadvantaged subpopulations in China.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: This long-term, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial, angiographic trial evaluated the effects of cholesterol lowering and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on coronary atherosclerosis in normocholesterolemic patients. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: There were a total of 460 patients: 230 received simvastatin and 230, a simvastatin placebo, and 229 received enalapril and 231, an enalapril placebo (some subjects received both drugs and some received a double placebo). Mean baseline measurements were as follows: cholesterol level, 5.20 mmol/L; triglyceride level, 1.82 mmol/L; {HDL}, 0.99 mmol/L; and {LDL}, 3.36 mmol/L. Average follow-up was 47.8 months. Changes in quantitative coronary angiographic measures between simvastatin and placebo, respectively, were as follows: mean diameters, -0.07 versus -0.14 mm (P:=0.004); minimum diameters, -0.09 versus -0.16 mm (P:=0. 0001); and percent diameter stenosis, 1.67\% versus 3.83\% (P:=0.0003). These benefits were not observed in patients on enalapril when compared with placebo. No additional benefits were seen in the group receiving both drugs. Simvastatin patients had less need for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (8 versus 21 events; P:=0.020), and fewer enalapril patients experienced the combined end point of death/myocardial infarction/stroke (16 versus 30; P:=0.043) than their respective placebo patients. {CONCLUSIONS}: This trial extends the observation of the beneficial angiographic effects of lipid-lowering therapy to normocholesterolemic patients. The implications of the neutral angiographic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition are uncertain, but they deserve further investigation in light of the positive clinical benefits suggested here and seen elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Importance: Several attempts have been made at developing models to predict 30-day readmissions in patients with heart failure, but none have sufficient discriminatory capacity for clinical use. Machine-learning ({ML}) algorithms represent a novel approach and may have potential advantages over traditional statistical modeling. Objective: To develop models using a {ML} approach to predict all-cause readmissions 30 days after discharge from a heart failure hospitalization and to compare {ML} model performance with models developed using "conventional" statistically based methods. Design, Setting, and Participants: Models were developed using {ML} algorithms, specifically, a tree-augmented naive Bayesian network, a random forest algorithm, and a gradient-boosted model and compared with traditional statistical methods using 2 independently derived logistic regression models (a de novo model and an a priori model developed using electronic health records) and a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. The study sample was randomly divided into training (70\%) and validation (30\%) sets to develop and test model performance. This was a registry-based study, and the study sample was obtained by linking patients from the Get With the Guidelines Heart Failure registry with Medicare data. After applying appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria, 56477 patients were included in our analysis. The study was conducted between January 4, 2005, and December 1, 2010, and analysis of the data was conducted between November 25, 2014, and June 30, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: C statistics were used for comparison of discriminatory capacity across models in the validation sample. Results: The overall 30-day rehospitalization rate was 21.2\% (11959 of 56477 patients). For the tree-augmented naive Bayesian network, random forest, gradient-boosted, logistic regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator models, C statistics for the validation sets were similar: 0.618, 0.607, 0.614, 0.624, and 0.618, respectively. Applying the previously validated electronic health records model to our study sample yielded a C statistic of 0.589 for the validation set. Conclusions and Relevance: Use of a number of {ML} algorithms did not improve prediction of 30-day heart failure readmissions compared with more traditional prediction models. Although there will likely be further applications of {ML} approaches in prognostic modeling, our study fits within the literature of limited predictive ability for heart failure readmissions.},

The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency of hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia amongst patients taking a thiazide diuretic in primary care. {METHODS}: A computerized search of the electronic prescribing and laboratory records of six {UK} general practices was performed. Of the 32 218 adult patients identified, 3773 had received at least one prescription for a thiazide between the years 1990 and 2002. {RESULTS}: Detailed prescribing data were available for 2942 patients of whom 951 (32.3\%) had a recorded check of their electrolytes. One hundred and ninety-six (20.6\%) had a sodium and/or potassium concentration below the normal range. The sodium distribution had a negative skew (-1.8) and in 130 (13.7\%) patients was within the hyponatraemic range. Hypokalaemia was less common, occurring in 79 (8.5\%) patients. Hyponatraemia was significantly associated with increased age; the odds ratio for developing hyponatraemia in patients over 70 years was 3.87 compared with those of {\textless} or = 70 years. Hypokalaemia was significantly associated with increased thiazide dose. {CONCLUSIONS}: Prescription of a thiazide diuretic in primary care is associated with a high frequency of hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia.

	abstract = {Previous studies with some limitations have provided equivocal results for the prognostic significance of home-measured blood pressure ({BP}). We investigated whether home-measured {BP} is more strongly associated with cardiovascular events and total mortality than is office {BP}. A prospective nationwide study was initiated in 2000 to 2001 on 2081 randomly selected subjects aged 45 to 74 years. Home and office {BP} were determined at baseline along with other cardiovascular risk factors. The primary end point was incidence of a cardiovascular event (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery). The secondary end point was total mortality. After a mean follow-up of 6.8 years, 162 subjects had experienced a cardiovascular event, and 118 subjects had died. In Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors, office {BP} (systolic/diastolic hazard ratio [{HR}] per 10/5 mm Hg increase in {BP}, 1.13/1.13; systolic/diastolic 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.05 to 1.22/1.05 to 1.22) and home {BP} ({HR}, 1.23/1.18; 95\% {CI}, 1.13 to 1.34/1.10 to 1.27) were predictive of cardiovascular events. However, when both {BPs} were simultaneously included in the models, only home {BP} ({HR}, 1.22/1.15; 95\% {CI}, 1.09 to 1.37/1.05 to 1.26), not office {BP} ({HR}, 1.01/1.06; 95\% {CI}, 0.92 to 1.12/0.97 to 1.16), was predictive of cardiovascular events. Systolic home {BP} was the sole predictor of total mortality ({HR}, 1.11; 95\% {CI}, 1.01/1.23). Our findings suggest that home-measured {BP} is prognostically superior to office {BP}.

The validity of diagnostic codes in identifying {SD}/{VA} events originating in the ambulatory setting is not well known. This study examined the positive predictive value ({PPV}) of hospitalization and emergency department encounter diagnoses in identifying {SD}/{VA} events originating in the outpatient setting. {METHODS}: We selected random samples of hospitalizations and emergency department claims with principal or first-listed discharge diagnosis codes indicative of {SD}/{VA} in individuals contributing at least 6 months of baseline time within 1999-2002 Medicaid and Medicare data from five large states. We then obtained and reviewed medical records corresponding to these events to serve as the reference standard. {RESULTS}: We identified 5239 inpatient and 29 135 emergency department events, randomly selected 100 of each, and obtained 119 medical records, 116 of which were for the requested courses of care. The {PPVs} for an outpatient-originating {SD}/{VA} precipitating hospitalization or emergency department treatment were 85.3\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 77.6-91.2) overall, 79.7\% (95\%{CI} = 68.3-88.4) for hospitalization claims, and 93.6\% (95\%{CI} = 82.5-98.7) for emergency department claims. {CONCLUSIONS}: First-listed {SD}/{VA} diagnostic codes identified in inpatient or emergency department encounters had very good agreement with clinical diagnoses and functioned well to identify outpatient-originating events. Researchers using such codes can be confident of the {PPV} when conducting studies of {SD}/{VA} originating in the outpatient setting.},

We evaluated the effect among 1411 participants in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure Lowering Arm who received spironolactone mainly as a fourth-line antihypertensive agent for uncontrolled blood pressure and who had valid {BP} measurements before and during spironolactone treatment. Among those who received spironolactone, the mean age was 63 years ({SD}: +/-8 years), 77\% were men, and 40\% had diabetes. Spironolactone was initiated a median of 3.2 years (interquartile range: 2.0 to 4.4 years) after randomization and added to a mean of 2.9 ({SD}: +/-0.9) other antihypertensive drugs. The median duration of spironolactone treatment was 1.3 years (interquartile range: 0.6 to 2.6 years). The median dose of spironolactone was 25 mg (interquartile range: 25 to 50 mg) at both the start and end of the observation period. During spironolactone therapy, mean blood pressure fell from 156.9/85.3 mm Hg ({SD}: +/-18.0/11.5 mm Hg) by 21.9/9.5 mm Hg (95\% {CI}: 20.8 to 23.0/9.0 to 10.1 mm Hg; P{\textless}0.001); the {BP} reduction was largely unaffected by age, sex, smoking, and diabetic status. Spironolactone was generally well tolerated; 6\% of participants discontinued the drug because of adverse effects. The most frequent adverse events were gynecomastia or breast discomfort and biochemical abnormalities (principally hyperkaliemia), which were recorded as adverse events in 6\% and 2\% of participants, respectively. In conclusion, spironolactone effectively lowers blood pressure in patients with hypertension uncontrolled by a mean of approximately 3 other drugs.

	abstract = {The Study on {COgnition} and Prognosis in the Elderly ({SCOPE}) assessed the effect of candesartan on cardiovascular outcomes in elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients were randomized to candesartan 8-16 mg daily (n = 2477) or placebo (n =2460). Due to extensive add-on therapy, blood pressure reduction was only about 3/2 {mmHg} greater in the candesartan group than in the control group. Nevertheless, non-fatal stroke was reduced by 28\% (p = 0.04) in the candesartan group compared to the control group, and there was a non-significant 11\% reduction in major cardiovascular events (p = 0.19). This report provides results in pre-specified subgroups of patients (age, gender, diabetes, history of stroke, smoking and cardiovascular risk at randomization). Reductions in major cardiovascular events and stroke with candesartan-based therapy were indicated in all subgroups. A significant interaction between treatment and subgroups was found for one pair of subgroups only; the reduction in major cardiovascular events with candesartan was greater in patients with a previous stroke (64\% reduction, p = 0.004) than in those without (5\% reduction, p {\textgreater} 0.20). In conclusion, this analysis indicated consistent favourable effects of candesartan-based therapy on major cardiovascular events and stroke across the different subgroups of patients. However, the benefit was particularly pronounced in patients who entered the study with a previous stroke.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year and many of these events may be preventable. Current vital sign-based risk scores for ward patients have demonstrated limited accuracy, which leads to missed opportunities to identify those patients most likely to suffer cardiac arrest and inefficient resource utilization. We derived and validated a prediction model for cardiac arrest while treating {ICU} transfer as a competing risk using electronic health record data. {DESIGN}: A retrospective cohort study. {SETTING}: An academic medical center in the United States with approximately 500 inpatient beds. {PATIENTS}: Adult patients hospitalized from November 2008 until August 2011 who had documented ward vital signs. {INTERVENTIONS}: None. {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Vital sign, demographic, location, and laboratory data were extracted from the electronic health record and investigated as potential predictor variables. A person-time multinomial logistic regression model was used to simultaneously predict cardiac arrest and {ICU} transfer. The prediction model was compared to the {VitalPAC} Early Warning Score using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and was validated using three-fold cross-validation. A total of 56,649 controls, 109 cardiac arrest patients, and 2,543 {ICU} transfers were included. The derived model more accurately detected cardiac arrest (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.88 vs 0.78; p {\textless} 0.001) and {ICU} transfer (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.77 vs 0.73; p {\textless} 0.001) than the {VitalPAC} Early Warning Score, and accuracy was similar with cross-validation. At a specificity of 93\%, our model had a higher sensitivity than the {VitalPAC} Early Warning Score for cardiac arrest patients (65\% vs 41\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: We developed and validated a prediction tool for ward patients that can simultaneously predict the risk of cardiac arrest and {ICU} transfer. Our model was more accurate than the {VitalPAC} Early Warning Score and could be implemented in the electronic health record to alert caregivers with real-time information regarding patient deterioration.},

While different variable groups showed different utility, exclusion of any particular group did not lead to a meaningfully different risk assessment. Discrete time models performed better than time-to-event models. {CONCLUSIONS}: Different variable groups were predictive over different time horizons, with vital signs most predictive for near-term mortality and demographic and comorbidities more important in long-term mortality.},

The original study was conducted between August 22, 2012, and August 28, 2013. Analysis was conducted from January 7 to June 2, 2015. {INTERVENTIONS}: Repeated 0.05-{mL} intravitreous injections of 2.0 mg of aflibercept (224 eyes), 1.25 mg of bevacizumab (218 eyes), or 0.3 mg of ranibizumab (218 eyes) as needed per protocol. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: One-year {VA} and {CST} outcomes within prespecified subgroups based on both baseline {VA} and {CST} thresholds, defined as worse (20/50 or worse) or better (20/32 to 20/40) {VA} and thicker ({\textgreater}/=400 microm) or thinner (250 to 399 microm) {CST}. {RESULTS}: In the subgroup with worse baseline {VA} (n = 305), irrespective of baseline {CST}, aflibercept showed greater improvement than bevacizumab or ranibizumab for several {VA} outcomes.

This study aimed to determine {BP} values associated with optimal {HRQoL} among younger ({\textless}65 years old) and older patients ({\textgreater}/=65 years old) treated for hypertension. {METHODS}: {HRQoL} was assessed using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey in 11,498 unselected white patients treated for hypertension for at least 12 months. {RESULTS}: {BP} values associated with highest Physical Component Summary ({PCS}) were similar for older patients and those less than 65 years old (125/80 and 125/75 {mmHg}, respectively). {BP} values associated with the highest Mental Component Summary ({MCS}) scores were slightly higher for older patients (123/80 and 115/75 {mmHg}, respectively). The scores varied depending on the number of antihypertensive drugs. Compared with patients prescribed monotherapy, {SBP} associated with the highest {PSC} scores was increased by 11 {mmHg} in patients taking two or three drugs, and by 15 {mmHg} in patients taking at least four drugs. However, {DBP} values associated with the highest {PCS} scores and {BP} values associated with the highest {MCS} scores showed little difference according to drug regimens. Results of multivariate regression analysis adjusted for {BP} control revealed that {PCS} score was more strongly associated with age, presence of multiple comorbidities and duration of antihypertensive therapy, whereas {MCS} score was more strongly associated with multiple comorbidities and number of antihypertensive drugs. {CONCLUSION}: {BP} values associated with optimal {HRQoL} are similar in younger and older patients treated for hypertension and are within the recommended goals. However, {BP} values associated with optimal {HRQoL} increase with the number of antihypertensive drugs, reflecting severity of the disease. Therefore, therapeutic goals should be individualized to prevent {HRQoL} deterioration.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Accurate blood pressure measurement is dependent on using a blood pressure cuff that is appropriate to the patient's arm circumference. {OBJECTIVE}: This study identifies the change in distribution of arm circumferences in the United States and its impact on usage of the 'standard adult' cuff. {METHOD}: The most current National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey ({NHANES}) data, available on the website (http://www.cdc.gov/nchswww/nchshome.htm), covers {NHANES} {III} (Cycle 1, 1988-1991; 8381 subjects and Cycle 2, 1991-1994; 8566 subjects) and {NHANES} 2000 (1999-2000; 4,444 subjects). The weighted change in arm circumference between {NHANES} {III} as a whole and {NHANES} 2000 was calculated. Correlates for increased arm circumference were obtained via multivariate analysis. The predicted change in blood pressure cuff usage based on the changing prevalence of arm circumferences was calculated. {RESULTS}: The mean arm circumference for the whole population increased significantly from {NHANES} {III} to {NHANES} 2000 (31.83 +/- 0.08 cm versus 32.86 +/- 0.15 cm, p {\textless} 0.001) and in the hypertension population without reaching statistical significance (33.07 +/- 0.16 to 33.61 +/- 0.30 cm, p = 0.11). When adjusted regressions were performed, the increases in arm circumference were due to increasing weight in both the whole population and the hypertensives. The numbers of Americans predicted to require the 'standard adult' cuff to accurately measure blood pressure decreased from 76.2\% to 66.3\% while the number of Americans increased from 42.2\% to 45\%. {CONCLUSIONS}: The increasing prevalence of overweight and obese Americans found in {NHANES} {III} and {NHANES} 2000 has led to larger mean arm circumferences in hypertensives and the total population. This increased frequency of larger arm circumferences predicts that the 'large adult' cuff will be increasingly required in clinician's offices for accurate blood pressure measurement.},

Using an iterative process, the aspects of data quality being measured were abstracted and categorized, as well as the methods of assessment used. {RESULTS}: Five dimensions of data quality were identified, which are completeness, correctness, concordance, plausibility, and currency, and seven broad categories of data quality assessment methods: comparison with gold standards, data element agreement, data source agreement, distribution comparison, validity checks, log review, and element presence. {DISCUSSION}: Examination of the methods by which clinical researchers have investigated the quality and suitability of {EHR} data for research shows that there are fundamental features of data quality, which may be difficult to measure, as well as proxy dimensions. Researchers interested in the reuse of {EHR} data for clinical research are recommended to consider the adoption of a consistent taxonomy of {EHR} data quality, to remain aware of the task-dependence of data quality, to integrate work on data quality assessment from other fields, and to adopt systematic, empirically driven, statistically based methods of data quality assessment. {CONCLUSION}: There is currently little consistency or potential generalizability in the methods used to assess {EHR} data quality. If the reuse of {EHR} data for clinical research is to become accepted, researchers should adopt validated, systematic methods of {EHR} data quality assessment.},

Blood pressure, quality of life, and life events were monitored. Differences between treatments were evaluated by calibrating measures of quality of life with objective life events. {RESULTS}: Throughout the treatment period, no differences were found in blood pressure, frequency of withdrawal of patients from the study, or major side effects. Patients treated with captopril had more favorable changes in overall quality of life, general perceived health, vitality, health status, sleep, and emotional control (P {\textless} 0.05 for each). The changes varied according to the quality of life at base line (P {\textless} 0.001); patients with a low quality of life at base line remained stable or improved with either drug, whereas those with a higher quality of life remained stable with captopril but worsened with enalapril. The quality-of-life scales correlated with life events and symptom distress (P {\textless} 0.001), and calibration analysis indicated that differences between treatments were clinically important. {CONCLUSIONS}: Two angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, indistinguishable according to clinical assessments of efficacy and safety, had different effects on quality of life. Calibration with life events showed that drug-induced changes are substantial and that the different effects of these two agents on quality of life can be clinically meaningful.},

We found that a naive approach approximated the gold standard, but errors on a minority of cases shifted mortality substantially.

	abstract = {Excess weight gain, especially when associated with increased visceral adiposity, is a major cause of hypertension, accounting for 65\% to 75\% of the risk for human primary (essential) hypertension. Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption impairs pressure natriuresis and plays an important role in initiating obesity hypertension. The mediators of abnormal kidney function and increased blood pressure during development of obesity hypertension include (1) physical compression of the kidneys by fat in and around the kidneys, (2) activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and (3) increased sympathetic nervous system activity. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is likely due, in part, to renal compression, as well as sympathetic nervous system activation. However, obesity also causes mineralocorticoid receptor activation independent of aldosterone or angiotensin {II}. The mechanisms for sympathetic nervous system activation in obesity have not been fully elucidated but may require leptin and activation of the brain melanocortin system. With prolonged obesity and development of target organ injury, especially renal injury, obesity-associated hypertension becomes more difficult to control, often requiring multiple antihypertensive drugs and treatment of other risk factors, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, and inflammation. Unless effective antiobesity drugs are developed, the effect of obesity on hypertension and related cardiovascular, renal and metabolic disorders is likely to become even more important in the future as the prevalence of obesity continues to increase.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Different blood pressure ({BP})-lowering drugs could have different effects on central aortic pressures and thus cardiovascular outcome despite similar effects on brachial {BP}. The Conduit Artery Function Evaluation ({CAFE}) study, a substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial ({ASCOT}), examined the impact of 2 different {BP} lowering-regimens (atenolol+/-thiazide-based versus amlodipine+/-perindopril-based therapy) on derived central aortic pressures and hemodynamics. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: The {CAFE} study recruited 2199 patients in 5 {ASCOT} centers. Radial artery applanation tonometry and pulse wave analysis were used to derive central aortic pressures and hemodynamic indexes on repeated visits for up to 4 years. Most patients received combination therapy throughout the study. Despite similar brachial systolic {BPs} between treatment groups (Delta0.7 mm Hg; 95\% {CI}, -0.4 to 1.7; P=0.2), there were substantial reductions in central aortic pressures with the amlodipine regimen (central aortic systolic {BP}, Delta4.3 mm Hg; 95\% {CI}, 3.3 to 5.4; P{\textless}0.0001; central aortic pulse pressure, Delta3.0 mm Hg; 95\% {CI}, 2.1 to 3.9; P{\textless}0.0001). Cox proportional-hazards modeling showed that central pulse pressure was significantly associated with a post hoc-defined composite outcome of total cardiovascular events/procedures and development of renal impairment in the {CAFE} cohort (unadjusted, P{\textless}0.0001; adjusted for baseline variables, P{\textless}0.05). {CONCLUSIONS}: {BP}-lowering drugs can have substantially different effects on central aortic pressures and hemodynamics despite a similar impact on brachial {BP}. Moreover, central aortic pulse pressure may be a determinant of clinical outcomes, and differences in central aortic pressures may be a potential mechanism to explain the different clinical outcomes between the 2 {BP} treatment arms in {ASCOT}.},

Accurate assessment of the non-mortality burden requires appropriate health-related quality of life and summary utility measures of which there are several contenders.

The algorithms were grouped into four classes: (i) based on the {EQ}-5D; (ii) using fewer items than those in the {SF}-12 (iii) using the items in the {SF}-12; and (iv) using all items of the {SF}-36.{\textbar}Overall health-related quality of life of the subjects was good (mean utility ranged from 0.68 (+/-0.08) to 0.85(+/-0.14) over the nine utility measures) and comparable to patients without diabetes. Summary indices were well correlated with each other (r = 0.76 to 0.99), and showed lower health-related quality of life in patients with major diabetes-related events such as stroke or myocardial infarction. Despite the smaller number of items used in the scoring of the {EQ}-5D, it generally performed at least as well as {SF}-36 based methods. However, all utility measures had some limitation such as limited range or ceiling effects.{\textbar}The summary utility measures showed good agreement, and showed good discrimination between major and minor health state changes.

We analyzed data from the {INternational} {VErapamil} {SR}-Trandolapril {STudy}, focusing on the relation between {BP} and the outcomes of 6,166 previously revascularized patients, using the 16,410 nonrevascularized patients as a reference group. The previous revascularization strategy consisted of coronary artery bypass grafting ({CABG}, 45.2\%), percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI}, 42.1\%), or both ({CABG}+{PCI}, 12.8\%). Patients who had undergone both {CABG}+{PCI} and {CABG}-only had a greater adverse outcome risk (adjusted hazard ratio 1.27\% and 1.20\%, 95\% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.53 and 1.07 to 1.35, respectively). The risk was similar for {PCI}-only patients (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04, 95\% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.19). The relations between the adjusted hazard ratio and on-treatment {BP} appeared J-shaped for each revascularization strategy, accentuated for {PCI} and diastolic {BP} ({DBP}), but excepting {CABG} only and {DBP} for which the relation was linear and positive. In conclusion, major adverse outcomes were more frequent in patients with coronary artery disease who had undergone previous {CABG}, with or without {PCI}, compared to those with previous {PCI} only. This likely reflected more severe vascular disease. The relation to systolic {BP} was J-shaped for each strategy. Among those patients with previous {CABG} only, the linear relation with {DBP} suggested that more complete revascularization might attenuate hypoperfusion at a low {DBP}. The management of {BP} might, therefore, require modification of targets according to the revascularization strategy to improve outcomes.},

We reviewed hypertension and cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment guidelines, pharmacological hypertension clinical end point trials, and blood pressure-lowering trials in blacks. Selected trials without significant black representation were considered. In this update, blacks with hypertension are divided into 2 risk strata, primary prevention, where elevated blood pressure without target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, or overt cardiovascular disease for whom blood pressure consistently {\textless}135/85 mm Hg is recommended, and secondary prevention, where elevated blood pressure with target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, and/or a history of cardiovascular disease, for whom blood pressure consistently {\textless}130/80 mm Hg is recommended. If blood pressure is {\textless}/=10 mm Hg above target levels, monotherapy with a diuretic or calcium channel blocker is preferred. When blood pressure is {\textgreater}15/10 mm Hg above target, 2-drug therapy is recommended, with either a calcium channel blocker plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker or, alternatively, in edematous and/or volume-overload states, with a thiazide diuretic plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker. Effective multidrug therapeutic combinations through 4 drugs are described. Comprehensive lifestyle modifications should be initiated in blacks when blood pressure is {\textgreater}/=115/75 mm Hg. The updated International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on hypertension management in blacks lowers the minimum target blood pressure level for the lowest-risk blacks, emphasizes effective multidrug regimens, and de-emphasizes monotherapy.},

According to guidelines, these patients have so-called resistant hypertension. The prevalence of this clinical condition is higher in tertiary than primary care centers and often is associated with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, and sleep apnea syndrome. Exclusion of pseudoresistant hypertension using ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring is a crucial step in the investigation of patients with resistant hypertension. Thus, among the multiple factors to consider when investigating patients with resistant hypertension, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be performed very early. Among other factors to consider, physicians should investigate patient adherence to therapy, assess the adequacy of treatment, exclude interfering factors, and, finally, look for secondary forms of hypertension. Poor adherence to therapy accounts for 30\% to 50\% of cases of resistance to therapy depending on the methodology used to diagnose adherence problems. This review discusses the clinical factors implicated in the pathogenesis of resistant hypertension with a particular emphasis on pseudoresistance, drug adherence, and the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for the diagnosis and management of resistant hypertension.},

The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets. {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Treating patients to lower than standard {BP} targets, {\textless}/=140-160/90-100 {mmHg}, does not reduce mortality or morbidity.

Forty-three percent of patients had had a diagnosis of {DM} for more than 10 years, and 49.7\% had had a diagnosis of hypertension for more than 10 years. Eighty-nine percent of patients had some form of medical insurance. All patients had seen their family physician providers at least once within the past year. Seventy-seven percent of patients reported high adherence as measured by the Morisky scale.

Of the 809 randomized patients, 734 had both baseline and {\textgreater} or =1 {HRQL} follow-up assessment: 95\% (379 of 397) of patients receiving candesartan and 91\% (355 of 388) of patients receiving placebo. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in least-squares mean physical component survey and mental component survey scores or the individual scales at each scheduled visit relative to baseline values (P {\textgreater}.05). In {TROPHY}, patients with prehypertension had relatively high baseline {HRQL}, and {HRQL} was maintained with the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan over both the 2-year treatment period and a total 4-year trial period.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}: Hypertensive patients are often given a calcium antagonist to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, but the benefit compared with other drug classes is controversial. {OBJECTIVE}: To determine whether initial therapy with controlled-onset extended-release ({COER}) verapamil is equivalent to a physician's choice of atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide in preventing cardiovascular disease. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: Double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted at 661 centers in 15 countries. A total of 16 602 participants diagnosed as having hypertension and who had 1 or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease were enrolled between September 1996 and December 1998 and followed up until December 31, 2000. After a mean of 3 years of follow-up, the sponsor closed the study before unblinding the results. {INTERVENTION}: Initially, 8241 participants received 180 mg of {COER} verapamil and 8361 received either 50 mg of atenolol or 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Other drugs (eg, diuretic, beta-blocker, or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) could be added in specified sequence if needed. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: First occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease-related death. {RESULTS}: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced by 13.6 mm Hg and 7.8 mm Hg for participants assigned to the {COER} verapamil group and by 13.5 and 7.1 mm Hg for partcipants assigned to the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group. There were 364 primary cardiovascular disease-related events that occurred in the {COER} verapamil group vs 365 in atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (hazard ratio [{HR}], 1.02; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.88-1.18; P =.77). For fatal or nonfatal stroke, the {HR} was 1.15 (95\% {CI}, 0.90-1.48); for fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.82 (95\% {CI}, 0.65-1.03); and for cardiovascular disease-related death, 1.09 (95\% {CI}, 0.87-1.37). The {HR} was 1.05 (95\% {CI}, 0.95-1.16) for any prespecified cardiovascular disease-related event and 1.08 (95\% {CI}, 0.93-1.26) for all-cause mortality. Nonstroke hemorrhage was more common with participants in the {COER}-verapamil group (n = 118) compared with the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (n = 79) ({HR}, 1.54 [95\% {CI}, 1.16-2.04]; P =.003). More cardiovascular disease-related events occurred between 6 {AM} and noon in both the {COER} verapamil (99/277) and atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide (88/274) groups; {HR}, 1.15 (95\% {CI}, 0.86-1.53). {CONCLUSIONS}: The {CONVINCE} trial did not demonstrate equivalence of a {COER} verapamil-based antihypertensive regimen compared with a regimen beginning with a diuretic or beta-blocker. When considered in the context of other trials of calcium antagonists, these data indicate that the effectiveness of calcium-channel therapy in reducing cardiovascular disease is similar but not better than diuretic or beta-blocker treatment.},

To accomplish this, we searched {MEDLINE}, major cardiology textbooks, meta-analyses, reviews, editorials, and the bibliographies of all identified articles. {STUDY} {SELECTION}: Only trials in which patients were randomly allocated to receive a specific therapeutic regimen or a placebo or nonplacebo control regimen were included for review. {DATA} {EXTRACTION}: Studies were abstracted for year of publication, source of support, performance location, drug therapies to which patients were randomized, use of invasive diagnostic tests or therapeutic procedures, exclusion criteria, size and demographic characteristics of the randomized study population, and principal outcome measures. {DATA} {SYNTHESIS}: A total of 214 trials met inclusion criteria, involving 150,920 study subjects. Over 60\% of trials excluded persons over the age of 75 years. Studies published after 1980 were more likely to have age-based exclusions compared with studies published before 1980 (adjusted odds ratio, 4.92; 95\% confidence interval, 2.33 to 10.54). Trials of thrombolytic therapy involving an invasive procedure were more likely to exclude elderly patients compared with other studies (adjusted odds ratio, 2.45; 95\% confidence interval, 1.10 to 5.47). Studies with age-based exclusions had a smaller percentage of women compared with those without such exclusions (18\% vs 23\%; P = .0002), with the mean age of the study population significantly associated with the proportion of women participants (P = .0001, R2 = .29). {CONCLUSIONS}: Age-based exclusions are frequently used in clinical trials of medications used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Such exclusions limit the ability to generalize study findings to the patient population that experiences the most morbidity and mortality from acute myocardial infarction.},

The appropriate data were meta-analysed using Revman 5.0. {RESULTS}: Twenty-six trials including 6108 patients were identified. The treatment with beta blockers has significantly decreased all-cause mortality when compared with no control ({OR} 0.40, 95\% {CI} 0.20 to 0.79), but has had no statistically differences when compared with placebo ({OR} 0.92, 95\% {CI} 0.62 to 1.38) and with calcium-channel blocker ({CCB}) ({OR}0.84, 95\% {CI} 0.49 to 1.44). This was similar in patients with fatal and non-fatal acute myocardial infarction when compared with placebo ({OR} 0.82, 95\% {CI} 0.57 to 1.17) or {CCB} ({OR} 1.08, 95\% {CI} 0.71 to 1.66); on revascularization and quality of life. The beta blockers reduced the incident of unstable angina compared to no treatment ({OR} 0.14, 95\% {CI}0.07 to 0.29), but increased unstable angina compared to placebo ({OR} 3.32, 95\% {CI} 1.50 to 7.36). There was a significant reduction of nitrate consumption when beta blockers were compared with {CCBs} ({OR} 1.18, 95\% {CI} 1.54 to 0.82),but not with placebo and trimetazidine. There was no significant difference in angina attack between each group. Side effects in beta blocker were similar with ones in controls. {CONCLUSIONS}: Beta blockers may decrease the death and unstable angina when compared with no treatment, but no more effective than other anti-anginal agents on prophylaxis of myocardial ischaemia in stable angina patients.},

Model performance was tested by c statistics in the derivation and validation cohorts and according to postadmission treatment (ie, invasive and antithrombotic therapy). The {CRUSADE} bleeding score (range 1 to 100 points) was created by assignment of weighted integers that corresponded to the coefficient of each variable. The rate of major bleeding increased by bleeding risk score quintiles: 3.1\% for those at very low risk (score {\textless} or = 20); 5.5\% for those at low risk (score 21-30); 8.6\% for those at moderate risk (score 31-40); 11.9\% for those at high risk (score 41-50); and 19.5\% for those at very high risk (score {\textgreater}50; P(trend) {\textless}0.001). The c statistics for the major bleeding model (derivation=0.72 and validation=0.71) and risk score (derivation=0.71 and validation=0.70) were similar.

Home blood pressure ({BP}) monitoring has the potential to improve hypertension control. The purpose of this review was to quantify both the magnitude and mechanisms of benefit of home {BP} monitoring on {BP} reduction. Using a structured review, studies were selected if they reported either changes in {BP} or percentage of participants achieving a pre-established {BP} goal between randomized groups using home-based and office-based {BP} measurements. A random-effects model was used to estimate the magnitude of benefit and relative risk. The search yielded 37 randomized controlled trials with 9446 participants that contributed data for this meta-analysis. Compared with clinic-based measurements (control group), systolic {BP} improved with home-based {BP} monitoring (-2.63 mm Hg; 95\% {CI}, -4.24, -1.02); diastolic {BP} also showed improvement (-1.68 mm Hg; 95\% {CI}, -2.58, -0.79). Reductions in home {BP} monitoring-based therapy were greater when telemonitoring was used. Home {BP} monitoring led to more frequent antihypertensive medication reductions (relative risk, 2.02 [95\% {CI}, 1.32 to 3.11]) and was associated with less therapeutic inertia defined as unchanged medication despite elevated {BP} (relative risk for unchanged medication, 0.82 [95\% {CI}, 0.68 to 0.99]). Compared with clinic {BP} monitoring alone, home {BP} monitoring has the potential to overcome therapeutic inertia and lead to a small but significant reduction in systolic and diastolic {BP}. Hypertension control with home {BP} monitoring can be enhanced further when accompanied by plans to monitor and treat elevated {BP} such as through telemonitoring.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: While behavioral interventions may be viewed as important strategies to improve blood pressure ({BP}), an evidence-based review of studies evaluating these interventions may help to guide clinical practice. {METHODS}: We employed systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature (1970-1999) to assess the independent and additive effects of three behavioral interventions on {BP} control (counseling, self-monitoring of {BP}, and structured training courses). {RESULTS}: Of 232 articles assessing behavioral interventions, 15 (4072 subjects) evaluated the effectiveness of patient-centered counseling, patient self-monitoring of {BP}, and structured training courses. Pooled results revealed that counseling was favored over usual care (3.2 {mmHg} [95\% {CI}, 1.2-5.3] improvement in diastolic blood pressure [{DBP}] and 11.1 {mmHg} [95\% {CI}, 4.1-18.1] improvement in systolic blood pressure [{SBP}]) and training courses (10 {mmHg} improvement in {DBP} [95\% {CI}, 4.8-15.6]). Counseling plus training was favored over counseling (4.7 {mmHg} improvement in {SBP} [95\% {CI}, 1.2-8.2]) and afforded more subjects hypertension control (95\% [95\% {CI}, 87-99]) than those receiving counseling (51\% [95\% {CI}, 34-66]) or training alone (64\% [95\% {CI}, 48-77]). {CONCLUSIONS}: Evidence suggests that counseling offers {BP} improvement over usual care, and that adding structured training courses to counseling may further improve {BP}. However, there is not enough evidence to conclude whether self-monitoring of {BP} or training courses alone offer consistent improvement in {BP} over counseling or usual care. The magnitude of {BP} reduction offered by counseling indicates this may be an important adjunct to pharmacologic therapy.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In 2008, the United States spent \$2.2 trillion for healthcare, which was 15.5\% of its {GDP}. 31\% of this expenditure is attributed to hospital care. Evidently, even modest reductions in hospital care costs matter. A 2009 study showed that nearly \$30.8 billion in hospital care cost during 2006 was potentially preventable, with heart diseases being responsible for about 31\% of that amount. {METHODS}: Our goal is to accurately and efficiently predict heart-related hospitalizations based on the available patient-specific medical history. To the best of our knowledge, the approaches we introduce are novel for this problem. The prediction of hospitalization is formulated as a supervised classification problem. We use de-identified Electronic Health Record ({EHR}) data from a large urban hospital in Boston to identify patients with heart diseases. Patients are labeled and randomly partitioned into a training and a test set. We apply five machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines ({SVM}), {AdaBoost} using trees as the weak learner, logistic regression, a naive Bayes event classifier, and a variation of a Likelihood Ratio Test adapted to the specific problem. Each model is trained on the training set and then tested on the test set. {RESULTS}: All five models show consistent results, which could, to some extent, indicate the limit of the achievable prediction accuracy. Our results show that with under 30\% false alarm rate, the detection rate could be as high as 82\%. These accuracy rates translate to a considerable amount of potential savings, if used in practice.},

Regression modeling suffers from a number of limitations, including bias introduced by commonly used variable selection methods. We illustrate the value of an intuitive, robust approach to variable selection, random survival forests ({RSF}), in a large clinical cohort. {RSF} are a potentially powerful extensions of classification and regression trees, with lower variance and bias. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We studied 2231 adult patients with systolic heart failure who underwent cardiopulmonary stress testing. During a mean follow-up of 5 years, 742 patients died. Thirty-nine demographic, cardiac and noncardiac comorbidity, and stress testing variables were analyzed as potential predictors of all-cause mortality. An {RSF} of 2000 trees was constructed, with each tree constructed on a bootstrap sample from the original cohort. The most predictive variables were defined as those near the tree trunks (averaged over the forest). The {RSF} identified peak oxygen consumption, serum urea nitrogen, and treadmill exercise time as the 3 most important predictors of survival. The {RSF} predicted survival similarly to a conventional Cox proportional hazards model (out-of-bag C-index of 0.705 for {RSF} versus 0.698 for Cox proportional hazards model). {CONCLUSIONS}: An {RSF} model in a cohort of patients with heart failure performed as well as a traditional Cox proportional hazard model and may serve as a more intuitive approach for clinicians to identify important risk factors for all-cause mortality.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: This study examined the extent to which areal socio-economic gradients in all-cause and cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) mortality among {US} men and women aged 25-64 years increased between 1969 and 1998. {METHODS}: Using factor analysis 17 census tract variables were used to develop an areal index of socio-economic status that was used to stratify all {US} counties into five socio-economic categories. By linking the index to county-level mortality data from 1969 to 1998, we calculated annual age-adjusted mortality rates for each area socio-economic group. Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate areal socio-economic gradients in mortality over time. {RESULTS}: Areal socio-economic gradients in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality have increased substantially over the past three decades. Compared to men in the highest area socio-economic group, rates of all-cause and {CVD} mortality among men in the lowest area socio-economic group were 42\% and 30\% greater in 1969-1970 and 73\% and 79\% greater in 1997-1998, respectively. The gradients in mortality among women were steeper for {CVD} than for all causes. Compared to women in the highest area socio-economic group, rates of all-cause and {CVD} mortality among women in the lowest area socio-economic group were 29\% and 49\% greater in 1969-1970 and 53\% and 94\% greater in 1997-1998, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS}: Although {US} all-cause and cardiovascular mortality declined for all area socio-economic groups during 1969-1998, the gradient increased because of significantly larger mortality declines in the higher socio-economic groups. Increasing areal inequalities in mortality shown here may be related to increasing temporal differences in the material and social living conditions between areas.},

	abstract = {Although mortality after myocardial infarction ({MI}) has declined in the United States in recent decades, there have been few community-based investigations of the long-term trends in the incidence of heart failure after {MI}, and their results appear to be conflicting.{\textbar}We evaluated 676 Framingham Heart Study participants between 45 and 85 years of age (mean age 67 years, 34\% women) who developed a first {MI} between 1970 and 1999. We assessed the incidence rates of heart failure and of death without heart failure in each of 3 decades (1970 to 1979, 1980 to 1989, and 1990 to 1999). We estimated the multivariable-adjusted risk of events in the latter 2 decades, with the period 1970 to 1979 serving as the referent. The 30-day incidence of heart failure after {MI} rose from 10\% in 1970 to 1979 to 23.1\% in 1990 to 1999 (P for trend 0.003), whereas 30-day mortality after {MI} declined from 12.2\% (1970 to 1979) to 4.1\% (1990 to 1999). The 5-year incidence of heart failure after {MI} rose from 27.6\% in 1970 to 1979 to 31.9\% in 1990 to 1999 (P for trend 0.02), whereas 5-year mortality after {MI} declined from 41.1\% (1970 to 1979) to 17.3\% (1990 to 1999). In multivariable analyses, compared with the period 1970 to 1979, we observed higher 30-day (risk ratio 2.05, 95\% confidence interval 1.25 to 3.36) and 5-year (risk ratio 1.74, 95\% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.84) risks of heart failure in the decade 1990 to 1999. These trends were accompanied by lower 30-day (risk ratio 0.21, 95\% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.47) and 5-year (risk ratio 0.31, 95\% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.54) mortality rates in 1990 to 1999.{\textbar}In the present community-based sample, we observed an increase in the incidence of heart failure in recent decades that paralleled the decrease in mortality after {MI}.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between a psychometric health-related quality-of-life instrument (the {SF}-36)-and two health utility measures [the time trade-off ({TTO}) and rating scale ({RS}) methods) among hypertensives in a general population. In the analyses were adjusted for comorbidity. The study was based on a postal questionnaire that was sent to a random sample of 8000 inhabitants aged 20-84 years (response rate 68\%) in Uppsala County, Sweden, in 1995. The results showed only a moderate correlation between the {TTO} and the {RS} methods. The different dimensions of {SF}-36 were overall lower correlated with the {TTO} method than with the {RS} method. Co-morbidity was not associated with the {RS} or the {TTO} method among hypertensives. The regression equations explained 58\% of the variance in {RS} among hypertensives. The corresponding value for the {TTO} method was about 20\%. In conclusion, our study found that among hypertensives the {SF}-36 is low to moderate correlated to the {TTO} and {RS} methods. Health utilities and psychometric measures represent different attributes of health. It is therefore important to be aware of the differences between psychometric and utility measures when interpreting results from studies using different methods. More work is needed to explicate if health utilities can be obtained from the {SF}-36.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To evaluate the validity of patient report, pharmacy dispensing records, and pill counts as measures of antihypertensive adherence using electronic monitoring as the validation standard. {METHODS}: The study was conducted among 286 members of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a managed care organization, who were at least 18 years of age, on monotherapy for hypertension, and had prescription drug coverage. Prescription refill adherence during the 12 months before enrollment was determined from their automated pharmacy dispensing records. Participants were interviewed about their medication adherence before and after a 3-month electronic monitoring period during which pill counts were also performed. Adherence to both recommended number and timing of doses was estimated from electronic monitoring data. Data analysis was based on statistical correlation and analysis of variance. {RESULTS}: Electronic adherence monitoring revealed that the proportion of prescribed doses consumed was higher (0.92) than the proportion of doses taken on time (0.63). The correlation between adherence to quantity and timing of doses was 0.32. Concurrent pill counts and earlier refilling patterns were moderately correlated with electronic monitoring (pill count: r = .52 with quantity and r = .17 with timing; refill adherence r = .32 with quantity and r = .22 with timing). There was considerable misclassification of adherence reported by patients, although nonadherence was generally accurately reported. {CONCLUSIONS}: Deviation from recommended timing of doses appears to be greater than from prescribed number of doses. Pharmacy dispensing records demonstrate predictive validity as measures of cumulative exposure and gaps in medication supply. Adherence levels determined from pill counts and pharmacy dispensing records correlate more closely with quantity than with timing of doses. Nonadherence reported by patients can serve as a qualitative indicator and predictor of reduced adherence.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: A number of potential determinants of medication non-adherence have been described so far. However, the heterogenic quality of existing publications poses the need for the use of a rigorous methodology in building a list of such determinants. The purpose of this study was a systematic review of current research on determinants of patient adherence on the basis of a recently agreed European consensus taxonomy and terminology. {METHODS}: {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, {CINAHL}, Cochrane Library, {IPA}, and {PsycINFO} were systematically searched for systematic reviews published between 2000/01/01 and 2009/12/31 that provided determinants on non-adherence to medication. The searches were limited to reviews having adherence to medication prescribed by health professionals for outpatient as a major topic. {RESULTS}: Fifty-one reviews were included in this review, covering 19 different disease categories. In these reviews, exclusively assessing non-adherence to chronic therapies, 771 individual factor items were identified, of which most were determinants of implementation, and only 47-determinants of persistence with medication. Factors with an unambiguous effect on adherence were further grouped into 8 clusters of socio-economic-related factors, 6 of healthcare team- and system-related factors, 6 of condition-related factors, 6 of therapy-related factors, and 14 of patient-related factors. The lack of standardized definitions and use of poor measurement methods resulted in many inconsistencies. {CONCLUSIONS}: This study provides clear evidence that medication non-adherence is affected by multiple determinants. Therefore, the prediction of non-adherence of individual patients is difficult, and suitable measurement and multifaceted interventions may be the most effective answer toward unsatisfactory adherence. The limited number of publications assessing determinants of persistence with medication, and lack of those providing determinants of adherence to short-term treatment identify areas for future research.},

This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to assess the effect of {NSAID} therapy on blood pressure control in stable hypertensive patients treated with a calcium channel blocker. One hundred patients with stable blood pressure control on 30 mg nicardipine three times a day were treated with 375 mg naproxen twice a day or placebo for 4 weeks. The mean diastolic blood pressures and estimated mean arterial pressures in both groups changed {\textless} 1 mm Hg during the 4 weeks of study drug treatment. None of the changes was significantly different from baseline and the two treatment groups were not significantly different from each other. Body weight in the placebo-treated patients did not change significantly whereas body weight in the naproxen-treated patients increased significantly, from 90.3 +/- 3.2 kg to 91.0 +/- 3.2 kg (mean = 0.7, P = .0003). At 4 weeks there was a mean loss of 0.1 kg in the placebo group and a mean gain of 0.4 kg in the naproxen group compared to baseline weights, neither of which was statistically significant (P = .60 and P = .071, respectively). These results indicate that despite a significant increase in body weight, the antihypertensive action of the calcium channel blocker nicardipine is not significantly affected by cotreatment with naproxen.},

Symplicity {HTN}-2, a multicenter, randomized trial, demonstrated that catheter-based renal denervation produced significant blood pressure lowering in treatment-resistant patients at 6 months after the procedure compared with control, medication-only patients. Longer-term follow-up, including 6-month crossover results, is now presented. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Eligible patients were on ≥3 antihypertensive drugs and had a baseline systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg (≥150 mm Hg for type 2 diabetics). After the 6-month primary end point was met, renal denervation in control patients was permitted. One-year results on patients randomized to immediate renal denervation (n=47) and 6-month postprocedure results for crossover patients are presented. At 12 months after the procedure, the mean fall in office systolic blood pressure in the initial renal denervation group (-28.1 mm Hg; 95\% confidence interval, -35.4 to -20.7; P{\textless}0.001) was similar to the 6-month fall (-31.7 mm Hg; 95\% confidence interval, -38.3 to -25.0; P=0.16 versus 6-month change).

In the crossover group, there was 1 renal artery dissection during guide catheter insertion, before denervation, corrected by renal artery stenting, and 1 hypotensive episode, which resolved with medication adjustment. {CONCLUSIONS}: Control patients who crossed over to renal denervation with the Symplicity system had a significant drop in blood pressure similar to that observed in patients receiving immediate denervation.

We seek to investigate the trends in incidence of hypertension and control of incident hypertension among Chinese adults during 1991-1997 and 2004-2009. {METHODS}: Within the China Health and Nutrition Survey (1991-2009), we identified five cohorts of adults (age{\textgreater}/=18years) who were free of hypertension at baseline of each cohort: cohorts 1991-1997 (n=4107), 1993-2000 (n=4068), 1997-2004 (n=4141), 2000-2006 (n=4695), and 2004-2009 (n=4523). Data on demographics, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, body mass index ({BMI}), and blood pressure were collected through interviews and clinical examination. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure{\textgreater}/=140/90mmHg or currently using antihypertensive drugs. Multiple generalized estimation equations and Coxregression models were used to test the trends in blood pressure, incidence of hypertension, use of antihypertensive drugs, and control status of incident hypertension. {RESULTS}: After controlling for potential confounders, incidence of hypertension (per 100 person-years) significantly increased from 2.9 in 1991-1997 to 5.3 in 2004-2009 (ptrend=0.024); the linear trend was statistically or marginally significant in the age group of 18-39 years, in women, in rural residents, and in adults with normal {BMI}. The overall rates of antihypertensive treatment and control of incident hypertension increased significantly from 5.7\% and 1.7\% in 1991-1997 to 19.9\% and 7.6\% in 2004-2009, respectively (ptrend{\textless}0.001). {CONCLUSIONS}: The incidence of hypertension has increased in Chinese adults since early 1990s.

One source of comparative data is the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, which randomly assigned 8012 hypertensive men to special intervention ({SI}) or usual care. {SI} participants could use {CTD} or {HCTZ} initially; previous analyses have grouped clinics by their main diuretic used (C-clinics: {CTD}; H-clinics: {HCTZ}). After 48 months, {SI} participants receiving {HCTZ} were recommended to switch to {CTD}, in part because higher mortality was observed for {SI} compared with usual care participants in H-clinics, whereas the opposite was found in C-clinics. In this analysis, we examined change in continuous measures of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy using both an ecological analysis by previously reported C- or H-clinic groupings and an individual participant analysis where use of {CTD} or {HCTZ} by {SI} participants was considered and updated annually. Through 48 months, differences between {SI} and usual care in left ventricular hypertrophy were larger for C-clinics compared with H-clinics (Sokolow-Lyon: -93.9 versus -54.9 μV, P=0.049; Cornell voltage: -68.1 versus -35.9 μV, P=0.019; Cornell voltage product: -4.6 versus -2.2 μV/ms, P=0.071; left ventricular mass: -4.4 versus -2.8 g, P=0.002). At the individual participant level, Sokolow-Lyon and left ventricular mass were significantly lower for {SI} men receiving {CTD} compared with {HCTZ} through 48 months and 84 months of follow-up. Our findings on left ventricular hypertrophy support the idea that greater blood pressure reduction with {CTD} than {HCTZ} may have led to differences in mortality observed in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial.},

The planned widespread implementation of {EHRs} brings the promise of abundant data resources for prediction purposes. The three specific aims of our research are: (1) to develop an {EHR}-based automated algorithm to predict the need for Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ({PICU}) transfer in the first 24h of admission; (2) to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm on a held-out test data set; and (3) to compare the effectiveness of the new algorithm's with those of two published Pediatric Early Warning Scores ({PEWS}). {METHODS}: The cases were comprised of 526 encounters with 24-h Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ({PICU}) transfer. In addition to the cases, we randomly selected 6772 control encounters from 62516 inpatient admissions that were never transferred to the {PICU}. We used 29 variables in a logistic regression and compared our algorithm against two published {PEWS} on a held-out test data set. {RESULTS}: The logistic regression algorithm achieved 0.849 (95\% {CI} 0.753-0.945) sensitivity, 0.859 (95\% {CI} 0.850-0.868) specificity and 0.912 (95\% {CI} 0.905-0.919) area under the curve ({AUC}) in the test set. Our algorithm's {AUC} was significantly higher, by 11.8 and 22.6\% in the test set, than two published {PEWS}. {CONCLUSION}: The novel algorithm achieved higher sensitivity, specificity, and {AUC} than the two {PEWS} reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Preventing the occurrence of hospital readmissions is needed to improve quality of care and foster population health across the care continuum. Hospitals are being held accountable for improving transitions of care to avert unnecessary readmissions. Advocate Health Care in Chicago and Cerner ({ACC}) collaborated to develop all-cause, 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction models to identify patients that need interventional resources. Ideally, prediction models should encompass several qualities: they should have high predictive ability; use reliable and clinically relevant data; use vigorous performance metrics to assess the models; be validated in populations where they are applied; and be scalable in heterogeneous populations. However, a systematic review of prediction models for hospital readmission risk determined that most performed poorly (average C-statistic of 0.66) and efforts to improve their performance are needed for widespread usage. {METHODS}: The {ACC} team incorporated electronic health record data, utilized a mixed-method approach to evaluate risk factors, and externally validated their prediction models for generalizability. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied on the patient cohort and then split for derivation and internal validation. Stepwise logistic regression was performed to develop two predictive models: one for admission and one for discharge. The prediction models were assessed for discrimination ability, calibration, overall performance, and then externally validated. {RESULTS}: The {ACC} Admission and Discharge Models demonstrated modest discrimination ability during derivation, internal and external validation post-recalibration (C-statistic of 0.76 and 0.78, respectively), and reasonable model fit during external validation for utility in heterogeneous populations. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {ACC} Admission and Discharge Models embody the design qualities of ideal prediction models. The {ACC} plans to continue its partnership to further improve and develop valuable clinical models.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}: For patients with chronic disease, there is growing interest in "self-management" programs that emphasize the patients' central role in managing their illness. A recent randomized clinical trial demonstrated the potential of self-management to improve health status and reduce health care utilization in patients with chronic diseases. {OBJECTIVE}: To evaluate outcomes of a chronic disease self-management program in a real-world" setting. {STUDY} {DESIGN}: Before-after cohort study. {PATIENTS} {AND} {SETTING}: Of the 613 patients from various Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics recruited for the study, 489 had complete baseline and follow-up data. {INTERVENTION}: The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program is a 7-week, small-group intervention attended by people with different chronic conditions. It is taught largely by peer instructors from a highly structured manual. The program is based on self-efficacy theory and emphasizes problem solving, decision making, and confidence building. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Health behavior, self-efficacy (confidence in ability to deal with health problems), health status, and health care utilization, assessed at baseline and at 12 months by self-administered questionnaires. {RESULTS}: At 1 year, participants in the program experienced statistically significant improvements in health behaviors (exercise, cognitive symptom management, and communication with physicians), self-efficacy, and health status (fatigue, shortness of breath, pain, role function, depression, and health distress) and had fewer visits to the emergency department ({ED}) (0.4 visits in the 6 months prior to baseline, compared with 0.3 in the 6 months prior to follow-up; P = 0.05). There were slightly fewer outpatient visits to physicians and fewer days in hospital, but the differences were not statistically significant. Results were of about the same magnitude as those observed in a previous randomized, controlled trial. Program costs were estimated to be about \$200 per participant. {CONCLUSIONS}: We replicated the results of our previous clinical trial of a chronic disease self-management program in a "real-world" setting. One year after exposure to the program, most patients experienced statistically significant improvements in a variety of health outcomes and had fewer {ED} visits.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors such as captopril reduce mortality and cardiovascular morbidity among patients with myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular systolic dysfunction, heart failure, or both. In a double-blind trial, we compared the effect of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan, the {ACE} inhibitor captopril, and the combination of the two on mortality in this population of patients. {METHODS}: Patients receiving conventional therapy were randomly assigned, 0.5 to 10 days after acute myocardial infarction, to additional therapy with valsartan (4909 patients), valsartan plus captopril (4885 patients), or captopril (4909 patients). The primary end point was death from any cause. {RESULTS}: During a median follow-up of 24.7 months, 979 patients in the valsartan group died, as did 941 patients in the valsartan-and-captopril group and 958 patients in the captopril group (hazard ratio in the valsartan group as compared with the captopril group, 1.00; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.11; P=0.98; hazard ratio in the valsartan-and-captopril group as compared with the captopril group, 0.98; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.09; P=0.73). The upper limit of the one-sided 97.5 percent confidence interval for the comparison of the valsartan group with the captopril group was within the prespecified margin for noninferiority with regard to mortality (P=0.004) and with regard to the composite end point of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (P{\textless}0.001). The valsartan-and-captopril group had the most drug-related adverse events. With monotherapy, hypotension and renal dysfunction were more common in the valsartan group, and cough, rash, and taste disturbance were more common in the captopril group. {CONCLUSIONS}: Valsartan is as effective as captopril in patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction. Combining valsartan with captopril increased the rate of adverse events without improving survival.},

The medication compliance of 105 patients receiving antihypertensive medications was monitored by analyzing data obtained from special pill containers that electronically record the date and time of medication removal. Inaccurate compliance estimates derived using the simple pill count method were thereby avoided. Compliance was defined as the percent of days during which the prescribed number of doses were removed. Compliance improved from 59.0\% on a three-time daily regimen to 83.6\% on a once-daily regimen. Thus, compliance improves dramatically as prescribed dose frequency decreases. Probably the single most important action that health care providers can take to improve compliance is to select medications that permit the lowest daily prescribed dose frequency.},

A review and meta-analysis of studies investigating the association of home {BP} measurements with target organ damage was performed. {METHODS}: A {PubMed} and Cochrane Library search (1950-2011) revealed 23 studies reporting comparative data of home {BP} versus ambulatory and/or office measurements in terms of their association with several indices of target organ damage. Correlation coefficients were pooled by random-effects model meta-analysis. {RESULTS}: Fourteen studies (n = 2485) assessing echocardiographic left ventricular mass index ({LVMI}) showed similar correlations with home (coefficients r = 0.46/0.28, systolic/diastolic) as with ambulatory {BP} (0.37/0.26, P = {NS} for difference versus home {BP}), and superior to office measurements (r = 0.23/0.19, P {\textless} 0.001/0.009 for difference versus home {BP}). Four methodologically heterogeneous studies assessing the glomerular filtration rate (n = 609) could not be pooled or lead to a concrete result. Four studies assessing carotid intima-media thickness (n = 1222), three assessing pulse wave velocity (n = 720) and two assessing urinary protein excretion (n = 156) showed no difference in pooled correlation coefficients with home versus office {BP} measurements. With all the measurement methods {SBP} was more closely associated with target organ damage than {DBP}. {CONCLUSION}: These data suggest that home {BP} is as good as ambulatory monitoring and superior to office measurements in regard to their association with preclinical organ damage assessed by echocardiographic {LVMI}. More research is required to evaluate the relationship of home {BP} with other indices of target organ damage.},

Recent definitions also include controlled blood pressure with use of 4 or more medications as also being resistant to treatment. Recently, refractory hypertension, an extreme phenotype of antihypertensive treatment failure has been defined as hypertension uncontrolled with use of 5 or more antihypertensive agents, including a long-acting thiazide diuretic and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Patients with resistant vs refractory hypertension share similar characteristics and comorbidities, including obesity, African American race, female sex, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Patients with refractory vs resistant hypertension tend to be younger and are more likely to have been diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Refractory hypertension might also differ from resistant hypertension in terms of underlying cause. Preliminary evidence suggests that refractory hypertension is more likely to be neurogenic in etiology (ie, heightened sympathetic tone), vs a volume-dependent hypertension that is more characteristic of resistant hypertension in general.},

We developed a cardiac arrest risk triage score to predict cardiac arrest and compared it to the Modified Early Warning Score, a commonly cited rapid response team activation criterion. {DESIGN}: A retrospective cohort study. {SETTING}: An academic medical center in the United States. {PATIENTS}: All patients hospitalized from November 2008 to January 2011 who had documented ward vital signs were included in the study. These patients were divided into three cohorts: patients who suffered a cardiac arrest on the wards, patients who had a ward to intensive care unit transfer, and patients who had neither of these outcomes (controls). {INTERVENTIONS}: None. {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Ward vital signs from admission until discharge, intensive care unit transfer, or ward cardiac arrest were extracted from the medical record. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict cardiac arrest, and the cardiac arrest risk triage score was calculated using the regression coefficients. The model was validated by comparing its accuracy for detecting intensive care unit transfer to the Modified Early Warning Score. Each patient's maximum score prior to cardiac arrest, intensive care unit transfer, or discharge was used to compare the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves between the two models. Eighty-eight cardiac arrest patients, 2,820 intensive care unit transfers, and 44,519 controls were included in the study. The cardiac arrest risk triage score more accurately predicted cardiac arrest than the Modified Early Warning Score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.84 vs. 0.76; p = .001). At a specificity of 89.9\%, the cardiac arrest risk triage score had a sensitivity of 53.4\% compared to 47.7\% for the Modified Early Warning Score. The cardiac arrest risk triage score also predicted intensive care unit transfer better than the Modified Early Warning Score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.71 vs. 0.67; p {\textless} .001). {CONCLUSIONS}: The cardiac arrest risk triage score is simpler and more accurately detected cardiac arrest and intensive care unit transfer than the Modified Early Warning Score. Implementation of this tool may decrease rapid response team resource utilization and provide a better opportunity to improve patient outcomes than the modified early warning score.},

	abstract = {We present results that allow the researcher in certain cases to determine the direction of the bias that arises when control for confounding is inadequate. The results are given within the context of the directed acyclic graph causal framework and are stated in terms of signed edges. Rigorous definitions for signed edges are provided. We describe cases in which intuition concerning signed edges fails and we characterize the directed acyclic graphs that researchers can use to draw conclusions about the sign of the bias of unmeasured confounding. If there is only one unmeasured confounding variable on the graph, then nonincreasing or nondecreasing average causal effects suffice to draw conclusions about the direction of the bias. When there are more than one unmeasured confounding variable, nonincreasing and nondecreasing average causal effects can be used to draw conclusions only if the various unmeasured confounding variables are independent of one another conditional on the measured covariates. When this conditional independence property does not hold, stronger notions of monotonicity are needed to draw conclusions about the direction of the bias.},

The extent to which women and men with newly identified hypertension are at a similar risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including chronic kidney disease ({CKD}), is not well known. {METHODS}: Among women and men with incident hypertension from 2001 to 2006 enrolled in the Cardiovascular Research Network ({CVRN}) Hypertension Registry, we compared incident events including all-cause death; hospitalization for myocardial infarction ({MI}), heart failure or stroke; and the development of {CKD}. Multivariable models were adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. {RESULTS}: Among 177,521 patients with incident hypertension, 55\% were women. Compared with men, women were older, more likely white and had more kidney disease at baseline. Over median 3.2 years (interquartile range 1.6-4.8) of follow-up, after adjustment, women were equally likely to be hospitalized for heart failure [hazard ratio 0.90, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.76-1.07] and were significantly less likely to die of any cause (hazard ratio 0.85, 95\% {CI} 0.80-0.90) or be hospitalized for {MI} (hazard ratio 0.44, 95\% {CI} 0.39-0.50) or stroke (hazard ratio 0.68, 95\% {CI} 0.60-0.77) compared with men.

Complex multivariable models identify independent predictors and quantify their relative contribution to mortality risk but are too cumbersome to be readily applied in clinical practice. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We developed and evaluated a convenient bedside clinical risk score for predicting 30-day mortality at presentation of fibrinolytic-eligible patients with {STEMI}. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction ({TIMI}) risk score for {STEMI} was created as the simple arithmetic sum of independent predictors of mortality weighted according to the adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression analysis in the Intravenous {nPA} for Treatment of Infarcting Myocardium Early {II} trial (n=14 114). Mean 30-day mortality was 6.7\%. Ten baseline variables, accounting for 97\% of the predictive capacity of the multivariate model, constituted the {TIMI} risk score. The risk score showed a {\textgreater}40-fold graded increase in mortality, with scores ranging from 0 to {\textgreater}8 (P:{\textless}0.0001); mortality was {\textless}1\% among patients with a score of 0. The prognostic discriminatory capacity of the {TIMI} risk score was comparable to the full multivariable model (c statistic 0. 779 versus 0.784). The prognostic performance of the risk score was stable over multiple time points (1 to 365 days). External validation in the {TIMI} 9 trial showed similar prognostic capacity (c statistic 0.746). {CONCLUSIONS}: The {TIMI} risk score for {STEMI} captures the majority of prognostic information offered by a full logistic regression model but is more readily used at the bedside.

Using data from 1999-2004, we compared the {DASH} score among demographic groups in age- and energy-adjusted models and modeled the odds of a {DASH}-accordant dietary pattern ({\textgreater}or=4.5) using multivariable logistic regression. The {DASH} score, {DASH} accordance, and percentage of participants achieving individual targets were compared with estimates from {NHANES} 1988-1994 data. {RESULTS}: Based on 4386 participants with known {HTN} in the recent survey period (1999-2004), the mean ({SE}) {DASH} score, after adjustment for age and energy intake, was 2.92 (0.05), with 19.4\% (1.2\%) classified as {DASH} accordant.

It is more common in women. The mechanism may involve accumulation of prostaglandins, kinins (such as bradykinin), or substance P (neurotransmitter present in respiratory tract C-fibers); both bradykinin and substance P are degraded by {ACE}. A 4-day trial of withdrawal of the {ACE} inhibitor or temporary substitution of another class of antihypertensive agent inexpensively and easily ascertains if the {ACE} inhibitor caused the cough. Change to another {ACE} inhibitor or additive therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not recommended. Prompt recognition of {ACE} inhibitor-related cough can prevent unnecessary diagnostic testing and treatment. Angioedema occurs in 0.1\% to 0.2\% of patients receiving {ACE} inhibitors. The onset usually occurs within hours or, at most, 1 week after starting therapy. The mechanism may involve autoantibodies, bradykinin, or complement-system components. Treatment involves first protecting the airway, followed by epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids if needed. Therapy is then resumed with an alternate class of antihypertensive agent.},

	abstract = {The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system appears to be one of the key factors in the development of hypertensive vascular disease. Identification of mineralocorticoid receptors in the heart, vasculature, and brain has raised speculation that aldosterone may directly mediate its detrimental effects in these target organs independent of angiotensin {II}. Aldosterone increases vascular tone due to endothelial dysfunction and enhances the pressor response to catecholamines and up-regulation of angiotensin {II} receptors. It induces electrolyte transport over the vascular smooth cell membrane and plays a crucial role in vascular remodeling of small and large arteries. Moreover, aldosterone is involved in vascular injury and promotes collagen synthesis, which leads to increased arterial stiffness and elevation of blood pressure. Aldosterone has also been shown to exert a number of effects in the central nervous system. Several human studies have shown that aldosterone is related to baroreflex resetting. Thus, in cases of severe hypertension, there would be fewer compensatory mechanisms to offset blood pressure elevation and ensuing vascular damage. Endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells have the potential to synthesize aldosterone, and tissue aldosterone could play a more important role in resistant hypertension and target organ damage than circulating aldosterone. Understanding aldosterone synthase polymorphism may provide insight into blood pressure patterns and their consequences. Understanding the vascular mechanisms of aldosterone in resistant hypertension may explain why selective aldosterone receptor blockers might have beneficial effects in resistant hypertension.},

The post-baseline, time-dependent {BPs} [systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) and diastolic blood pressure ({DBP})] were categorized into 10 {mmHg} increments. The primary outcome was a composite of death from coronary disease, non-fatal myocardial infarction ({MI}), resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal or non-fatal stroke. Among the 10 001 patients, 982 (9.82\%) experienced a primary outcome at 4.9 years (median) of follow-up. The relationship between {SBP} or {DBP} and primary outcome followed a J-curve with increased event rates above and below the reference {BP} range, both unadjusted and adjusted (for baseline covariates, treatment effect, and {LDL} levels). A time-dependent, non-linear, multivariate Cox proportional hazard model identified a nadir of 146.3/81.4 {mmHg} where the event rate was lowest. A similar non-linear relationship with a higher risk of events at lower pressures was found for most of the secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal {MI}, or angina.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Adherence to evidence-based cardiovascular ({CV}) medications after an acute myocardial infarction ({MI}) is low after the first 6 months. The use of fixed-dose combinations ({FDC}) has been shown to improve treatment adherence and risk factor control. However, no previous randomized trial has analyzed the impact of a polypill strategy on adherence in post-{MI} patients. {OBJECTIVES}: The cross-sectional {FOCUS} (Fixed-Dose Combination Drug for Secondary Cardiovascular Prevention) study (Phase 1) aimed to elucidate factors that interfere with appropriate adherence to {CV} medications for secondary prevention after an acute {MI}. Additionally, 695 patients from Phase 1 were randomized into a controlled trial (Phase 2) to test the effect of a polypill (containing aspirin 100 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, and ramipril 2.5, 5, or 10 mg) compared with the 3 drugs given separately on adherence, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as safety and tolerability over a period of 9 months of follow-up. {METHODS}: In Phase 1, a 5-country cohort of 2,118 patients was analyzed. Patients were randomized to either the polypill or 3 drugs separately for Phase 2. Primary endpoint was adherence to the treatment measured at the final visit by the self-reported Morisky-Green questionnaire ({MAQ}) and pill count (patients had to meet both criteria for adherence at the in-person visit to be considered adherent). {RESULTS}: In Phase 1, overall {CV} medication adherence, defined as an {MAQ} score of 20, was 45.5\%. In a multivariable regression model, the risk of being nonadherent ({MAQ} {\textless}20) was associated with younger age, depression, being on a complex medication regimen, poorer health insurance coverage, and a lower level of social support, with consistent findings across countries. In Phase 2, the polypill group showed improved adherence compared with the group receiving separate medications after 9 months of follow-up: 50.8\% versus 41\% (p = 0.019; intention-to-treat population) and 65.7\% versus 55.7\% (p = 0.012; per protocol population) when using the primary endpoint, attending the final visit with {MAQ} = 20 and high pill count (80\% to 110\%) combined, to assess adherence. Adherence also was higher in the {FDC} group when measured by {MAQ} alone (68\% vs. 59\%, p = 0.049). No treatment difference was found at follow-up in mean systolic blood pressure (129.6 mm Hg vs. 128.6 mm Hg), mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (89.9 mg/dl vs. 91.7 mg/dl), serious adverse events (23 vs. 21), or death (1, 0.3\% in each group). {CONCLUSIONS}: For secondary prevention following acute {MI}, younger age, depression, and a complex drug treatment plan are associated with lower medication adherence. Meanwhile, adherence is increased in patients with higher insurance coverage levels and social support. Compared with the 3 drugs given separately, the use of a polypill strategy met the primary endpoint for adherence for secondary prevention following an acute {MI}.

A rate-limiting step is the development of electronic phenotype selection algorithms to find such cohorts. This study evaluated the portability of a published phenotype algorithm to identify rheumatoid arthritis ({RA}) patients from {EHR} records at three institutions with different {EHR} systems. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Physicians reviewed charts from three institutions to identify patients with {RA}. Each institution compiled attributes from various sources in the {EHR}, including codified data and clinical narratives, which were searched using one of two natural language processing ({NLP}) systems. The performance of the published model was compared with locally retrained models. {RESULTS}: Applying the previously published model from Partners Healthcare to datasets from Northwestern and Vanderbilt Universities, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was found to be 92\% for Northwestern and 95\% for Vanderbilt, compared with 97\% at Partners. Retraining the model improved the average sensitivity at a specificity of 97\% to 72\% from the original 65\%. Both the original logistic regression models and locally retrained models were superior to simple billing code count thresholds. {DISCUSSION}: These results show that a previously published algorithm for {RA} is portable to two external hospitals using different {EHR} systems, different {NLP} systems, and different target {NLP} vocabularies. Retraining the algorithm primarily increased the sensitivity at each site. {CONCLUSION}: Electronic phenotype algorithms allow rapid identification of case populations in multiple sites with little retraining.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Hypertension is the leading risk factor contributing to the global burden of disease. We aimed to assess the change in blood pressure management between 1994 and 2011 in England with a series of annual surveys. {METHODS}: We did a serial cross-sectional study of five Health Survey for England surveys based on nationally representative samples of non-institutionalised adults (aged {\textgreater}/=16 years). Mean blood pressure levels and rates of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension were assessed. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or higher, diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or higher, or receiving treatment for high blood pressure. {FINDINGS}: The mean blood pressure levels of men and women in the general population and among patients with treated hypertension progressively improved between 1994 and 2011. In patients with treated hypertension, blood pressure improved from 150.0 ({SE} 0.59)/80.2 (0.27) mm Hg to 135.4 (0.58)/73.5 (0.41) mm Hg. Awareness, treatment, and control rates among men and women combined also improved significantly across each stage of this 17-year period, with the prevalence of control among treated patients almost doubling from 33\% ({SE} 1.4) in 1994 to 63\% (1.7) in 2011. Nevertheless, of all adults with survey-defined hypertension in 2011, hypertension was controlled in only 37\%. {INTERPRETATION}: If the same systematic improvement in all aspects of hypertension management continues until 2022, 80\% of patients with treated hypertension will have controlled blood pressure levels with a potential annual saving of about 50,000 major cardiovascular events. {FUNDING}: None.},

We assessed the risk of serious arrhythmia, defined as ventricular arrhythmia or sudden/unattended death identified in hospital discharge diagnoses, related to fluoroquinolones as a class as well as for each individual molecule. {METHODS}: We used a cohort of patients treated for respiratory conditions from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2005, identified using the healthcare databases from the province of Quebec (Canada), with follow-up until 31 March 2007. A nested case-control analysis was performed within this cohort, with all cases of serious arrhythmia occurring during follow-up identified from hospitalization records. These cases were matched with up to 20 controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute adjusted rate ratios ({RRs}) of serious arrhythmia associated with fluoroquinolone use. {RESULTS}: Within the cohort of 605127 subjects, 1838 cases were identified (incidence rate=4.7/10000 person-years). The rate of serious arrhythmia was elevated with current fluoroquinolone use ({RR}=1.76; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.19-2.59), in particular with new current use ({RR}=2.23; 95\% {CI}, 1.31-3.80). Gatifloxacin use was associated with the highest rate ({RR}=7.38; 95\% {CI}, 2.30-23.70); moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin were also associated with elevated rates of serious arrhythmia ({RR}=3.30; 95\% {CI}, 1.47-7.37 and {RR}=2.15; 95\% {CI}, 1.34-3.46, respectively). {CONCLUSIONS}: The use fluoroquinolones is associated with an elevated risk of serious arrhythmia, with some differences among molecules. Given that the individual fluoroquinolones share various indications, the relative risks of serious arrhythmia could inform the choice of different molecules in high-risk patients.},

Accordingly, we performed a retrospective study in 47 patients with a-{TRH} who had completed the eight-item {MMAS} during the initial clinic visit. Non-adherence was defined as presence of undetected serum levels of at least one prescribed antihypertensive drug by therapeutic drug monitoring. We found that 26\% of patients were considered to have low adherence score ({\textless}6), while the actual prevalence of non-adherence was 51\% by therapeutic drug monitoring. Sensitivity of the {MMAS}-8 was 26\% (95\% confidence interval, 10.3\%-48.4\%) with specificity of 75\% (95\% confidence interval, 53.3\%-90.2\%). By multivariate analysis, the {MMAS}-8 score was not an independent predictor of non-adherence, while certain clinical parameters such as heart rate were found to be independent predictors of non-adherence.

Whether these or other characteristics predict blood pressure responses when the drugs are administered as add-on therapy is uncertain. {METHODS}: We evaluated predictors of blood pressure response in 363 men and women {\textless} or =65 years of age with primary hypertension (152 blacks, 211 whites), 86 of whom (24\%) were untreated and 277 of whom (76\%) were withdrawn from previous antihypertensive drugs before randomization to either atenolol followed by addition of hydrochlorothiazide (N = 180) or hydrochlorothiazide followed by addition of atenolol (N = 183). Responses were determined by home blood pressure averages before and after each drug administration. Race, age, plasma renin activity, and other characteristics including pretreatment blood pressure levels were incorporated into linear regression models to quantify their contributions to prediction of blood pressure responses. {RESULTS}: Plasma renin activity and pretreatment blood pressure level consistently contributed to prediction of systolic and diastolic responses to each drug administered as mono- and as add-on therapy. Higher plasma renin activity was consistently associated with greater blood pressure responses to atenolol and lesser responses to hydrochlorothiazide. The predictive effects of plasma renin activity were statistically independent of race, age, and other characteristics. {CONCLUSIONS}: Plasma renin activity and pretreatment blood pressure level predict blood pressure responses to atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide administered as mono- and as add-on therapy in men and women {\textless} or =65 years of age.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Several large-scale trials have demonstrated improved survival with {ACE}-inhibitor therapy started during acute myocardial infarction. A systematic overview was conducted to resolve uncertainties regarding time of initiation, time course of effect, and identification of patients in whom the benefits or the risks may be greater. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: This overview aimed to include individual data from all randomized trials involving more than 1000 patients in which {ACE}-inhibitor treatment was started in the acute phase (0 to 36 hours) of myocardial infarction and continued for a short time (4 to 6 weeks). Data were available for 98,496 patients from 4 eligible trials, and the results were consistent among the trials. Thirty-day mortality was 7.1\% among patients allocated to {ACE} inhibitors and 7.6\% among control subjects, corresponding to a 7\% ({SD}, 2\%) proportional reduction (95\% {CI}, 2\% to 11\%; 2P{\textless}0.004). This represented avoidance of approximately 5 ({SD}, 2) deaths per 1000 patients, with most of the benefit observed within the first week. The proportional benefit was similar in patients at different underlying risk. The absolute benefit was particularly large in some high-risk groups (ie, Killip class 2 to 3, heart rate {\textgreater} or = 100 bpm at entry) and in anterior {MI}. {ACE}-inhibitor therapy also reduced the incidence of nonfatal cardiac failure (14.6\% versus 15.2\%, 2P=0.01) but was associated with an excess of persistent hypotension (17.6\% versus 9.3\%, 2P{\textless}0.01) and renal dysfunction (1.3\% versus 0.6\%, 2P{\textless}0.01). {CONCLUSIONS}: These results support the use of {ACE} inhibitors early in the treatment of acute {MI}, either to a wide range of patients or selectively in patients with anterior {MI} and in those at increased risk of death.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Public-use blood pressure ({BP}) kiosks are commonly used, and yet their accuracy has been questioned on the basis of the results of the published validation studies. However, the adherence of these studies to established validation standards has not been studied. We carried out a systematic review of the published peer-reviewed literature on the validity of public-use {BP} kiosks to assess their adherence to validation standards. {METHODS}: With medical librarian assistance, the literature was searched systematically for studies claiming to validate kiosks up to June 2012. Studies were limited to English articles that studied adult patients and were excluded if they were carried out solely on pregnant women. Two authors independently compared the study methods with those recommended in the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, British Hypertension Society and the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol validation standards. {RESULTS}: Nine studies were identified, of which only one came close to adhering to selected validation standard criteria, and found the device to be accurate. One study found device accuracy with poor adherence to standards, whereas the remaining seven found device inaccuracy with poor adherence to standards, therefore potentially reporting false conclusions. {CONCLUSION}: The majority of the reviewed studies validating public-use {BP} kiosks did not adhere to existing validation standards and therefore may have reported false conclusions. The one study that came close to following the validation standards found the device tested to be accurate. Readers must critically appraise the quality of validation studies published on these devices before interpreting their accuracy, and future studies should better adhere to existing validation standards to reduce the risk of reporting potentially false conclusions.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Blood pressure reduction achieved with beta-blockers and diuretics is the best recorded intervention to date for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and death in patients with hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy ({LVH}) is a strong independent indicator of risk of cardiovascular morbidity and death. We aimed to establish whether selective blocking of angiotensin {II} improves {LVH} beyond reducing blood pressure and, consequently, reduces cardiovascular morbidity and death. {METHODS}: We did a double-masked, randomised, parallel-group trial in 9193 participants aged 55-80 years with essential hypertension (sitting blood pressure 160-200/95-115 mm Hg) and {LVH} ascertained by electrocardiography ({ECG}). We assigned participants once daily losartan-based or atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment for at least 4 years and until 1040 patients had a primary cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke). We used Cox regression analysis to compare regimens. {FINDINGS}: Blood pressure fell by 30.2/16.6 ({SD} 18.5/10.1) and 29.1/16.8 mm Hg (19.2/10.1) in the losartan and atenolol groups, respectively. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 508 losartan (23.8 per 1000 patient-years) and 588 atenolol patients (27.9 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 0.87, 95\% {CI} 0.77-0.98, p=0.021). 204 losartan and 234 atenolol patients died from cardiovascular disease (0.89, 0.73-1.07, p=0.206); 232 and 309, respectively, had fatal or non-fatal stroke (0.75, 0.63-0.89, p=0.001); and myocardial infarction (non-fatal and fatal) occurred in 198 and 188, respectively (1.07, 0.88-1.31, p=0.491). New-onset diabetes was less frequent with losartan. Interpretation Losartan prevents more cardiovascular morbidity and death than atenolol for a similar reduction in blood pressure and is better tolerated. Losartan seems to confer benefits beyond reduction in blood pressure.},

Specificity of algorithms was significantly improved by 0.03 to 0.17 when both a medical claim with a diagnosis and a pharmacy claim for a medication commonly used to treat the condition were required. Sensitivity improved significantly by 0.01 to 0.20 when the algorithm relied on a medical claim with a diagnosis or a pharmacy claim, and by 0.05 to 0.17 when two years rather than one year of claims data were analyzed. Algorithms that had specificity more than 0.95 were found for all six conditions. Sensitivity above 0.90 was not achieved all conditions. {CONCLUSIONS}: Varying claims criteria improved the performance of case-finding algorithms for six chronic conditions. Highly specific, and sometimes sensitive, algorithms for identifying members of health plans with several chronic conditions can be developed using claims data.},

	abstract = {We examined long-term influence of the angiotensin {II} type 1-receptor blocker irbesartan and the beta1-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol on some neurohormonal systems implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, 115 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy were randomized to receive double-blind irbesartan or atenolol, with additional therapy if needed. Neurohormone measurements and echocardiography were performed at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 48. Left ventricular mass was reduced more by irbesartan than by atenolol (-26 g/m2 versus -14 g/m2, P = 0.024), despite similar reductions in blood pressure. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin {II} increased (P {\textless} 0.001) by irbesartan (0.9 +/- 0.7 to 3.4 +/- 4.2 ng/{mL} x h, and 3.0 +/- 1.6 to 13.0 +/- 17.7 pmol/L), but decreased (P {\textless} 0.01) by atenolol (1.0 +/- 0.6 to 0.7 +/- 0.6 ng/{mL} x h, and 3.4 +/- 1.6 to 3.2 +/- 2.2 pmol/L). Serum aldosterone decreased (P {\textless} 0.05) by both irbesartan (346 +/- 140 to 325 +/- 87 pmol/L) and atenolol (315 +/- 115 to 283 +/- 77 pmol/L). Changes in left ventricular mass by irbesartan related inversely to changes in plasma renin activity, angiotensin {II}, and aldosterone (all P {\textless} 0.05). Plasma levels and 24-hour urinary excretions of catecholamines, plasma leptin, proinsulin, insulin and insulin sensitivity remained largely unchanged in both groups. Thus, the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system appears to be an important non-hemodynamic factor in the regulation of left ventricular mass.},

	abstract = {Previous reviews of the literature on medication compliance have confirmed the inverse relationship between number of daily doses and rate of compliance. However, compliance in most of these studies was based on patient self-report, blood-level monitoring, prescription refills, or pill count data, none of which are as accurate as electronic monitoring ({EM}).{\textbar}In this paper, we review studies in which compliance was measured with an {EM} device to determine the associations between dose frequency and medication compliance.{\textbar}Articles included in this review were identified through literature searches of {MEDLINE}, {PsychInfo}, {HealthStar}, Health \& Psychosocial Instruments, and the Cochrane Library using the search terms patient compliance, patient adherence, electronic monitoring, and {MEMS} (medication event monitoring systems). The review was limited to studies reporting compliance measured by {EM} devices, the most accurate compliance assessment method to date. Because {EM} was introduced only in 1986, the literature search was restricted to the years 1986 to 2000. In the identified studies, data were pooled to calculate mean compliance with once-daily, twice-daily, 3-times-daily, and 4-times-daily dosing regimens. Because of heterogeneity in definitions of compliance, 2 major categories of compliance rates were defined: dose-taking (taking the prescribed number of pills each day) and dose-timing (taking pills within the prescribed time frame).{\textbar}A total of 76 studies were identified. Mean dose-taking compliance was 71\% +/- 17\% (range, 34\%-97\%) and declined as the number of daily doses increased: 1 dose = 79\% +/- 14\%, 2 doses = 69\% +/- 15\%, 3 doses = 65\% +/- 16\%, 4 doses = 51\% +/- 20\% (P {\textless} 0.001 among dose schedules). Compliance was significantly higher for once-daily versus 3-times-daily (P = 0.008), once-daily versus 4-times-daily (P {\textless} 0.001), and twice-daily versus 4-times-daily regimens (P = 0.001); however, there were no significant differences in compliance between once-daily and twice-daily regimens or between twice-daily and 3-times-daily regimens. In the subset of 14 studies that reported dose-timing results, mean dose-timing compliance was 59\% +/- 24\%; more frequent dosing was associated with lower compliance rates.{\textbar}A review of studies that measured compliance using {EM} confirmed that the prescribed number of doses per day is inversely related to compliance.

For 2014, 3 existing recommendations were modified and 2 new recommendations were added. The following recommendations were modified: (1) the recommended sodium intake threshold was changed from {\textless}/= 1500 mg (3.75 g of salt) to approximately 2000 mg (5 g of salt) per day; (2) a pharmacotherapy treatment initiation systolic blood pressure threshold of {\textgreater}/= 160 mm Hg was added in very elderly (age {\textgreater}/= 80 years) patients who do not have diabetes or target organ damage (systolic blood pressure target in this population remains at {\textless} 150 mm Hg); and (3) the target population recommended to receive low-dose acetylsalicylic acid therapy for primary prevention was narrowed from all patients with controlled hypertension to only those {\textgreater}/= 50 years of age. The 2 new recommendations are: (1) advice to be cautious when lowering systolic blood pressure to target levels in patients with established coronary artery disease if diastolic blood pressure is {\textless}/= 60 mm Hg because of concerns that myocardial ischemia might be exacerbated; and (2) the addition of glycated hemoglobin (A1c) in the diagnostic work-up of patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. The rationale for these recommendation changes is discussed. In addition, emerging data on blood pressure targets in stroke patients are discussed; these data did not lead to recommendation changes at this time.

Participants, recruited by population-based screening of 158,906 people aged 30 to 69 years in 14 communities througout the United States, were randomly assigned to {SC} or {RC} groups within each center and by entry diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}) (90 to 104, 105 to 114, and 115 + mm Hg). Over the five years of the study, more than two thirds of the {SC} participants continued to receive medication, and more than 50\% achieved {BP} levels within the normotensive range, at or below the {HDFP} goal for {DBP}. Controls of {BP} was consistently better for the {SC} than for the {RC} group. Five-year mortality from all causes was 17\% lower for the {SC} group compared to the {RC} group (6.4 vs 7.7 per 100, P less than .01) and 20\% lower for the {SC} subgroup with entry {DBP} of 90 to 104 mm Hg compared to the corresponding {RC} subgroup (5.9 vs 7.4 per 100, P less than .01). These findings of the {HDFP} indicate that the systematic effective management of hypertension has a great potential for reducing mortality for the large numbers of people with high {BP} in the population, including those with "mild" hypertension.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Current definitions of hypertension are based on levels of systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) and diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}), but not on pulse pressure ({PP}). We examined whether {PP} adds useful information for predicting coronary heart disease ({CHD}) in the population-based Framingham Heart Study. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We studied 1924 men and women between 50 and 79 years of age at baseline with no clinical evidence of {CHD} and not taking antihypertensive drug therapy. Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, and other risk factors, was used to assess the relations between blood pressure components and {CHD} risk over a 20-year follow-up. The association with {CHD} risk was positive for {SBP}, {DBP}, and {PP}, considering each pressure individually; of the 3, {PP} yielded the largest chi(2) statistic. When {SBP} and {DBP} were jointly entered into the multivariable model, the association with {CHD} risk was positive for {SBP} ({HR}, 1.22; 95\% {CI}, 1.15 to 1.30) and negative for {DBP} ({HR}, 0. 86; 95\% {CI}, 0.75 to 0.98). Four subgroups were defined according to {SBP} levels ({\textless}120, 120 to 139, 140 to 159, and {\textgreater}/=160 mm Hg). Within each subgroup, the association with {CHD} risk was negative for {DBP} and positive for {PP}. A cross-classification of {SBP}-{DBP} levels confirmed these results. {CONCLUSIONS}: In the middle-aged and elderly, {CHD} risk increased with lower {DBP} at any level of {SBP}{\textgreater}/=120 mm Hg, suggesting that higher {PP} was an important component of risk. Neither {SBP} nor {DBP} was superior to {PP} in predicting {CHD} risk.},

No single tool for quantifying the complexity of general medication regimens has been published in the medical literature. {OBJECTIVE}: To develop and validate a tool to quantify the complexity of prescribed medication regimens. {METHODS}: Literature findings and the expertise of the authors were used for developing the tool. Eight pharmacy researchers helped in establishing the tool's face and content validity. The new tool was tested on 134 medication regimens from patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Six regimens with a spread of scores on the tool were presented to a 5-member expert panel that subjectively ranked these regimens to confirm the tool's criterion-related validity. The relationships between scores on the tool and various independent variables were tested to judge the tool's construct validity. Two raters scored 25 regimens using the tool to test its inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities. {RESULTS}: A 65-item Medication Regimen Complexity Index ({MRCI}) was developed. The expert panel had strong agreement (Kendall's W = 0.8; p = 0.001) on their individual rankings of the 6 regimens. The panel's consensus ranking had perfect correlation with the {MRCI} ranking. The total {MRCI} score had significant correlation with the number of drugs in the regimen (Spearman's Rho = 0.9; p {\textless} 0.0001), but not with the age and gender of the patients. Inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities for the total score and scores for individual sections on the {MRCI} were {\textgreater} or = 0.9. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {MRCI} is a reliable and valid tool for quantifying drug regimen complexity with potential applications in both practice and research.},

	abstract = {Controversy remains as to which patients with small bowel obstruction ({SBO}) need immediate surgery and which may be managed conservatively. This study evaluated the ability of clinical risk factors to predict the failure of nonoperative management of {SBO}. The electronic medical record was used to identify all patients with {SBO} over one year. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging data were recorded. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to identify risk factors predicting need for surgery. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify risk factors that influence need and timing for surgery. Two hundred nineteen consecutive patients were included. Most patients did not have a prior history of {SBO} (75\%), radiation therapy (92\%), or cancer (70\%). The majority had undergone previous abdominal or pelvic surgery (82\%). Thirty-five per cent of patients ultimately underwent laparotomy. Univariate analysis showed that persistent abdominal pain, abdominal distention, nausea and vomiting, guarding, obstipation, elevated white blood cell count, fever present 48 hours after hospitalization, and high-grade obstruction on computed tomography ({CT}) scan were significant predictors of the need for surgery. Multivariable analysis revealed that persistent abdominal pain or distention (hazard ratio [{HR}], 3.04; P = 0.013), both persistent abdominal pain and distention ({HR}, 4.96; P {\textless} 0.001), fever at 48 hours ({HR}, 3.66; P = 0.038), and {CT}-determined high-grade obstruction ({HR}, 3.45; P = 0.017) independently predicted the need for surgery. Eighty-five per cent of patients with none of these four significant risk factors were successfully managed nonoperatively. Conversely, 92 per cent of patients with three or more risk factors required laparotomy. This analysis revealed four readily evaluable clinical parameters that may be used to predict the need for surgery in patients presenting with {SBO}: persistent abdominal pain, abdominal distention, fever at 48 hours, and {CT} findings of high-grade obstruction. These factors were combined into a predictive model that may of use in predicting failure of nonoperative {SBO} management. Early operation in these patients should decrease length of stay and diagnostic costs.},

Rate ratios ({RRs}) for current users of {FQs} were computed using conditional logistic regression, which was adjusted for chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, hypothyroidism, postherpetic neuralgia, and the use of nitrofurantoin and metronidazole. {RESULTS}: We identified 6,226 cases and 24,904 controls.

	abstract = {Regular physical exercise is broadly recommended by current European and American hypertension guidelines. It remains elusive, however, whether exercise leads to a reduction of blood pressure in resistant hypertension as well. The present randomized controlled trial examines the cardiovascular effects of aerobic exercise on resistant hypertension. Resistant hypertension was defined as a blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg in spite of 3 antihypertensive agents or a blood pressure controlled by ≥4 antihypertensive agents. Fifty subjects with resistant hypertension were randomly assigned to participate or not to participate in an 8- to 12-week treadmill exercise program (target lactate, 2.0±0.5 mmol/L). Blood pressure was assessed by 24-hour monitoring. Arterial compliance and cardiac index were measured by pulse wave analysis. The training program was well tolerated by all of the patients. Exercise significantly decreased systolic and diastolic daytime ambulatory blood pressure by 6±12 and 3±7 mm Hg, respectively (P=0.03 each). Regular exercise reduced blood pressure on exertion and increased physical performance as assessed by maximal oxygen uptake and lactate curves. Arterial compliance and cardiac index remained unchanged. Physical exercise is able to decrease blood pressure even in subjects with low responsiveness to medical treatment. It should be included in the therapeutic approach to resistant hypertension.},

	abstract = {{STUDY} {OBJECTIVE}: Patients with coronary heart disease ({CHD}) frequently use the combination of a statin and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ({RAAS}) blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ({ACEI}) or angiotensin {II} receptor blocker ({ARB}), to control lipid levels and blood pressure, respectively, and the use of {ARBs} is increasing in Korean patients. Few studies are available, however, that have compared combination therapy with statin-{ACEIs} versus statin-{ARBs}. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether {ARBs} are associated with a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events ({MACCEs}) compared with {ACEIs} when used in combination with statins in patients with established {CHD}. {DESIGN}: Population-based retrospective cohort study. {DATA} {SOURCE}: Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database. {PATIENTS}: A total of 6577 adults who started statin-{RAAS} blocker combination therapy (1870 in the statin-{ACEI} cohort and 4707 in the statin-{ARB} cohort) after being diagnosed with {CHD} between January 2003 and December 2013 were included. Of these, 3676 propensity score-matched patients (1838 in the statin-{ACEI} cohort and 1838 in the statin-{ARB} cohort) were included in the final analyses. {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: The primary outcome was {MACCE} (major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events), a composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction ({MI}), ischemic stroke, and revascularization. Incidences and incidence rates of {MACCE} were calculated to estimate the differences between the two cohorts. Hazard ratios ({HRs}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}) were estimated by using a Cox proportional hazard model. The incidence of {MACCE} was 19.9\% and 14.7\%, and incidence rates were 11.7 and 8.1 per 100 person-years in the statin-{ACEI} and statin-{ARB} cohorts, respectively. The risk of {MACCE} was significantly lower in the statin-{ARB} cohort (adjusted {HR} 0.69, 95\% {CI} 0.59-0.81). {CONCLUSION}: A {MACCE} was less likely to occur in patients who received a statin-{ARB} than in those who received a statin-{ACEI}. Similar trends were seen in cardiovascular mortality and the occurrence of recurrent {MI} but not stroke. The availability of statin-{ARB} fixed-dose combinations may have contributed to the improved outcomes in the statin-{ARB} cohort by reducing pill burden and improving medication adherence. Further research is warranted to validate our findings and to address whether a particular statin-{ARB} combination is more effective than other combinations.},

	abstract = {Sepsis is one of the leading causes of mortality in hospitalized patients. Despite this fact, a reliable means of predicting sepsis onset remains elusive. Early and accurate sepsis onset predictions could allow more aggressive and targeted therapy while maintaining antimicrobial stewardship. Existing detection methods suffer from low performance and often require time-consuming laboratory test results. To study and validate a sepsis prediction method, {InSight}, for the new Sepsis-3 definitions in retrospective data, make predictions using a minimal set of variables from within the electronic health record data, compare the performance of this approach with existing scoring systems, and investigate the effects of data sparsity on {InSight} performance. We apply {InSight}, a machine learning classification system that uses multivariable combinations of easily obtained patient data (vitals, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, Glasgow Coma Score, and age), to predict sepsis using the retrospective Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care ({MIMIC})-{III} dataset, restricted to intensive care unit ({ICU}) patients aged 15 years or more. Following the Sepsis-3 definitions of the sepsis syndrome, we compare the classification performance of {InSight} versus quick sequential organ failure assessment ({qSOFA}), modified early warning score ({MEWS}), systemic inflammatory response syndrome ({SIRS}), simplified acute physiology score ({SAPS}) {II}, and sequential organ failure assessment ({SOFA}) to determine whether or not patients will become septic at a fixed period of time before onset. We also test the robustness of the {InSight} system to random deletion of individual input observations. In a test dataset with 11.3\% sepsis prevalence, {InSight} produced superior classification performance compared with the alternative scores as measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ({AUROC}) and area under precision-recall curves ({APR}). In detection of sepsis onset, {InSight} attains {AUROC} = 0.880 ({SD} 0.006) at onset time and {APR} = 0.595 ({SD} 0.016), both of which are superior to the performance attained by {SIRS} ({AUROC}: 0.609; {APR}: 0.160), {qSOFA} ({AUROC}: 0.772; {APR}: 0.277), and {MEWS} ({AUROC}: 0.803; {APR}: 0.327) computed concurrently, as well as {SAPS} {II} ({AUROC}: 0.700; {APR}: 0.225) and {SOFA} ({AUROC}: 0.725; {APR}: 0.284) computed at admission (P{\textless}.001 for all comparisons). Similar results are observed for 1-4 hours preceding sepsis onset. In experiments where approximately 60\% of input data are deleted at random, {InSight} attains an {AUROC} of 0.781 ({SD} 0.013) and {APR} of 0.401 ({SD} 0.015) at sepsis onset time. Even with 60\% of data missing, {InSight} remains superior to the corresponding {SIRS} scores ({AUROC} and {APR}, P{\textless}.001), {qSOFA} scores (P=.0095; P{\textless}.001) and superior to {SOFA} and {SAPS} {II} computed at admission ({AUROC} and {APR}, P{\textless}.001), where all of these comparison scores (except {InSight}) are computed without data deletion. Despite using little more than vitals, {InSight} is an effective tool for predicting sepsis onset and performs well even with randomly missing data.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To propose a unifying set of definitions for prescription adherence research utilizing electronic health record prescribing databases, prescription dispensing databases, and pharmacy claims databases and to provide a conceptual framework to operationalize these definitions consistently across studies. {METHODS}: We reviewed recent literature to identify definitions in electronic database studies of prescription-filling patterns for chronic oral medications. We then develop a conceptual model and propose standardized terminology and definitions to describe prescription-filling behavior from electronic databases. {RESULTS}: The conceptual model we propose defines 2 separate constructs: medication adherence and persistence. We define primary and secondary adherence as distinct subtypes of adherence. Metrics for estimating secondary adherence are discussed and critiqued, including a newer metric (New Prescription Medication Gap measure) that enables estimation of both primary and secondary adherence. {DISCUSSION}: Terminology currently used in prescription adherence research employing electronic databases lacks consistency. We propose a clear, consistent, broadly applicable conceptual model and terminology for such studies. The model and definitions facilitate research utilizing electronic medication prescribing, dispensing, and/or claims databases and encompasses the entire continuum of prescription-filling behavior. {CONCLUSION}: Employing conceptually clear and consistent terminology to define medication adherence and persistence will facilitate future comparative effectiveness research and meta-analytic studies that utilize electronic prescription and dispensing records.},

A total of 1957 patients with {UA}/{NSTEMI} were assigned to receive unfractionated heparin (test cohort) and 1953 to receive enoxaparin in {TIMI} 11B; 1564 and 1607 were assigned respectively in {ESSENCE}. The 3 validation cohorts were the unfractionated heparin group from {ESSENCE} and both enoxaparin groups. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The {TIMI} risk score was derived in the test cohort by selection of independent prognostic variables using multivariate logistic regression, assignment of value of 1 when a factor was present and 0 when it was absent, and summing the number of factors present to categorize patients into risk strata. Relative differences in response to therapeutic interventions were determined by comparing the slopes of the rates of events with increasing score in treatment groups and by testing for an interaction between risk score and treatment. Outcomes were {TIMI} risk score for developing at least 1 component of the primary end point (all-cause mortality, new or recurrent {MI}, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization) through 14 days after randomization. {RESULTS}: The 7 {TIMI} risk score predictor variables were age 65 years or older, at least 3 risk factors for coronary artery disease, prior coronary stenosis of 50\% or more, {ST}-segment deviation on electrocardiogram at presentation, at least 2 anginal events in prior 24 hours, use of aspirin in prior 7 days, and elevated serum cardiac markers. Event rates increased significantly as the {TIMI} risk score increased in the test cohort in {TIMI} 11B: 4.7\% for a score of 0/1; 8.3\% for 2; 13. 2\% for 3; 19.9\% for 4; 26.2\% for 5; and 40.9\% for 6/7 (P{\textless}.001 by chi(2) for trend). The pattern of increasing event rates with increasing {TIMI} risk score was confirmed in all 3 validation groups (P{\textless}.001). The slope of the increase in event rates with increasing numbers of risk factors was significantly lower in the enoxaparin groups in both {TIMI} 11B (P =.01) and {ESSENCE} (P =.03) and there was a significant interaction between {TIMI} risk score and treatment (P =. 02). {CONCLUSIONS}: In patients with {UA}/{NSTEMI}, the {TIMI} risk score is a simple prognostication scheme that categorizes a patient's risk of death and ischemic events and provides a basis for therapeutic decision making. {JAMA}. 2000;284:835-842},

The primary outcomes were progression to {ESRD} and death as ascertained by linkage with United States Renal Data System and Social Security Administration Death Master files, respectively, through September 29, 2011. We evaluated the performance of 3 models which included demographic, comorbidity and laboratory data to predict progression of {CKD} to {ESRD} in conditions commonly targeted for disease management (hypertension, diabetes, chronic viral diseases and severe {CKD}) using traditional discriminatory criteria ({AUC}) and recent criteria intended to guide population health management strategies. {RESULTS}: Overall, 1730 persons progressed to end-stage renal disease and 7628 died during median follow-up of 6.6 years. Performance of risk models incorporating common {EHR} variables was highest in hypertension, intermediate in diabetes and chronic viral diseases, and lowest in severe {CKD}. Surveillance of persons who were in the highest quintile of {ESRD} risk yielded 83-94 \%, 74-95 \%, and 75-82 \% of cases who progressed to {ESRD} among patients with hypertension, diabetes and chronic viral diseases, respectively.

Despite the importance of this health problem, there is a lack of definitive data on the effects of the intensive control of glycemia and other {CVD} risk factors on {CVD} event rates in patients with type 2 diabetes. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ({ACCORD}) trial is a randomized, multicenter, double 2 x 2 factorial design study involving 10,251 middle-aged and older participants with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for {CVD} events because of existing {CVD} or additional risk factors. {ACCORD} is testing the effects of 3 medical treatment strategies to reduce {CVD} morbidity and mortality. All participants are in the glycemia trial, which is testing the hypothesis that a therapeutic strategy that targets a glycosylated hemoglobin ({HbA}1c) level of {\textless}6.0\% will reduce the rate of {CVD} events more than a strategy that targets an {HbA}1c level of 7.0\%-7.9\%. The lipid trial includes 5,518 of the participants, who receive either fenofibrate or placebo in a double-masked fashion to test the hypothesis of whether, in the context of good glycemic control, a therapeutic strategy that uses a fibrate to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels together with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol will reduce the rate of {CVD} events compared with a strategy that uses a statin plus a placebo. The blood pressure trial includes the remaining 4,733 participants and tests the hypothesis that a therapeutic strategy that targets a systolic blood pressure of {\textless}120 mm Hg in the context of good glycemic control will reduce the rate of {CVD} events compared with a strategy that targets a systolic blood pressure of {\textless}140 mm Hg. The primary outcome measure for all 3 research questions is the first occurrence of a major {CVD} event, specifically nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Upon the expected completion of participant follow-up in 2009, the {ACCORD} trial should document for the first time the benefits and risks of intensive glucose control, intensive blood pressure control, and the combination of fibrate and statin drugs in managing blood lipids in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction after myocardial infarction are major predictors of death. In experimental and clinical studies, longterm therapy with the angiotensin-converting--enzyme inhibitor captopril attenuated ventricular dilatation and remodeling. We investigated whether captopril could reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after a myocardial infarction. {METHODS}: Within 3 to 16 days after myocardial infarction, 2231 patients with ejection fractions of 40 percent or less but without overt heart failure or symptoms of myocardial ischemia were randomly assigned to receive doubleblind treatment with either placebo (1116 patients) or captopril (1115 patients) and were followed for an average of 42 months. {RESULTS}: Mortality from all causes was significantly reduced in the captopril group (228 deaths, or 20 percent) as compared with the placebo group (275 deaths, or 25 percent); the reduction in risk was 19 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 32 percent; P = 0.019). In addition, the incidence of both fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events was consistently reduced in the captopril group. The reduction in risk was 21 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 35 percent; P = 0.014) for death from cardiovascular causes, 37 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 20 to 50 percent; P less than 0.001) for the development of severe heart failure, 22 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 37 percent; P = 0.019) for congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization, and 25 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 40 percent; P = 0.015) for recurrent myocardial infarction. {CONCLUSIONS}: In patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, long-term administration of captopril was associated with an improvement in survival and reduced morbidity and mortality due to major cardiovascular events. These benefits were observed in patients who received thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, or beta-blockers, as well as those who did not, suggesting that treatment with captopril leads to additional improvement in outcome among selected survivors of myocardial infarction.},

The aim of the study was to compare costs, clinical outcome, and quality-adjusted survival between primary {PCI} and thrombolysis.{\textbar}Patients with {ST}-elevation myocardial infarction were randomized to primary {PCI} with adjunctive enoxaparin and abciximab (n = 101), or to enoxaparin followed by reteplase (n = 104). Data on the use of health care resources, work loss, and health-related quality of life were collected during a 1-year period. Cost-effectiveness was determined by comparing costs and quality-adjusted survival. The joint distribution of incremental costs and quality-adjusted survival was analyzed using a nonparametric bootstrap approach.{\textbar}Clinical outcome did not differ significantly between the groups. Compared with the group treated with thrombolysis, the cost of interventions was higher in the {PCI}-treated group (\$4,602 vs \$3,807; P = .047), as well as the cost of drugs (\$1,309 vs \$1,202; P = .001), whereas the cost of hospitalization was lower (\$7,344 vs \$9,278; P = .025). The cost of investigations, outpatient care, and loss of production did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment arms. Total cost and quality-adjusted survival were \$25,315 and 0.759 vs \$27,819 and 0.728 (both not significant) for the primary {PCI} and thrombolysis groups, respectively. Based on the 1-year follow-up, bootstrap analysis revealed that in 80\%, 88\%, and 89\% of the replications, the cost per health outcome gained for {PCI} will be {\textless}\$0, \$50,000, and \$100,000 respectively.{\textbar}In a 1-year perspective, there was a tendency toward lower costs and better health outcome after primary {PCI}, resulting in costs for {PCI} in comparison to thrombolysis that will be below the conventional threshold for cost-effectiveness in 88\% of bootstrap replications.},

However, limited information is available concerning variables associated with stroke case fatality at these different points in time. We sought to identify and compare variables associated with 7-day, 30-day, and 1-year stroke fatality.{\textbar}This was a cohort study of consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to 11 stroke centers in Ontario, Canada, between July 2003 and March 2005 and captured in the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network ({RCSN}). The {RCSN} database was linked to administrative databases to capture all deaths occurring within 7, 30, and 365 days of hospital admission for ischemic stroke. Logistic regression was used to determine variables associated with stroke fatality at each time point. Outcome measures were all-location mortality within 7 days, 30 days, and 1 year of hospital admission.{\textbar}Our cohort included 3631 patients admitted with ischemic stroke. Seven-day case fatality was 6.9\% (249/3631), 30-day case fatality was 12.6\% (457/3631), and 1-year case fatality was 23.6\% (856/3631). In the multivariable analyses, stroke severity, neurologic deterioration during hospitalization, nonuse of antithrombotics during hospital admission, and lack of assessment by a stroke team were the most consistent predictors of case fatality at 7 days, 30 days, and 1 year after stroke. Physician experience in stroke management was inversely associated with 7-day and 30-day mortality, whereas age, comorbid illness, and pneumonia during hospital admission were associated with 30-day and 1-year mortality.{\textbar}Stroke severity and certain processes of care were associated with case fatality at 7 days, 30 days, and 1 year after stroke.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Several reports have questioned the lack of safety data on calcium antagonists as a drug class. Because this drug class is heterogeneous, unique features of certain calcium antagonists may set them apart in terms of safety and efficacy. {HYPOTHESIS}: With in excess of 7,000 person-years of observation from randomized clinical trials, verapamil was selected to evaluate whether there was evidence of harm in patients with cardiovascular disease. {METHODS}: {MEDLINE} search of English-language articles, Science Citation Index, Current Contents, manual review of cited references, pharmaceutical files, and investigator correspondence was performed. Independent review of 66 articles identified 14 randomized, parallel-group studies for inclusion. Independent, duplicate assessments were made of patient outcomes and trial characteristics (including study design, treatment dosage and schedule, duration of treatment, inclusion criteria, and sample size). Standard meta-analytic techniques were employed for analysis and interpretation of results. {RESULTS}: Based on over 4,000 person-years of observation, patients with acute myocardial infarction ({MI}) treated with verapamil had a decreased risk of nonfatal reinfarction compared with placebo (relative risk 0.79; 2-sided 95\% confidence interval 0.65.0.97; p = 0.024). Verapamil had no significant effect on overall mortality compared with placebo (relative risk ranged from 0.93; 2-sided 95\% confidence interval 0.78, 1.10; p = 0.40 to 0.86; 2-sided 95\% confidence interval 0.71, 1.04; p = 0.13) depending on rules used to include or exclude patients from the pooling process. For the combined outcome of death or reinfarction, verapamil use was associated with a decreased risk compared with placebo (relative risk 0.82; 2-sided 95\% confidence interval 0.70, 0.97; p = 0.016). In patients with angina involving a wide spectrum of disease severity, data were limited to 2,900 person-years of observation, and verapamil use did not appear to be associated with an apparent effect on mortality or {MI}. Data available from randomized studies of verapamil in patients with hypertension were too limited to reach conclusions (50 person-years of observation, with no deaths or {MIs} reported). Subgroups of hypertensive patients in two of the largest post-{MI} studies and the largest angina study, involving over 600 patients, yielded little useful added information. {CONCLUSIONS}: In patients with {MI}, the risks of both nonfatal reinfarction and the combined outcome of death or nonfatal {MI} were reduced over intermediate-term follow-up among patients treated with verapamil compared with controls (p = 0.024 and p = 0.016, respectively). In patients with angina, no evidence for harm was noted, but in hypertension the data were too limited to draw conclusions. These findings support the need to distinguish among different calcium antagonist compounds and to emphasize the need for more data in patients with hypertension.},

The {HMI} was in effect in 11 primary care sites across the province of Ontario, Canada. This was a qualitative study. Focus groups and a lobby survey were completed with a total of 199 of the 3934 patients enrolled in the study. Interviews with 41 participating health care providers from all sites were performed. A qualitative description approach was used to give a rich description of each informant's experiences. Patients expressed motivation and engagement in their own health care and became more knowledgeable about hypertension and how to manage it with their health care providers. Most reported satisfaction with the discipline of regular appointments and ongoing monitoring and counseling of the program including identifying and working on goals for their modifiable risk factors. Their health care providers felt the {HMI} program had a positive impact on the treatment and management of hypertension and also that it improved the functioning of the interprofessional team. The {HMI} helped to improve patient self-empowerment and self-management and also improved physicians' and nurses' confidence in diagnosing accurately and in hypertension management. Physician buy-in is key to maintaining clinical hypertension management. Interprofessional collaboration was improved for physicians and nurses but less so for pharmacists. Greater confidence among the nurses to manage hypertension more independently reduced demands on physician time.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The purpose of this article was to determine whether longitudinal historical data, commonly available in electronic health record ({EHR}) systems, can be used to predict patients' future risk of suicidal behavior. {METHOD}: Bayesian models were developed using a retrospective cohort approach. {EHR} data from a large health care database spanning 15 years (1998-2012) of inpatient and outpatient visits were used to predict future documented suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide attempt or death). Patients with three or more visits (N=1,728,549) were included. {ICD}-9-based case definition for suicidal behavior was derived by expert clinician consensus review of 2,700 narrative {EHR} notes (from 520 patients), supplemented by state death certificates. Model performance was evaluated retrospectively using an independent testing set. {RESULTS}: Among the study population, 1.2\% (N=20,246) met the case definition for suicidal behavior. The model achieved sensitive (33\%-45\% sensitivity), specific (90\%-95\% specificity), and early (3-4 years in advance on average) prediction of patients' future suicidal behavior. The strongest predictors identified by the model included both well-known (e.g., substance abuse and psychiatric disorders) and less conventional (e.g., certain injuries and chronic conditions) risk factors, indicating that a data-driven approach can yield more comprehensive risk profiles. {CONCLUSIONS}: Longitudinal {EHR} data, commonly available in clinical settings, can be useful for predicting future risk of suicidal behavior. This modeling approach could serve as an early warning system to help clinicians identify high-risk patients for further screening. By analyzing the full phenotypic breadth of the {EHR}, computerized risk screening approaches may enhance prediction beyond what is feasible for individual clinicians.},

	abstract = {Over the past years, research utilizing routine care data extracted from Electronic Medical Records ({EMRs}) has increased tremendously. Yet there are no straightforward, standardized strategies for pre-processing these data. We propose a dedicated medical pre-processing pipeline aimed at taking on many problems and opportunities contained within {EMR} data, such as their temporal, inaccurate and incomplete nature. The pipeline is demonstrated on a dataset of routinely recorded data in general practice {EMRs} of over 260,000 patients, in which the occurrence of colorectal cancer ({CRC}) is predicted using various machine learning techniques (i.e., {CART}, {LR}, {RF}) and subsets of the data. {CRC} is a common type of cancer, of which early detection has proven to be important yet challenging. The results are threefold. First, the predictive models generated using our pipeline reconfirmed known predictors and identified new, medically plausible, predictors derived from the cardiovascular and metabolic disease domain, validating the pipeline's effectiveness. Second, the difference between the best model generated by the data-driven subset ({AUC} 0.891) and the best model generated by the current state of the art hypothesis-driven subset ({AUC} 0.864) is statistically significant at the 95\% confidence interval level. Third, the pipeline itself is highly generic and independent of the specific disease targeted and the {EMR} used. In conclusion, the application of established machine learning techniques in combination with the proposed pipeline on {EMRs} has great potential to enhance disease prediction, and hence early detection and intervention in medical practice.},

Causal attribution of morbidity and mortality to risk factors has traditionally been in the context of individual risk factors, often in a limited number of settings, restricting comparability. Our aim was to estimate the contributions of selected major risk factors to global and regional burden of disease in a unified framework.{\textbar}For 26 selected risk factors, expert working groups undertook a comprehensive review of published work and other sources--eg, government reports and international databases--to obtain data on the prevalence of risk factor exposure and hazard size for 14 epidemiological regions of the world. Population attributable fractions were estimated by applying the potential impact fraction relation, and applied to the mortality and burden of disease estimates from the global burden of disease ({GBD}) database.{\textbar}Childhood and maternal underweight (138 million disability adjusted life years [{DALY}], 9.5\%), unsafe sex (92 million {DALY}, 6.3\%), high blood pressure (64 million {DALY}, 4.4\%), tobacco (59 million {DALY}, 4.1\%), and alcohol (58 million {DALY}, 4.0\%) were the leading causes of global burden of disease. In the poorest regions of the world, childhood and maternal underweight, unsafe sex, unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene, indoor smoke from solid fuels, and various micronutrient deficiencies were major contributors to loss of healthy life. In both developing and developed regions, alcohol, tobacco, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol were major causes of disease burden.{\textbar}Substantial proportions of global disease burden are attributable to these major risks, to an extent greater than previously estimated. Developing countries suffer most or all of the burden due to many of the leading risks. Strategies that target these known risks can provide substantial and underestimated public-health gains.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Clinical deterioration ({ICU} transfer and cardiac arrest) occurs during approximately 5-10\% of hospital admissions. Existing prediction models have a high false positive rate, leading to multiple false alarms and alarm fatigue. We used routine vital signs and laboratory values obtained from the electronic medical record ({EMR}) along with a machine learning algorithm called a neural network to develop a prediction model that would increase the predictive accuracy and decrease false alarm rates. {DESIGN}: Retrospective cohort study. {SETTING}: The hematologic malignancy unit in an academic medical center in the United States. {PATIENT} {POPULATION}: Adult patients admitted to the hematologic malignancy unit from 2009 to 2010. {INTERVENTION}: None. {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Vital signs and laboratory values were obtained from the electronic medical record system and then used as predictors (features). A neural network was used to build a model to predict clinical deterioration events ({ICU} transfer and cardiac arrest). The performance of the neural network model was compared to the {VitalPac} Early Warning Score ({ViEWS}). Five hundred sixty five consecutive total admissions were available with 43 admissions resulting in clinical deterioration. Using simulation, the neural network outperformed the {ViEWS} model with a positive predictive value of 82\% compared to 24\%, respectively. {CONCLUSION}: We developed and tested a neural network-based prediction model for clinical deterioration in patients hospitalized in the hematologic malignancy unit. Our neural network model outperformed an existing model, substantially increasing the positive predictive value, allowing the clinician to be confident in the alarm raised. This system can be readily implemented in a real-time fashion in existing {EMR} systems.},

	abstract = {During progression of atherosclerosis, myeloid cells destabilize lipid-rich plaques in the arterial wall and cause their rupture, thus triggering myocardial infarction and stroke. Survivors of acute coronary syndromes have a high risk of recurrent events for unknown reasons. Here we show that the systemic response to ischaemic injury aggravates chronic atherosclerosis. After myocardial infarction or stroke, Apoe-/- mice developed larger atherosclerotic lesions with a more advanced morphology. This disease acceleration persisted over many weeks and was associated with markedly increased monocyte recruitment. Seeking the source of surplus monocytes in plaques, we found that myocardial infarction liberated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from bone marrow niches via sympathetic nervous system signalling. The progenitors then seeded the spleen, yielding a sustained boost in monocyte production. These observations provide new mechanistic insight into atherogenesis and provide a novel therapeutic opportunity to mitigate disease progression.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: As the prevalence of obesity has increased in the United States, it is likely that the prevalence of obesity among people with hypertension has increased as well. Because little is known about this issue, our objective was to compare secular trends in the prevalence of obesity and abdominal obesity among hypertensive and nonhypertensive adults in the United States. {METHODS}: We used data from adults aged 18-74 years who participated in National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ({NHANESs}) during 1976-1980, 1988-1994, and 1999-2004. {RESULTS}: Among adults with hypertension, the age-adjusted mean body mass index increased from 27.5 kg/m2 during 1976-1980 to 31.2 kg/m2 during 1999-2004 (P {\textless} 0.001), and the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity increased from 25.7-50.8\% (P {\textless} 0.001). Among adults without hypertension, mean body mass index increased from 24.2-27.1 kg/m2 (P {\textless} 0.001), and the prevalence of obesity increased from 8.4-25.1\% (P {\textless} 0.001). The prevalence of obesity among women with hypertension exceeded that among men with hypertension during all three surveys (P {\textless} 0.05 for all three surveys). During 1999-2004, 56.4\% (s.e. 3.4) of women with hypertension were obese compared with 46.9\% (s.e. 2.1) of men. During this same time period, the prevalence of obesity was highest among Mexican-American women with hypertension (63.8\%; s.e. 4.2) and lowest among African-American men with hypertension (43.8\%; s.e. 2.5). {CONCLUSIONS}: Over half of people with hypertension are currently obese. The large increase in obesity among people with hypertension presents clinicians with a serious challenge in the management of hypertension.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Current blood pressure ({BP}) management guidelines recommend that treatment thresholds for {BP} be based on absolute cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) risk rather than on elevated {BP} levels alone. Clinicians are concerned that delayed pharmacotherapy in individuals with high {BP}, but low {CVD} risk, may increase long-term {CVD} events. To investigate this, we examined differences in {CVD} events within the Second Australian National {BP} study ({ANBP}2) for those previously on pharmacotherapy and those who were not, as well as fatal events in the 6-year post-trial period. {METHODS}: Population consisted of {ANBP}2 participants without a prior {CVD} event. Adjusted Cox-regression hazard models were used to assess the effects of prior {BP} pharmacotherapy use on cardiovascular endpoints within {ANBP}2. An extended 6-year follow-up analysis for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality was also conducted. {RESULTS}: We found a higher in-trial {CVD} and all-cause mortality rate and incidence of new-onset diabetes for those on previous treatment versus those who were treatment-naive. We investigated whether this was an effect of the in-trial protocol, but this did not explain the observed differences. No difference in {CVD} or all-cause mortality at 10 years was observed between 'treatment-naive' and 'previous treatment' groups. {CONCLUSION}: We found no long-term adverse mortality associated with treatment naivety of elevated {BP} in an elderly hypertensive cohort, but this finding is likely to be confounded as seen by the lower in-trial mortality in the 'treatment-naive' group.

After adjusting for age and race differences, {HTN}-G patients reported significantly more symptoms (8.8 +/- 7.8 vs 4.7 +/- 4.8, P = 0.001) and related distress (32.2 +/- 4.2 vs 12.0 +/- 18.2, P = 0.001) as well as lower scores (reduced {HQL}) for most of the {SF}-36 domains. In general, hypertensive patients had more physical, but not mental symptoms than control patients. {CONCLUSIONS}: Hypertensive patients receiving antihypertensive medications have more symptoms and lower {HQL}. Differences were detected by both a brief, general {HQL} instrument and a detailed, disease-specific instrument. Routine screening of treated hypertensive patients using a brief {HQL} questionnaire to detect physical symptoms may prove feasible and useful.},

We randomized 524 patients to {LCI}699 0.25 mg once daily (n=92), 0.5 mg once daily (n=88), 1.0 mg once daily (n=86), and 0.5 mg twice daily (n=97); eplerenone 50 mg twice daily (n=84); or placebo (n=77) for 8 weeks. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (250 μg {IV}) stimulation testing was performed in a subset of patients to quantify the selectivity of {LCI}699 for aldosterone synthase compared with 11-β-hydroxylase. Reductions in clinic diastolic blood pressure were significant for {LCI}699 1.0 mg (-7.1 mm Hg; P=0.0012) and eplerenone 50 mg twice daily (-7.9 mm Hg; P{\textless}0.0001) compared with placebo (-2.6 mm Hg) but not other doses of {LCI}699. Significant reductions in clinic systolic blood pressure were observed with all doses of {LCI}699 (P{\textless}0.005 or better) and eplerenone (P{\textless}0.0001). All doses of {LCI}699 significantly reduced 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure compared with placebo (P{\textless}0.01). Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation of cortisol was suppressed in ≈20\% of subjects receiving {LCI}699 at a total daily dose of 1.0 mg. Safety and tolerability were similar among {LCI}699, placebo, and eplerenone.{\textbar}Aldosterone synthase inhibition with {LCI}699 significantly lowered clinic and ambulatory blood pressure. A minority of subjects developed blunted adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulated release of cortisol. These results support additional research to evaluate use of aldosterone synthase inhibition in primary hypertension and/or patients characterized by aldosterone excess.

We evaluated the effects of eplerenone in patients with chronic systolic heart failure and mild symptoms. {METHODS}: In this randomized, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 2737 patients with New York Heart Association class {II} heart failure and an ejection fraction of no more than 35\% to receive eplerenone (up to 50 mg daily) or placebo, in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure. {RESULTS}: The trial was stopped prematurely, according to prespecified rules, after a median follow-up period of 21 months. The primary outcome occurred in 18.3\% of patients in the eplerenone group as compared with 25.9\% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.54 to 0.74; P{\textless}0.001).

	abstract = {Abstract: Background:​ The {SARS}-Cov2 virus binds to the {ACE}2 receptor for cell entry. It has been suggested that {ACE}-inhibitors, which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and which raise {ACE}2 levels, may increase the risk of severe {COVID}-19 infection. Methods:​ We evaluated this hypothesis in an early cohort of 205 acute inpatients with {COVID}-19 at King's College Hospital and Princess Royal University Hospital, London, {UK} with the primary endpoint being death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 7-days of symptom onset. Findings:​ 53 patients out of 205 patients reached the primary endpoint. Contrary to the hypothesis, treatment with {ACE}-inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of rapidly deteriorating severe disease. There was a lower rate of death or transfer to a critical care unit within 7 days in patients on an {ACE}-inhibitor {OR} 0​.​29 ({CI} 0​.​10-0​.​75, p{\textless}0​.0​1), adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease and heart failure). Interpretation:​ Although a small sample size, we do not see evidence for {ACE}-inhibitors increasing the short-term severity of {COVID}-19 disease and patients on treatment with {ACE}-inhibitors should continue these drugs during their {COVID}-19 illness.

However, much of the prevalence, predictors, and outcomes are largely unknown, especially in patients with coronary artery disease. {METHODS}: We evaluated 10,001 patients with coronary artery disease who were enrolled in the Treating to New Targets trial. Apparent treatment-resistant hypertension was defined as blood pressure {\textgreater}/= 140 mm Hg despite 3 antihypertensive agents or {\textless}140 mm Hg with {\textgreater}/= 4 antihypertensive agents. The primary outcome was major cardiovascular events (composite of fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and stroke). {RESULTS}: Among the 10,001 patients in the trial, 1112 (11.1\%) had apparent treatment-resistant hypertension.

	abstract = {The Health and Retirement Study ({HRS}) is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of more than 37 000 individuals over age 50 in 23 000 households in the {USA}. The survey, which has been fielded every 2 years since 1992, was established to provide a national resource for data on the changing health and economic circumstances associated with ageing at both individual and population levels. Its multidisciplinary approach is focused on four broad topics-income and wealth; health, cognition and use of healthcare services; work and retirement; and family connections. {HRS} data are also linked at the individual level to administrative records from Social Security and Medicare, Veteran's Administration, the National Death Index and employer-provided pension plan information. Since 2006, data collection has expanded to include biomarkers and genetics as well as much greater depth in psychology and social context.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Framingham-based and Reynolds Risk scores for cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) prediction have not been directly compared in an independent validation cohort. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We selected a case-cohort sample of the multiethnic Women's Health Initiative Observational Cohort, comprising 1722 cases of major {CVD} (752 myocardial infarctions, 754 ischemic strokes, and 216 other {CVD} deaths) and a random subcohort of 1994 women without prior {CVD}. We estimated risk using the Adult Treatment Panel {III} ({ATP}-{III}) score, the Reynolds Risk Score, and the Framingham {CVD} model, reweighting to reflect cohort frequencies. Predicted 10-year risk varied widely between models, with {\textgreater}/=10\% risk in 6\%, 10\%, and 41\% of women with the {ATP}-{III}, Reynolds, and Framingham {CVD} models, respectively. Calibration was adequate for the Reynolds model, but the {ATP}-{III} and Framingham {CVD} models overestimated risk for coronary heart disease and major {CVD}, respectively. After recalibration, the Reynolds model demonstrated improved discrimination over the {ATP}-{III} model through a higher c statistic (0.765 versus 0.757; P=0.03), positive net reclassification improvement ({NRI}; 4.9\%; P=0.02), and positive integrated discrimination improvement (4.1\%; P{\textless}0.0001) overall, excluding diabetics ({NRI}=4.2\%; P=0.01), and in white ({NRI}=4.3\%; P=0.04) and black ({NRI}=11.4\%; P=0.13) women. The Reynolds ({NRI}=12.9\%; P{\textless}0.0001) and {ATP}-{III} ({NRI}=5.9\%; P=0.0001) models demonstrated better discrimination than the Framingham {CVD} model. {CONCLUSIONS}: The Reynolds Risk Score was better calibrated than the Framingham-based models in this large external validation cohort. The Reynolds score also showed improved discrimination overall and in black and white women. Large differences in risk estimates exist between models, with clinical implications for statin therapy.},

	abstract = {The basic objective of this paper is to evaluate an age-comorbidity index in a cohort of patients who were originally enrolled in a prospective study to identify risk factors for peri-operative complications. Two-hundred and twenty-six patients were enrolled in the study. The participants were patients with hypertension or diabetes who underwent elective surgery between 1982 and 1985 and who survived to discharge. Two-hundred and eighteen patients survived until discharge. These patients were followed for at least five years post-operatively. The estimated relative risk of death for each comorbidity rank was 1.4 and for each decade of age was 1.4. When age and comorbidity were modelled as a combined age-comorbidity score, the estimated relative risk for each combined age-comorbidity unit was 1.45. Thus, the estimated relative risk of death from an increase of one in the comorbidity score proved approximately equal to that from an additional decade of age. The combined age-comorbidity score may be useful in some longitudinal studies to estimate relative risk of death from prognostic clinical covariates.},

	abstract = {Body sodium works together with the plasma renin-angiotensin system to ensure adequate blood flow to the tissues. Body sodium content determines the extracellular fluid ({ECF}) volume ensuring that, with each heart beat, a sufficient volume of fluid is delivered into the arterial space. At the same time the kidneys monitor {ECF} volume and blood pressure ({BP}), so that the juxtaglomerular cells can adjust their net secretion rate of renin to maintain an appropriate plasma renin activity ({PRA}) level. Plasma renin produces angiotensin {II} (Ang {II}) to constrict the arterioles and thereby ensure sufficient {BP} to deliver an appropriate rate of flow for cardiovascular homeostasis. The low renin, sodium-volume dependent (V) form of essential hypertension occurs whenever body sodium content increases beyond the point where plasma renin-angiotensin vasoconstrictor activity is turned off. In contrast, medium to high renin (R) hypertension occurs when too much renin is secreted relative to the body sodium content. Thus, {BP} = V × R. This volume-vasoconstriction dual support of long-term hypertension is validated by the fact that all effective long-term antihypertensive drug types are either (i) natriuretic to reduce body salt and volume content (anti-V), or (ii) antirenin to reduce or block the activity of the circulating renin-angiotensin system (anti-R). The {PRA} test defines the relative participation of the concurrent volume and vasoconstrictor factors. In the hypertensive patient {PRA} testing can guide initiation, addition or subtraction of anti-V or anti-R antihypertensive drug types to thereby improve {BP} control and prognosis while reducing drug type usage and cost.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}: Establishing relative benefit or harm from specific antihypertensive agents is limited by the complex array of studies that compare treatments. Network meta-analysis combines direct and indirect evidence to better define risk or benefit. {OBJECTIVE}: To summarize the available clinical trial evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents and evaluated in terms of major cardiovascular disease end points and all-cause mortality. {DATA} {SOURCES} {AND} {STUDY} {SELECTION}: We used previous meta-analyses, {MEDLINE} searches, and journal reviews from January 1995 through December 2002. We identified long-term randomized controlled trials that assessed major cardiovascular disease end points as an outcome. Eligible studies included both those with placebo-treated or untreated controls and those with actively treated controls. {DATA} {EXTRACTION}: Network meta-analysis was used to combine direct within-trial between-drug comparisons with indirect evidence from the other trials. The indirect comparisons, which preserve the within-trial randomized findings, were constructed from trials that had one treatment in common. {DATA} {SYNTHESIS}: Data were combined from 42 clinical trials that included 192 478 patients randomized to 7 major treatment strategies, including placebo. For all outcomes, low-dose diuretics were superior to placebo: coronary heart disease ({CHD}; {RR}, 0.79; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.69-0.92); congestive heart failure ({CHF}; {RR}, 0.51; 95\% {CI}, 0.42-0.62); stroke ({RR}, 0.71; 0.63-0.81); cardiovascular disease events ({RR}, 0.76; 95\% {CI}, 0.69-0.83); cardiovascular disease mortality ({RR}, 0.81; 95\% {CI}, 0.73-0.92); and total mortality ({RR}, 0.90; 95\% {CI}, 0.84-0.96). None of the first-line treatment strategies-beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers ({CCBs}), alpha-blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers-was significantly better than low-dose diuretics for any outcome. Compared with {CCBs}, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease events ({RR}, 0.94; 95\% {CI}, 0.89-1.00) and {CHF} ({RR}, 0.74; 95\% {CI}, 0.67-0.81). Compared with {ACE} inhibitors, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of {CHF} ({RR}, 0.88; 95\% {CI}, 0.80-0.96), cardiovascular disease events ({RR}, 0.94; 95\% {CI}, 0.89-1.00), and stroke ({RR}, 0.86; 0.77-0.97). Compared with beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease events ({RR}, 0.89; 95\% {CI}, 0.80-0.98). Compared with alpha-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of {CHF} ({RR}, 0.51; 95\% {CI}, 0.43-0.60) and cardiovascular disease events ({RR}, 0.84; 95\% {CI}, 0.75-0.93). Blood pressure changes were similar between comparison treatments. {CONCLUSIONS}: Low-dose diuretics are the most effective first-line treatment for preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice and treatment guidelines should reflect this evidence, and future trials should use low-dose diuretics as the standard for clinically useful comparisons.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events; whether treatment with continuous positive airway pressure ({CPAP}) prevents major cardiovascular events is uncertain. {METHODS}: After a 1-week run-in period during which the participants used sham {CPAP}, we randomly assigned 2717 eligible adults between 45 and 75 years of age who had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and coronary or cerebrovascular disease to receive {CPAP} treatment plus usual care ({CPAP} group) or usual care alone (usual-care group). The primary composite end point was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or transient ischemic attack. Secondary end points included other cardiovascular outcomes, health-related quality of life, snoring symptoms, daytime sleepiness, and mood. {RESULTS}: Most of the participants were men who had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and minimal sleepiness. In the {CPAP} group, the mean duration of adherence to {CPAP} therapy was 3.3 hours per night, and the mean apnea-hypopnea index (the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour of recording) decreased from 29.0 events per hour at baseline to 3.7 events per hour during follow-up. After a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, a primary end-point event had occurred in 229 participants in the {CPAP} group (17.0\%) and in 207 participants in the usual-care group (15.4\%) (hazard ratio with {CPAP}, 1.10; 95\% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.32; P=0.34). No significant effect on any individual or other composite cardiovascular end point was observed. {CPAP} significantly reduced snoring and daytime sleepiness and improved health-related quality of life and mood. {CONCLUSIONS}: Therapy with {CPAP} plus usual care, as compared with usual care alone, did not prevent cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and established cardiovascular disease.

Understanding the sources of variation and identifying contextual factors associated with poor {CVH} may suggest important avenues for prevention. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Cross-sectional data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for the year 2011 were linked to state-level coronary heart disease and stroke mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System and to state-level measures of median household income, income inequality, taxes on soda drinks and cigarettes, and food and physical activity environments from various administrative sources. Poor {CVH} was defined according to the American Heart Association definition using 7 self-reported {CVH} metrics (current smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, poor diet, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol). Linked micromap plots and multilevel logistic models were used to examine state variation in poor {CVH} and to investigate the contributions of individual- and state-level factors to this variation. We found significant state-level variation in the prevalence of poor {CVH} (median odds ratio 1.32, P{\textless}0.001). Higher rates of poor {CVH} and cardiovascular disease mortality were clustered in the southern states. Minority and low socioeconomic groups were strongly associated with poor {CVH} and explained 44\% of the state-level variation in poor {CVH}; state-level factors explained an additional 28\%. State-level median household income (odds ratio 0.89; 95\% {CI} 0.84-0.94), taxes on soda drinks (odds ratio 0.94; 95\% {CI} 0.89-0.99), farmers markets (odds ratio 0.91; 95\% {CI} 0.85-0.98), and convenience stores (odds ratio 1.09; 95\% {CI} 1.01-1.17) were predictive of poor {CVH} even after accounting for individual-level factors. {CONCLUSIONS}: There is significant state-level variation in poor {CVH} that is partly explained by individual- and state-level factors. Additional longitudinal research is warranted to examine the influence of state-level policies and food and physical activity environments on poor {CVH}.},

Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games - tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus, part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome.},

In 6505 patients we analysed a total of 30948 years of patient follow-up, median survival was 101.9 months ( approximately 8.5 years), with 44.8\% of patients alive after 10 years and 21.4\% alive after 20 years. In all subgroups women had a significantly longer survival than men (118 vs 91.7 months, P{\textless}0.0001), despite a markedly higher age at implantation (73.2 years vs 71 years, P{\textless}0.0001). Survival of patients with sick-sinus-syndrome was significantly better than in patients with high degree {AV}-block, which in turn, was better than survival of patients with atrial fibrillation (132.9 months vs 94.2 months vs 85.1 months, P{\textless}0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed several independent factors: age, gender, decade of implantation, type of pacemaker, index arrhythmia and initial symptoms. Interestingly, if only the patients of the last decade were analysed multivariately, neither pacing mode nor index arrhythmia were independently associated with survival. In conclusion, survival of patients with pacemakers is independently influenced by several baseline characteristics which can identify patients with very long survival.},

	abstract = {Although resistant hypertension affects a minority of all hypertensives, this group continues to experience disproportionately high cardiovascular event rates despite newer antihypertensive agents. Hypertension represents an imbalance of hemodynamic forces within the circulation, usually characterized by elevated systemic vascular resistance. We studied the utility of serial hemodynamic parameters in the selection and titration of antihypertensive medication in resistant hypertensive patients using highly reproducible noninvasive measurements by thoracic bioimpedance. Resistant hypertension patients (n=104) were randomized to drug selection based either on serial hemodynamic ({HD}) measurements and a predefined algorithm or on drug selection directed by a hypertension specialist ({SC}) in a 3-month intensive treatment program. Blood pressure was lowered by intensified drug therapy in both treatment groups (169+/-3/87+/-2 to 139+/-2/72+/-1 mm Hg {HD} versus 173+/-3/91+/-2 to 147+/-2/79+/-1 mm Hg {SC}, P{\textless}0.01 for systolic and diastolic {BP}), using similar numbers and intensity of antihypertensive medications. Blood pressures were reduced further for those treated according to hemodynamic measurements, resulting in improved control rates (56\% {HD} versus 33\% {SC} controlled to {\textless}/=140/90 mm Hg, P{\textless}0.05) and incremental reduction in systemic vascular resistance measurements. Although the number of patients taking diuretics did not differ between groups, final diuretic dosage was higher in the hemodynamic cohort. Our results demonstrate superior blood pressure control using a treatment algorithm and serial hemodynamic measurements compared with clinical judgment alone in a randomized prospective study.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors reduce major cardiovascular events, but are not tolerated by about 20\% of patients. We therefore assessed whether the angiotensin-receptor blocker telmisartan would be effective in patients intolerant to {ACE} inhibitors with cardiovascular disease or diabetes with end-organ damage. {METHODS}: After a 3-week run-in period, 5926 patients, many of whom were receiving concomitant proven therapies, were randomised to receive telmisartan 80 mg/day (n=2954) or placebo (n=2972) by use of a central automated randomisation system. Randomisation was stratified by hospital. The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalisation for heart failure. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}00153101. {FINDINGS}: The median duration of follow-up was 56 ({IQR} 51-64) months. All randomised patients were included in the efficacy analyses. Mean blood pressure was lower in the telmisartan group than in the placebo group throughout the study (weighted mean difference between groups 4.0/2.2 [{SD} 19.6/12.0] mm Hg). 465 (15.7\%) patients experienced the primary outcome in the telmisartan group compared with 504 (17.0\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.92, 95\% {CI} 0.81-1.05, p=0.216). One of the secondary outcomes-a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke-occurred in 384 (13.0\%) patients on telmisartan compared with 440 (14.8\%) on placebo (0.87, 0.76-1.00, p=0.048 unadjusted; p=0.068 after adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons and overlap with primary outcome). 894 (30.3\%) patients receiving telmisartan were hospitalised for a cardiovascular reason, compared with 980 (33.0\%) on placebo (relative risk 0.92, 95\% {CI} 0.85-0.99; p=0.025). Fewer patients permanently discontinued study medication in the telmisartan group than in the placebo group (639 [21.6\%] vs 705 [23.8\%]; p=0.055); the most common reason for permanent discontinuation was hypotensive symptoms (29 [0.98\%] in the telmisartan group vs 16 [0.54\%] in the placebo group). {INTERPRETATION}: Telmisartan was well tolerated in patients unable to tolerate {ACE} inhibitors. Although the drug had no significant effect on the primary outcome of this study, which included hospitalisations for heart failure, it modestly reduced the risk of the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. {FUNDING}: Boehringer Ingelheim.},

	abstract = {Hyponatremia is a common cause of morbidity in the elderly, and thiazide diuretics are often implicated. Eleven healthy young volunteers, eight healthy old volunteers, and five elderly patients with a history of thiazide-induced hyponatremia were studied to determine susceptibility to thiazide-induced hypoosmolality in age. Each of the healthy subjects ingested a water load (20 {mL}/kg) after 3 days of hydrochlorothiazide ({HCTZ}) (100 mg/day) or placebo. Although there were no differences in minimum Uosm between young and old, the healthy old had lower hourly free water clearances ({CH}2O) as compared with the young and a greater decline in serum osmolality in response to water loading (P {\textless} 0.05). {HCTZ} impaired minimum urine osmolality and {CH}2O and delayed recovery of serum osmolality after the water load in both healthy young and old (P {\textless} 0.005, placebo versus {HCTZ}), but the impairment in the latter two parameters was greater in the healthy elderly (P {\textless} 0.05, young versus old). Vasopressin levels were not different between healthy young and old (1.9 +/- 0.3 versus 2.0 +/- 1.0 pm with placebo; 3.0 +/- 0.7 versus 4.4 +/- 1.0 with {HCTZ}). Five of the young subjects were restudied after the addition of ibuprofen (400 mg thrice daily) to the thiazide and placebo regimens. Creatinine clearance was not changed, but free water clearance and serum osmolality after water loading were significantly reduced to a degree similar to that seen in the elderly subjects on the thiazide regimen (P {\textless} 0.05), suggesting an important role for renal prostaglandins in the defense against hyponatremia.},

Arm circumference ranged from 22-38 cm. Resting systolic blood pressure ({BP}) ranged from 91-252 {mmHg}, and resting diastolic pressure ranged from 57-160 {mmHg}. There were 44 males, and 41 females. For each subject the readings obtained by the {PS}-2000 were compared with auscultatory readings obtained by two clinicians, blinded to the results of each other and the device. The manual reference measurements were alternated with the readings obtained by the device. {RESULTS}: The average differences between the reference readings (average of the two clinicians) using the {AAMI} analysis and the automated readings were 0.07+/-7.0 {mmHg} (Mean+/-{SD}) for systolic {BP}, and -0.3+/-6.6 {mmHg} for diastolic {BP}. {CONCLUSIONS}: The device met the accuracy requirements of the {AAMI} standard. In addition, when the data were analyzed to assess the compliance with the current British Hypertension Society Protocol ({BHS}), the device earned the highest rating of 'A' for both systolic and diastolic pressure.

We sought to evaluate whether unbiased clustering analysis using dense phenotypic data (phenomapping) could identify phenotypically distinct {HFpEF} categories. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We prospectively studied 397 patients with {HFpEF} and performed detailed clinical, laboratory, {ECG}, and echocardiographic phenotyping of the study participants. We used several statistical learning algorithms, including unbiased hierarchical cluster analysis of phenotypic data (67 continuous variables) and penalized model-based clustering, to define and characterize mutually exclusive groups making up a novel classification of {HFpEF}. All phenomapping analyses were performed by investigators blinded to clinical outcomes, and Cox regression was used to demonstrate the clinical validity of phenomapping. The mean age was 65+/-12 years; 62\% were female; 39\% were black; and comorbidities were common. Although all patients met published criteria for the diagnosis of {HFpEF}, phenomapping analysis classified study participants into 3 distinct groups that differed markedly in clinical characteristics, cardiac structure/function, invasive hemodynamics, and outcomes (eg, phenogroup 3 had an increased risk of {HF} hospitalization [hazard ratio, 4.2; 95\% confidence interval, 2.0-9.1] even after adjustment for traditional risk factors [P{\textless}0.001]). The {HFpEF} phenogroup classification, including its ability to stratify risk, was successfully replicated in a prospective validation cohort (n=107). {CONCLUSIONS}: Phenomapping results in a novel classification of {HFpEF}.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Lower extremity peripheral artery disease is the third leading cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity, following coronary artery disease and stroke. This study provides the first comparison of the prevalence of peripheral artery disease between high-income countries ({HIC}) and low-income or middle-income countries ({LMIC}), establishes the primary risk factors for peripheral artery disease in these settings, and estimates the number of people living with peripheral artery disease regionally and globally. {METHODS}: We did a systematic review of the literature on the prevalence of peripheral artery disease in which we searched for community-based studies since 1997 that defined peripheral artery disease as an ankle brachial index ({ABI}) lower than or equal to 0.90. We used epidemiological modelling to define age-specific and sex-specific prevalence rates in {HIC} and in {LMIC} and combined them with {UN} population numbers for 2000 and 2010 to estimate the global prevalence of peripheral artery disease. Within a subset of studies, we did meta-analyses of odds ratios ({ORs}) associated with 15 putative risk factors for peripheral artery disease to estimate their effect size in {HIC} and {LMIC}. We then used the risk factors to predict peripheral artery disease numbers in eight {WHO} regions (three {HIC} and five {LMIC}). {FINDINGS}: 34 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, 22 from {HIC} and 12 from {LMIC}, including 112,027 participants, of which 9347 had peripheral artery disease. Sex-specific prevalence rates increased with age and were broadly similar in {HIC} and {LMIC} and in men and women. The prevalence in {HIC} at age 45-49 years was 5.28\% (95\% {CI} 3.38-8.17\%) in women and 5.41\% (3.41-8.49\%) in men, and at age 85-89 years, it was 18.38\% (11.16-28.76\%) in women and 18.83\% (12.03-28.25\%) in men. Prevalence in men was lower in {LMIC} than in {HIC} (2.89\% [2.04-4.07\%] at 45-49 years and 14.94\% [9.58-22.56\%] at 85-89 years). In {LMIC}, rates were higher in women than in men, especially at younger ages (6.31\% [4.86-8.15\%] of women aged 45-49 years). Smoking was an important risk factor in both {HIC} and {LMIC}, with meta-{OR} for current smoking of 2.72 (95\% {CI} 2.39-3.09) in {HIC} and 1.42 (1.25-1.62) in {LMIC}, followed by diabetes (1.88 [1.66-2.14] vs 1.47 [1.29-1.68]), hypertension (1.55 [1.42-1.71] vs 1.36 [1.24-1.50]), and hypercholesterolaemia (1.19 [1.07-1.33] vs 1.14 [1.03-1.25]). Globally, 202 million people were living with peripheral artery disease in 2010, 69.7\% of them in {LMIC}, including 54.8 million in southeast Asia and 45.9 million in the western Pacific Region. During the preceding decade the number of individuals with peripheral artery disease increased by 28.7\% in {LMIC} and 13.1\% in {HIC}. {INTERPRETATION}: In the 21st century, peripheral artery disease has become a global problem. Governments, non-governmental organisations, and the private sector in {LMIC} need to address the social and economic consequences, and assess the best strategies for optimum treatment and prevention of this disease. {FUNDING}: Peripheral Arterial Disease Research Coalition (Europe).},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The disease risks from cigarette smoking increased in the United States over most of the 20th century, first among male smokers and later among female smokers. Whether these risks have continued to increase during the past 20 years is unclear. {METHODS}: We measured temporal trends in mortality across three time periods (1959-1965, 1982-1988, and 2000-2010), comparing absolute and relative risks according to sex and self-reported smoking status in two historical cohort studies and in five pooled contemporary cohort studies, among participants who became 55 years of age or older during follow-up. {RESULTS}: For women who were current smokers, as compared with women who had never smoked, the relative risks of death from lung cancer were 2.73, 12.65, and 25.66 in the 1960s, 1980s, and contemporary cohorts, respectively; corresponding relative risks for male current smokers, as compared with men who had never smoked, were 12.22, 23.81, and 24.97. In the contemporary cohorts, male and female current smokers also had similar relative risks for death from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) (25.61 for men and 22.35 for women), ischemic heart disease (2.50 for men and 2.86 for women), any type of stroke (1.92 for men and 2.10 for women), and all causes combined (2.80 for men and 2.76 for women). Mortality from {COPD} among male smokers continued to increase in the contemporary cohorts in nearly all the age groups represented in the study and within each stratum of duration and intensity of smoking. Among men 55 to 74 years of age and women 60 to 74 years of age, all-cause mortality was at least three times as high among current smokers as among those who had never smoked. Smoking cessation at any age dramatically reduced death rates. {CONCLUSIONS}: The risk of death from cigarette smoking continues to increase among women and the increased risks are now nearly identical for men and women, as compared with persons who have never smoked. Among men, the risks associated with smoking have plateaued at the high levels seen in the 1980s, except for a continuing, unexplained increase in mortality from {COPD}.},

	abstract = {Aggressive resuscitation can decrease sepsis mortality, but its success depends on early detection of sepsis. The purpose of this study was to develop and verify an Automated Sepsis Risk Assessment System (Auto-{SepRAS}), which would automatically assess the sepsis risk of inpatients by applying data mining techniques to electronic health records ({EHR}) data and provide daily updates. The seven predictors included in the Auto-{SepRAS} after initial analysis were admission via the emergency department, which had the highest odds ratio; diastolic blood pressure; length of stay; respiratory rate; heart rate; and age. Auto-{SepRAS} classifies inpatients into three risk levels (high, moderate, and low) based on the predictive values from the sepsis risk-scoring algorithm. The sepsis risk for each patient is presented on the nursing screen of the {EHR}. The {AutoSepRAS} was implemented retrospectively in several stages using {EHR} data and its cut-off scores adjusted. Overall discrimination power was moderate ({AUC}{\textgreater}.80). The Auto-{SepRAS} should be verified or updated continuously or intermittently to maintain high predictive performance, but it does not require invasive tests or data input by nurses that would require additional time. Nurses are able to provide patients with nursing care appropriate to their risk levels by using the sepsis risk information provided by the Auto-{SepRAS}. In particular, with early detection of changes related to sepsis, nurses should be able to help in providing rapid initial resuscitation of high-risk patients. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Of the 758 patients allocated to tight control of blood pressure, 400 were allocated to captopril and 358 to atenolol. 390 patients were allocated to less tight control of blood pressure. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Predefined clinical end points, fatal and non-fatal, related to diabetes, death related to diabetes, and all cause mortality. Surrogate measures of microvascular and macrovascular disease included urinary albumin excretion and retinopathy assessed by retinal photography. {RESULTS}: Captopril and atenolol were equally effective in reducing blood pressure to a mean of 144/83 mm Hg and 143/81 mm Hg respectively, with a similar proportion of patients (27\% and 31\%) requiring three or more antihypertensive treatments. More patients in the captopril group than the atenolol group took the allocated treatment: at their last clinic visit, 78\% of those allocated captopril and 65\% of those allocated atenolol were taking the drug (P{\textless}0.0001). Captopril and atenolol were equally effective in reducing the risk of macrovascular end points. Similar proportions of patients in the two groups showed deterioration in retinopathy by two grades after nine years (31\% in the captopril group and 37\% in the atenolol group) and developed clinical grade albuminuria {\textgreater}=300 mg/l (5\% and 9\%). The proportion of patients with hypoglycaemic attacks was not different between groups, but mean weight gain in the atenolol group was greater (3.4 kg v 1.6 kg). {CONCLUSION}: Blood pressure lowering with captopril or atenolol was similarly effective in reducing the incidence of diabetic complications. This study provided no evidence that either drug has any specific beneficial or deleterious effect, suggesting that blood pressure reduction in itself may be more important than the treatment used.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although it is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects. {OBJECTIVES}: To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids. {SEARCH} {METHODS}: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ({CENTRAL} 2014, Issue 1), Ovid {MEDLINE} (1946 to February 2014), Ovid {EMBASE} (1974 to February 2014) and {ClinicalTrials}.gov. {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: We included double-blind, randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) comparing fixed-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and determined risk of bias. We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference ({MD}) and for dichotomous outcomes we calculated the relative risk ratio ({RR}) with 95\% confidence interval ({CI}). {MAIN} {RESULTS}: We included 60 randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated the dose-related trough blood pressure-lowering efficacy of six different thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight weeks. The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 {mmHg}. Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90\%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes.In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 {mmHg}, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 2 to 6, moderate-quality evidence)/2 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 5 to 7, high-quality evidence)/3 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 3 to 4, high-quality evidence) and 11 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 3 to 7, low-quality evidence), respectively.Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other thiazides for which {RCT} data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide.In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 {mmHg}, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 10 to 14, low-quality evidence)/4 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 {mmHg}, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 7 to 10, low-quality evidence)/4 (95\% {CI} 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).We judged the maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar. Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} 3 to 4, high-quality evidence).Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 {mmHg} to 6 {mmHg}, an amount that is greater than the 3 {mmHg} seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers ({ARBs}) and renin inhibitors, and the 2 {mmHg} seen with non-selective beta-blockers. This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on {ACE} inhibitors, {ARBs} and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review.Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data. This review does not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects. {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: This systematic review shows that hydrochlorothiazide has a dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect. The mean blood pressure-lowering effect over the dose range 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 {mmHg}, 6/3 {mmHg}, 8/3 {mmHg} and 11/5 {mmHg}, respectively. For other thiazide drugs, the lowest doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it more. Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 {mmHg} to 6 {mmHg}. This exceeds the mean 3 {mmHg} pulse pressure reduction achieved by {ACE} inhibitors, {ARBs} and renin inhibitors, and the 2 {mmHg} pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria.Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.},

The objectives of the current study are to estimate the prevalence of resistant hypertension and examine factors associated with (1) lack of awareness and (2) uncontrolled hypertension despite pharmacotherapy. {METHODS}: Using the 2007-2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey (N = 3473, aged 20-79 years) and logistic regression, we quantified relationships between characteristics and (1) presence of hypertension, (2) lack of awareness (among those with hypertension), and (3) uncontrolled high blood pressure (among those treated for hypertension). {RESULTS}: Older age, lowest income, and less than high school education were associated with presence of hypertension. Men (odds ratio [{OR}], 1.6; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.1-2.2) and adults {\textless} 60 years ({OR}, 1.7; 95\% {CI}, 1.1-2.6) were more likely than others to be unaware. Among those aged 60+ years, women were more likely than men to have uncontrolled high blood pressure ({OR}, 2.4; 95\% {CI}, 1.1-5.2) despite treatment. Elevated systolic blood pressure was the issue in over 90\% of women and 80\% of men with uncontrolled hypertension. Depending on the definition employed, 4.4\% (95\% {CI}, 2.4-6.4) to 7.8\% (95\% {CI}, 6.0-9.6) of the population with hypertension had resistant hypertension. {CONCLUSIONS}: Messaging or interventions encouraging screening may be helpful for all younger Canadian adults and men; programs encouraging blood pressure control may help older women.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Blood pressure screening is an important component of cardiovascular disease prevention, but a hypertension diagnosis (i.e., label) can have unintended negative effects on patients' well-being. Despite persistent disparities in hypertension prevalence and outcomes, whether the impact of labeling differs by race is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate possible race differences in the relationship between hypertension labeling and health-related quality of life and depression. {METHODS}: The sample included 308 normotensive and unmedicated hypertensive subjects from the Neighborhood Study of Blood Pressure and Sleep, a cross-sectional study conducted between 1999 and 2003. Labeled hypertension was defined (by self-report) as having been diagnosed with high blood pressure or prescribed antihypertensive medications. Effects of labeling and race on self-reported physical and mental health and depressive symptoms were tested using multivariate analysis of covariance, controlling for age, sex, body mass index ({BMI}), previous medication use, and "true" hypertension status, defined by average daytime ambulatory blood pressure ({ABP}). {RESULTS}: Both black and white subjects who had been labeled as hypertensive reported similarly poorer physical health than unlabeled subjects (P = 0.001). However, labeling was associated with poorer mental health and greater depressive symptoms only among blacks (Ps {\textless} 0.05 for the interactions). These findings were not explained by differences in socioeconomic status. {CONCLUSIONS}: These results are consistent with previous studies showing negative effects of hypertension labeling, and demonstrate important race differences in these effects. Clinical approaches to communicating diagnostic information that avoid negative effects on well-being are needed, and may require tailoring to patient characteristics such as race.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: The Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation ({WISE}) is a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute-sponsored, four-center study designed to: 1) optimize symptom evaluation and diagnostic testing for ischemic heart disease; 2) explore mechanisms for symptoms and myocardial ischemia in the absence of epicardial coronary artery stenoses, and 3) evaluate the influence of reproductive hormones on symptoms and diagnostic test response. {BACKGROUND}: Accurate diagnosis of ischemic heart disease in women is a major challenge to physicians, and the role reproductive hormones play in this diagnostic uncertainty is unexplored. Moreover, the significance and pathophysiology of ischemia in the absence of significant epicardial coronary stenoses is unknown. {METHODS}: The {WISE} common core data include demographic and clinical data, symptom and psychosocial variables, coronary angiographic and ventriculographic data, brachial artery reactivity testing, resting/ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and a variety of blood determinations. Site-specific complementary methods include physiologic and functional cardiovascular assessments of myocardial perfusion and metabolism, ventriculography, endothelial vascular function and coronary angiography. Women are followed for at least 1 year to assess clinical events and symptom status. {RESULTS}: In Phase I (1996-1997), a pilot phase, 256 women were studied. These data indicate that the {WISE} protocol is safe and feasible for identifying symptomatic women with and without significant epicardial coronary artery stenoses. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {WISE} study will define contemporary diagnostic testing to evaluate women with suspected ischemic heart disease. Phase {II} (1997-1999) is ongoing and will study an additional 680 women, for a total {WISE} enrollment of 936 women. Phase {III} (2000) will include patient follow-up, data analysis and a National Institutes of Health {WISE} workshop.},

Patients previously treated with {ACEI}/{ARB} continuing treatment during hospitalization had a lower incidence of the composite outcome of prognosis than those whose treatment was withdrawn ({RR} 0.67, 95\%{CI} 0.63–0.76). {ARB} was associated with better survival than {ACEI} ({HR} 0.77, 95\%{CI} 0.62–0.96). {ACEI}/{ARB} treatment during {COVID}-19 hospitalization was associated with protection on mortality.

Although studies using more robust methodologies provided some clarity, sources of bias persist and it remains critical to quickly address this question. In this review, we discuss pernicious sources of bias using a causal model framework, including time-varying confounder, collider, information, and time-dependent bias, in the context of recently published studies. We discuss causal inference methodologies that can address these issues, including causal diagrams, time-to-event analyses, sensitivity analyses, and marginal structural modeling. We discuss effect modification and we propose a role for causal mediation analysis to estimate indirect effects via mediating factors, especially components of the renin--angiotensin system. Thorough knowledge of these sources of bias and the appropriate methodologies to address them is crucial when evaluating observational studies to inform patient management decisions regarding whether {ACE} inhibitors or {ARBs} are associated with greater risk from {COVID}-19.},

However, knowledge of the machinery of specific species isolated from humans (like Bacteroides uniformis) contributing to the utilization of dietary and endogenous sources of glycans and their byproducts is limited. We have used the cutting-edge nanopore-based technology to sequence the genome of B. uniformis {CECT} 7771, a human symbiont with a proven pre-clinical efficacy on metabolic and immune dysfunctions in obesity animal models. We have also used massive sequencing approaches to distinguish the genome expression patterns in response to carbon sources of different complexity during growth. At genome-wide level, our analyses globally demonstrate that B. uniformis strains exhibit an expanded glycolytic capability when compared with other Bacteroides species. Moreover, by studying the growth and whole-genome expression of B. uniformis {CECT} 7771 in response to different carbon sources, we detected a differential growth fitness and expression patterns across the genome depending on the carbon source of the culture media. The dietary fibers used exerted different effects on B. uniformis {CECT} 7771 activating different molecular pathways and, therefore, allowing the production of different metabolite types with potential impact on gut health. The genome and transcriptome analysis of B. uniformis {CECT} 7771, in response to different carbon sources, shows its high versatility to utilize both dietary and endogenous glycans along with the production of potentially beneficial end products for both the bacterium and the host, pointing to a mechanistic basis of a mutualistic relationship.},

The impact of gut microbiota on blood pressure and systemic vascular function, processes that are determined by immune cell function, is unknown. Methods and Results: Unchallenged germ-free mice ({GF}) had a dampened systemic T helper cell type 1 skewing compared to conventionally raised ({CONV}-R) mice. Colonization of {GF} mice with regular gut microbiota induced lymphoid {mRNA} transcription of T-box expression in T cells and resulted in mild endothelial dysfunction. Compared to {CONV}-R mice, angiotensin {II} ({AngII}; 1 mg/kg per day for 7 days) infused {GF} mice showed reduced reactive oxygen species formation in the vasculature, attenuated vascular {mRNA} expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ({MCP}-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase ({iNOS}) and {NADPH} oxidase subunit Nox2, as well as a reduced upregulation of retinoic-acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (Rorγt), the signature transcription factor for interleukin ({IL})-17 synthesis. This resulted in an attenuated vascular leukocyte adhesion, less infiltration of Ly6G+ neutrophils and Ly6C+ monocytes into the aortic vessel wall, protection from kidney inflammation, as well as endothelial dysfunction and attenuation of blood pressure increase in response to {AngII}. Importantly, cardiac inflammation, fibrosis and systolic dysfunction were attenuated in {GF} mice, indicating systemic protection from cardiovascular inflammatory stress induced by {AngII}. Conclusion: Gut microbiota facilitate {AngII}-induced vascular dysfunction and hypertension, at least in part, by supporting an {MCP}-1/{IL}-17 driven vascular immune cell infiltration and inflammation.},

The aim of the present study was to identify characteristics of individuals with high adherence to this dietary pattern. Design: We analyzed data from {REGARDS}, a national cohort of 30,239 black and white adults ≥ 45 years of age living in the {US}. Dietary data were collected using the Block 98 Food Frequency Questionnaire ({FFQ}). Multivariable linear regression was used to calculate standardized beta coefficients across all covariates for the entire sample and stratified by race and region. Results: We included 16,781 participants with complete dietary data. Among these, 34.6\% were black, 45.6\% male, 55.2\% resided in stroke belt region, and the average age was 65 years. Black race was the factor with the largest magnitude of association to the Southern dietary pattern (Δ= 0.76 {SD}, p {\textless} 0.0001). Large differences in Southern dietary pattern adherence were observed between black participants and white participants in the stroke belt and non-belt (stroke belt Δ= 0.75 {SD}, non-belt Δ= 0.77 {SD}).

	abstract = {In this review, we highlight that the relationship between muscle sympathetic nerve activity ({MSNA}) and mean arterial pressure is complex, differs by sex, and changes with age. In young men there is an inverse relationship between {MSNA} and cardiac output where high {MSNA} is compensated for by low cardiac output. This inverse relationship is not seen in older men. In young women sympathetic vasoconstriction is offset by ß-adreno-receptor mediated vasodilation, limiting the ability of young women to maintain blood pressure in response to orthostatic stress. However, ß-mediated dilation in women is attenuated with age, leading to unopposed α-adrenergic vasoconstriction and a rise in the direct transduction of {MSNA} into increases in blood pressure. We propose that these changes with age and menopausal status are major contributing factors in the increased prevalence of hypertension in older women. In addition to aging, we highlight that changes in sex hormones in young women (across the menstrual cycle, with oral contraceptive use, or with pregnancy) influence {MSNA} and the transduction of {MSNA} into increases in blood pressure. It is likely that the ß-adrenergic receptors and/or changes in baroreflex sensitivity play a large role in these sex differences and changes with alterations in sex hormones.},

	abstract = {Significance: Hypertension ({HTN}) has a complex etiology that is characterized by genetic and environmental factors. It has become a global health burden leading to cardiovascular diseases and kidney diseases, ultimately progressing to premature death. Accumulating evidence indicated that gut microbiome was associated with metabolic disorders and inflammation, which were closely linked to {HTN}. Recent Advances: Recent studies using bacterial genomic analysis and fecal microbiota transplantation as well as many lines of seminal evidence demonstrated that aberrant gut microbiome was significantly associated with {HTN}. The intestinal microbiome of both patients and animals with {HTN} had decreased bacterial diversity, disordered microbial structure and functions, and altered end products of fermentation. Gut dysbiosis and metabolites of the gut microbiota play an important role in blood pressure ({BP}) control, and they are therefore responsible for developing {HTN}. Critical Issues: This study aimed at focusing on the recent advances in understanding the role played by gut bacteria and the mechanisms underlying the pathological milieu that induced elevated {BP} and led to {HTN} pathogenesis. Potential intervention strategies targeting the correction of gut dysbiosis to improve {HTN} development were summarized. Future Directions: Larger numbers of fecal transplants from participants with {HTN} should be carried out to examine the magnitude of {BP} changes with the replacement of the gut microbiome. The proposed mechanisms for the gut in regulating {BP} remain to be verified. Whether intervention strategies using probiotics, dietary interventions, bacteriophages, and fecal transplants are feasible for individuals with {HTN} remains to be explored. Antioxid.

Although some data suggest a potential connection between biological sex differences and gut microbiota, the connection between sex steroid hormones and gut microbes remained unexplored. The current study investigates the relationship between gut microbes and serum levels of testosterone in men and estradiol in women. Fecal microbiota from a total of 57 men (n = 31) and women (n = 26) were assessed using 16s {rRNA} gene sequencing. Based on the levels of serum testosterone and estradiol in men and women, respectively, participants were stratified into three groups of Low, Medium, and High. Microbiome communities were analyzed as a function of the steroid hormone within sex. Men and women in the High group harbored more diverse gut microbial communities than others. In men, the abundance of Acinetobacter, Dorea, Ruminococcus, and Megamonas correlated significantly with testosterone levels. Women in the High group have more Bacteroidetes and less Firmicutes phyla than those in the Low group. Genera Slackia and Butyricimonas were significantly correlated with estradiol levels. These results demonstrate that sex steroid hormone levels are correlated with diversity and gut microbial composition, and provide fundamental information helpful for developing communication networks between human and microbial communities.},

Participants were given 3 levels of sodium (50, 100, and 150 mmol/2,100 kcal) for 30 days while consuming the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ({DASH}) diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy) or a more typical American diet. Within each diet and subgroup, there was a general pattern such that the lower the sodium level, the greater the mean reduction in {BP}. Sodium reduction from 100 to 50 mmol/2,100 kcal generally had twice the effect on {BP} as reduction from 150 to 100 mmol/2,100 kcal. Age had a strong and graded influence on the effect of sodium within the typical and {DASH} diets, respectively: -4.8 and -1.0 mm Hg systolic for 23 to 41 years, -5.9 and -1.8 mm Hg for 42 to 47 years, -7.5 and -4.3 mm Hg for 48 to 54 years, and -8.1 and -6.0 mm Hg for 55 to 76 years. The influence of age on the effect of sodium reduction was particularly strong in nonhypertensive patients: -3.7 mm Hg systolic for {\textless}45 years and -7.0 mm Hg for {\textgreater}45 years with the typical diet and -0.7 and -2.8 mm Hg with the {DASH} diet. Reduced sodium intake and the {DASH} diet should be advocated for the prevention and treatment of high {BP}, particularly because the benefits to {BP} strengthen as subjects enter middle age, when the rate of cardiovascular disease increases sharply. © 2004 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.},

	abstract = {Aging results in chronic systemic inflammation that can alter neuroinflammation of the brain. Specifically, microglia shift to a pro-inflammatory phenotype predisposing them to hyperactivation upon stimulation by peripheral immune signals. It is proposed that certain nutrients can delay brain aging by preventing or reversing microglial hyperactivation. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid ({SCFA}) produced primarily by bacterial fermentation of fiber in the colon, has been extensively studied pharmacologically as a histone deacetylase inhibitor and serves as an attractive therapeutic candidate, as butyrate has also been shown to be anti-inflammatory and improve memory in animal models. In this study, we demonstrate that butyrate can attenuate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in microglia in aged mice. It is still not fully understood, however, if an increase in butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut as a consequence of a diet high in soluble fiber could affect microglial activation during aging. Adult and aged mice were fed either a 1\% cellulose (low fiber) or 5\% inulin (high fiber) diet for 4 weeks. Findings indicate that mice fed inulin had an altered gut microbiome and increased butyrate, acetate, and total {SCFA} production. In addition, histological scoring of the distal colon demonstrated that aged animals on the low fiber diet had increased inflammatory infiltrate that was significantly reduced in animals consuming the high fiber diet. Furthermore, gene expression of inflammatory markers, epigenetic regulators, and the microglial sensory apparatus (i.e., the sensome) were altered by both diet and age, with aged animals exhibiting a more anti-inflammatory microglial profile on the high fiber diet. Taken together, high fiber supplementation in aging is a non-invasive strategy to increase butyrate levels, and these data suggest that an increase in butyrate through added soluble fiber such as inulin could counterbalance the age-related microbiota dysbiosis, potentially leading to neurological benefits.},

Methods and results: In human and rat fecalase incubation samples, amlodipine was metabolized to yield a major pyridine metabolite. The remaining amlodipine decreased and the formation of pyridine metabolite increased with incubation time, indicating the involvement of gut microbiota in the metabolism of amlodipine. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed that systemic exposure of amlodipine was significantly elevated in antibiotic-treated rats compared with controls. Conclusion: These results showed that antibiotic intake might increase the bioavailability of amlodipine by suppressing gut microbial metabolic activities, which could be followed by changes in therapeutic potency. Therefore, coadministration of amlodipine with antibiotics requires caution and clinical monitoring.},

However, few studies have characterized the underlying interaction between {GM} shift and vitamin D3 deficiency in {HTN} patients. Hypothesis: This study aimed to evaluate the possible crosstalk between {GM} dysbiosis and vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of {HTN}. Methods: In a cohort of 34 {HTN} patients and 15 healthy controls, we analyzed the fecal microbiota products, {GM} composition, and the interaction between {GM} and vitamin D3. Results: Vitamin D3 was significantly decreased in feces of {HTN} patients (P =.006, vs controls) and was correlated with altered {GM}, including decreased Shannon index (R2 = 0.1296, P =.0111) and Pielou evenness (R2 = 0.1509, P =.0058). Moreover, vitamin D3 positively correlated with {HTN}-reduced bacterial genera, including Subdoligranulum (R2 = 0.181, P =.0023), Ruminiclostridium (R2 = 0.1217, P =.014), Intestinimonas (R2 = 0.2036, P =.0011), Pseudoflavonifractor (R2 = 0.1014, P =.0257), Paenibacillus (R2 = 0.089, P =.0373), and Marvinbryantia (R2 = 0.08173, P =.0464). Partial least squares structural equation modeling showed that 27.7\% of the total effect of gut microbiome on {HTN} was mediated by limiting vitamin D production. Finally, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed the predictive capacity of differential gut microbiome signatures and decreased vitamin D3 to distinguish {HTN} patients ({AUC} = 0.749, P =.006). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the {GM} dysbiosis contributing to the development of {HTN} might be partially mediated by vitamin D3 deficiency. Future studies involving the underlying mechanism and intervention strategies targeting microbiome composition and vitamin D3 to counteract the progression of {HTN} are warranted.},

A vehicle, {BA}, or 3-hydroxybutyrate, an antagonist of {SCFA} receptors {GPR}41/43 ({ANT}) were administered intravenously ({IV}) or into the colon ({IC}). Reactivity of mesenteric ({MA}) and gracilis muscle ({GMA}) arteries was tested ex vivo. The concentration of {BA} in stools, urine, portal, and systemic blood was measured with liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. {BA} administered {IV} decreased {BP} with no significant effect on {HR}. The {ANT} reduced, whereas L-{NAME}, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, did not affect the hypotensive effect of {BA}. In comparison to {BA} administered intravenously, {BA} administered into the colon produced a significantly longer decrease in {BP} and a decrease in {HR}, which was associated with a 2–3-fold increase in {BA} colon content. Subphrenic vagotomy and {IC} pretreatment with the {ANT} significantly reduced the hypotensive effect. Ex vivo, {BA} dilated {MA} and {GMA}.

	abstract = {Neurons and glia exhibit metabolic imbalances in hypertensive animal models, and loss of metabolic homeostasis can lead to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of the microbial metabolite butyrate on mitochondrial bioenergetics and inflammatory markers in mixed brainstem and hypothalamic primary cultures of astrocytes between normotensive (Sprague-Dawley, S-D) and spontaneously hypertensive ({SHR}) rats. Bioenergetics of mitochondria in astrocytes from normotensive S-D rats were modified with butyrate, but this was not the case in astrocytes derived from {SHR}, suggesting aberrant mitochondrial function. Transcripts related to oxidative stress, butyrate transporters, butyrate metabolism, and neuroinflammation were quantified in astrocyte cultures treated with butyrate at 0, 200, 600, and 1000 μmol/L. Butyrate decreased catalase and monocarboxylate transporter 1 {mRNA} in astrocytes of S-D rats but not in the {SHR}. Moreover, while butyrate did not directly regulate the expression of 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 in astrocytes of either strain, the expression levels for these transcripts in untreated cultures were lower in the {SHR} compared to S-D. We observed higher levels of specific inflammatory cytokines in astrocytes of {SHR}, and treatment with butyrate decreased expression of Ccl2 and Tlr4 in {SHR} astrocytes only. Conversely, butyrate treatment increased expression of tumor necrosis factor in astrocytes from {SHR} but not from the S-D rats. This study improves our understanding of the role of microbial metabolites in regulating astrocyte function, and provides support that butyrate differentially regulates both the bioenergetics and transcripts related to neuroinflammation in astrocytes from {SHR} versus S-D rats.},

	abstract = {Background: Arterial hypertension and its organ sequelae show characteristics of T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases. Experimental anti-inflammatory therapies have been shown to ameliorate hypertensive end-organ damage. Recently, the {CANTOS} study (Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study) targeting interleukin-1β demonstrated that anti-inflammatory therapy reduces cardiovascular risk. The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in immune homeostasis and cardiovascular health. Short-chain fatty acids ({SCFAs}) are produced from dietary fiber by gut bacteria and affect host immune homeostasis. Here, we investigated effects of the {SCFA} propionate in 2 different mouse models of hypertensive cardiovascular damage. Methods: To investigate the effect of {SCFAs} on hypertensive cardiac damage and atherosclerosis, wild-type {NMRI} or apolipoprotein E knockout-deficient mice received propionate (200 mmol/L) or control in the drinking water. To induce hypertension, wild-type {NMRI} mice were infused with angiotensin {II} (1.44 mg·kg-1·d-1 subcutaneous) for 14 days. To accelerate the development of atherosclerosis, apolipoprotein E knockout mice were infused with angiotensin {II} (0.72 mg·kg-1·d-1 subcutaneous) for 28 days. Cardiac damage and atherosclerosis were assessed using histology, echocardiography, in vivo electrophysiology, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. Regulatory T cell depletion using {PC}61 antibody was used to examine the mode of action of propionate. Results: Propionate significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, vascular dysfunction, and hypertension in both models. Susceptibility to cardiac ventricular arrhythmias was significantly reduced in propionate-treated angiotensin {II}-infused wild-type {NMRI} mice. Aortic atherosclerotic lesion area was significantly decreased in propionate-treated apolipoprotein E knockout-deficient mice. Systemic inflammation was mitigated by propionate treatment, quantified as a reduction in splenic effector memory T cell frequencies and splenic T helper 17 cells in both models, and a decrease in local cardiac immune cell infiltration in wild-type {NMRI} mice. Cardioprotective effects of propionate were abrogated in regulatory T cell-depleted angiotensin {II}-infused mice, suggesting the effect is regulatory T cell-dependent. Conclusions: Our data emphasize an immune-modulatory role of {SCFAs} and their importance for cardiovascular health. The data suggest that lifestyle modifications leading to augmented {SCFA} production could be a beneficial nonpharmacological preventive strategy for patients with hypertensive cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {Dietary salt reduction and exercise are lifestyle modifications for salt-sensitive hypertensives. While exercise has prominent metabolic effects, salt has an adverse effect on metabolic syndrome, of which hypertension is a hallmark. We hypothesized that dietary salt impacts metabolism in a salt-sensitive model of hypertension. An untargeted metabolomic approach demonstrates lower circulating levels of the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (β{OHB}), in high salt-fed hypertensive rats. Despite the high salt intake, specific rescue of β{OHB} levels by nutritional supplementation of its precursor, 1,3-butanediol, attenuates hypertension and protects kidney function. This beneficial effect of β{OHB} was likely independent of gut-microbiotal and Th17-mediated effects of salt and instead facilitated by β{OHB} inhibiting the renal Nlrp3 inflammasome. The juxtaposed effects of dietary salt and exercise on salt-sensitive hypertension, which decrease and increase β{OHB} respectively, indicate that nutritional supplementation of a precursor of β{OHB} provides a similar benefit to salt-sensitive hypertension as exercise. Chakraborty et al. report a link between dietary salt, a ketone, and experimental hypertension. Intake of a high salt diet lowers the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (β{OHB}), produced by the liver, which functions to prevent Nlrp3-mediated kidney inflammation. Rescuing β{OHB} by nutritional supplementation of its precursor attenuates hypertension.},

Although increasing evidence implicates the gut microbiome in this variability, the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Here we show, by measuring the ability of 76 human gut bacteria from diverse clades to metabolize 271 orally administered drugs, that many drugs are chemically modified by microorganisms. We combined high-throughput genetic analyses with mass spectrometry to systematically identify microbial gene products that metabolize drugs. These microbiome-encoded enzymes can directly and substantially affect intestinal and systemic drug metabolism in mice, and can explain the drug-metabolizing activities of human gut bacteria and communities on the basis of their genomic contents. These causal links between the gene content and metabolic activities of the microbiota connect interpersonal variability in microbiomes to interpersonal differences in drug metabolism, which has implications for medical therapy and drug development across multiple disease indications. High-throughput genetic analyses combined with mass spectrometry reveal that the gene products of diverse human gut bacteria affect a wide range of oral drugs, as well as drug metabolism in mice.},

	abstract = {Glyceryl triacetate ({GTA}), a compound effective at increasing circulating and tissue levels of acetate was used to treat rats subjected to a continual 28 day intra-ventricular infusion of bacterial lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}). This model produces a neuroinflammatory injury characterized by global neuroglial activation and a decrease in choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity in the basal forebrain. During the {LPS} infusion, rats were given a daily treatment of either water or {GTA} at a dose of 6 g/kg by oral gavage. In parallel experiments, free-{CoA} and acetyl-{CoA} levels were measured in microwave fixed brains and flash frozen heart, liver, kidney and muscle following a single oral dose of {GTA}. We found that a single oral dose of {GTA} significantly increased plasma acetate levels by 15 min and remained elevated for up to 4 h. At 30 min the acetyl-{CoA} levels in microwave-fixed brain and flash frozen heart and liver were increased at least 2.2-fold. The concentrations of brain acetyl-{CoA} was significantly increased between 30 and 45 min following treatment and remained elevated for up to 4 h. The concentration of free-{CoA} in brain was significantly decreased compared to controls at 240 min. Immunohistochemical and morphological analysis demonstrated that a daily treatment with {GTA} significantly reduced the percentage of reactive glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes and activated {CD}11b-positive microglia by 40-50\% in rats subjected to {LPS}-induced neuroinflammation. Further, in rats subjected to neuroinflammation, {GTA} significantly increased the number of choline acetyltransferase ({ChAT})-positive cells by 40\% in the basal forebrain compared to untreated controls. These data suggest that acetate supplementation increases intermediary short chain acetyl-{CoA} metabolism and that treatment is potentially anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective with regards to attenuating neuroglial activation and increasing {ChAT} immunoreactivity in this model. © 2011 The Authors Journal of Neurochemistry © 2011 International Society for Neurochemistry.},

	abstract = {Long-term acetate supplementation reduces neuroglial activation and cholinergic cell loss in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation. Additionally, a single dose of glyceryl triacetate, used to induce acetate supplementation, increases histone H3 and H4 acetylation and inhibits histone deacetylase activity and histone deacetylase-2 expression in normal rat brain. Here, we propose that the therapeutic effect of acetate in reducing neuroglial activation is due to a reversal of lipopolysaccharide-induced changes in histone acetylation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. In this study, we examined the effect of a 28-day-dosing regimen of glyceryl triacetate, to induce acetate supplementation, on brain histone acetylation and interleukin-1β expression in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation. The effect was analyzed using Western blot analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzymic histone deacetylase and histone acetyltransferase assays. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance, parametric or nonparametric when appropriate, followed by Tukey's or Dunn's post-hoc test, respectively. We found that long-term acetate supplementation increased the proportion of brain histone H3 acetylated at lysine 9 (H3K9), histone H4 acetylated at lysine 8 and histone H4 acetylated at lysine 16. However, unlike a single dose of glyceryl triacetate, long-term treatment increased histone acetyltransferase activity and had no effect on histone deacetylase activity, with variable effects on brain histone deacetylase class I and {II} expression. In agreement with this hypothesis, neuroinflammation reduced the proportion of brain H3K9 acetylation by 50\%, which was effectively reversed with acetate supplementation. Further, in rats subjected to lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β protein and {mRNA} levels were increased by 1.3- and 10-fold, respectively, and acetate supplementation reduced this expression to control levels. Based on these results, we conclude that dietary acetate supplementation attenuates neuroglial activation by effectively reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by a mechanism that may involve a distinct site-specific pattern of histone acetylation and histone deacetylase expression in the brain.},

In parallel experiments, we measured the effect that acetate supplementation had on histone deacetylase ({HDAC}) and histone acetyltransferase ({HAT}) enzymic activities and the expression levels of {HDAC} class I and {II} enzymes using Western blot analysis.

No changes in other forms of brain or liver H3 and H4 acetylation-state were found at any post-treatment times measured. Enzymic {HAT} and {HDAC} assays on brain extracts showed that acetate supplementation had no effect on {HAT} activity, but significantly inhibited by 2-fold {HDAC} activity at 2 and 4 h post-treatment.

In this review, we will consider recent studies linking {SCFAs} to blood pressure regulation. Recent Findings: Several recent studies have found that changes in blood pressure often coordinate with expected changes in {SCFAS}. Efforts are now well underway to dissect and better understand this potential connection. One way that {SCFAs} can influence host cells is by interacting with host {GPCRs}, including Gpr41 and Olfr78, among others. Intriguingly, mice null for Olfr78 are hypotensive, whereas mice null for Gpr41 are hypertensive, implying that these pathways may be physiologically important links between {SCFAs} and host blood pressure control. Summary: In sum, these studies demonstrate that there does indeed appear to be a link between {SCFAs} and blood pressure, which likely involves host {GPCRs}, at least in part; however, the details and intricacies of these interactions are not yet fully understood and will greatly benefit from further studies.},

	abstract = {Short chain fatty acid ({SCFA}) metabolites are byproducts of gut microbial metabolism that are known to affect host physiology via host G proteincoupled receptor ({GPCRs}). We previously showed that an acute {SCFA} bolus decreases blood pressure ({BP}) in anesthetized mice, an effect mediated primarily via Gpr41. In this study, our aims were to identify the cellular localization of Gpr41 and to determine its role in {BP} regulation. We localized Gpr41 to the vascular endothelium using {RT}-{PCR}: Gpr41 is detected in intact vessels (with endothelium) but is absent from denuded vessels (without endothelium). Furthermore, using pressure myography we confirmed that {SCFAs} dilate resistance vessels in an endothelium-dependent manner. Since we previously found that Gpr41 mediates a hypotensive response to acute {SCFA} administration, we hypothesized that Gpr41 knockout ({KO}) mice would be hypertensive. Here, we report that Gpr41 {KO} mice have isolated systolic hypertension compared with wild-type ({WT}) mice; diastolic {BP} was not different between {WT} and {KO}. Older Gpr41 {KO} mice also exhibited elevated pulse wave velocity, consistent with a phenotype of systolic hypertension; however, there was no increase in ex vivo aorta stiffness (measured by mechanical tensile testing). Plasma renin concentrations were also similar in {KO} and {WT} mice. The systolic hypertension in Gpr41 {KO} is not salt sensitive, as it is not significantly altered on either a high- or low-salt diet. In sum, these studies suggest that endothelial Gpr41 lowers baseline {BP}, likely by decreasing active vascular tone without altering passive characteristics of the blood vessels, and that Gpr41 {KO} mice have hypertension of a vascular origin.},

In addition, both Olfr78 and G protein-coupled receptor 41 (Gpr41), another {SCFA} receptor, are expressed in smooth muscle cells of small resistance vessels. Propionate, a {SCFA} shown to induce vasodilation ex vivo, produces an acute hypotensive response in wild-type mice. This effect is differentially modulated by disruption of Olfr78 and Gpr41 expression. {SCFAs} are end products of fermentation by the gut microbiota and are absorbed into the circulation.

However, little is known of the source of endogenous ligands, signaling pathways, or effectors in sympathetic neurons. In this study, we found that {FFA}3 and {FFA}2 are unevenly expressed in the rat {SNS} with higher transcript levels in prevertebral (e.g., celiac-superior mesenteric and major pelvic) versus paravertebral (e.g., superior cervical and stellate) ganglia. {FFA}3, whether heterologously or natively expressed, coupled via {PTX}-sensitive G-proteins to produce voltage-dependent inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels (Cav2.2) in sympathetic neurons. In addition to acetate and propionate, we show that β-hydroxybutyrate ({BHB}), a metabolite produced during ketogenic conditions, is also an {FFA}3 agonist. This contrasts with previous interpretations of {BHB} as an antagonist at {FFA}3. Together, these results indicate that endogenous {BHB} levels, especially when elevated under certain conditions, such as starvation, diabetic ketoacidosis, and ketogenic diets, play a potentially important role in regulating the activity of the {SNS} through {FFA}3.

High salt may additionally drive autoimmunity by inducing T helper 17 (T(H)17) cells, which can also contribute to hypertension. Induction of T(H)17 cells depends on gut microbiota; however, the effect of salt on the gut microbiome is unknown. Here we show that high salt intake affects the gut microbiome in mice, particularly by depleting Lactobacillus murinus. Consequently, treatment of mice with L. murinus prevented salt-induced aggravation of actively induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and salt-sensitive hypertension by modulating T(H)17 cells. In line with these findings, a moderate high-salt challenge in a pilot study in humans reduced intestinal survival of Lactobacillus spp., increased T(H)17 cells and increased blood pressure. Our results connect high salt intake to the gut-immune axis and highlight the gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target to counteract salt-sensitive conditions.},

	abstract = {Many probiotics that affect gut microbial ecology have been shown to produce beneficial effects on renin-angiotensin-dependent rodent models and human hypertension. We hypothesized that Bifidobacterium breve {CECT}7263 ({BFM}) would attenuate hypertension in deoxycorticosterone acetate ({DOCA})-salt rats, a renin-independent model of hypertension. Rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, {DOCA}-salt, treated {DOCA}-salt-{BFM}, treated {DOCA}-salt-butyrate, and treated {DOCA}-salt-acetate, for 5 weeks. {BFM} prevented the increase in systolic blood pressure, cardiac weight, and renal damage induced by {DOCA}-salt. {BFM} increased acetate-producing bacterial population and gut acetate levels, improved colonic integrity, normalized endotoxemia, plasma trimethylamine ({TMA}) levels, and restored the Th17 and Treg content in mesenteric lymph nodes and aorta. Furthermore, {BFM} improved nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation induced by acetylcholine in aortic rings and reduced {NADPH} oxidase activity in {DOCA}-salt animals. These protective effects were mimicked by acetate, but not by butyrate supplementation. These data demonstrate that {BFM} induces changes in gut microbiota linked with attenuation of endothelial dysfunction and increase in blood pressure in this low-renin form of hypertension. These beneficial effects seem to be mediated by increased acetate and reduced {TMA} production by gut microbiota, thus, improving gut integrity and restoring Th17/Tregs polarization and endotoxemia.},

This study was designed to evaluate whether gut microbial composition affects hypertension. 16S {rRNA} genes obtained from cecal samples of Dahl salt-sensitive (S) and Dahl salt-resistant (R) rats were sequenced. Bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes were higher in the S rats compared with the R rats. Furthermore, the family S24-7 of the phylum Bacteroidetes and the family Veillonellaceae of the phylum Firmicutes were higher in the S rats compared with the R rats. Analyses of the various phylogenetic groups of cecal microbiota revealed significant differences between S and R rats. Both strains were maintained on a high-salt diet, administered antibiotics for ablation of microbiota, transplanted with S or R rat cecal contents, and monitored for blood pressure ({BP}). Systolic {BP} of the R rats remained unaltered irrespective of S or R rat cecal transplantation. Surprisingly, compared with the S rats given S rat cecal content, systolic {BP} of the S rats given a single bolus of cecal content from R rats was consistently and significantly elevated during the rest of their life, and they had a shorter lifespan. A lower level of fecal bacteria of the family Veillonellaceae and increased plasma acetate and heptanoate were features associated with the increased {BP} observed in the S rats given R rat microbiota compared with the S rats given S rat microbiota. These data demonstrate a link between microbial content and {BP} regulation and, because the S and R rats differ in their genomic composition, provide the necessary basis to further examine the relationship between the host genome and microbiome in the context of {BP} regulation in the Dahl rats.},

Our study investigated how high salt ({HS}) intake triggers early renal injury by considering the ‘gut-kidney axis’. We fed mice 2\% {NaCl} in drinking water continuously for 8 weeks to induce early renal injury. We found that the ‘quantitative’ and ‘qualitative’ levels of the intestinal microflora were significantly altered after chronic {HS} feeding, which indicated the occurrence of enteric dysbiosis. In addition, intestinal immunological gene expression was impaired in mice with {HS} intake. Gut permeability elevation and enteric bacterial translocation into the kidney were detected after chronic {HS} feeding. Gut bacteria depletion by non-absorbable antibiotic administration restored {HS} loading-induced gut leakiness, renal injury and systolic blood pressure elevation. The fecal microbiota from mice fed chronic {HS} could independently cause gut leakiness and renal injury. Our current work provides a novel insight into the mechanism of {HS}-induced renal injury by investigating the role of the intestine with enteric bacteria and gut permeability and clearly illustrates that chronic {HS} loading elicited renal injury and dysfunction that was dependent on the intestine.},

We tested the hypothesis that hypertension could be induced in a normotensive strain of rats or attenuated in a hypertensive strain of rats by exchanging the gut microbiota between the two strains. Cecal contents from spontaneously hypertensive stroke prone rats ({SHRSP}) were pooled. Similarly, cecal contents from normotensive {WKY} rats were pooled. Four-week-old recipient {WKY} and {SHR} rats, previously treated with antibiotics to reduce the native microbiota, were gavaged with {WKY} or {SHRSP} microbiota, resulting in four groups; {WKY} with {WKY} microbiota ({WKY} g-{WKY}), {WKY} with {SHRSP} microbiota ({WKY} g-{SHRSP}), {SHR} with {SHRSP} microbiota ({SHR} g-{SHRSP}), and {SHR} with {WKY} microbiota ({SHR} g-{WKY}). Systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) was measured weekly using tail-cuff plethysmography. At 11.5 wk of age systolic blood pressure increased 26 {mmHg} in {WKY} g-{SHRSP} compared with that in {WKY} g-{WKY} (182 ± 8 vs. 156 ± 8 {mmHg}, P = 0.02). Although the {SBP} in {SHR} g-{WKY} tended to decrease compared with {SHR} g-{SHRSP}, the differences were not statistically significant. Fecal pellets were collected at 11.5 wk of age for identification of the microbiota by sequencing the 16S ribosomal {RNA} gene. We observed a significant increase in the Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes ratio in the hypertensive {WKY} g-{SHRSP}, as compared with the normotensive {WKY} g-{WKY} (P = 0.042). Relative abundance of multiple taxa correlated with {SBP}. We conclude that gut dysbiosis can directly affect {SBP}.

First published December 23, 2019; doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00087.2019.—Fecal matter transfer from hypertensive patients and animals into normotensive animals increases blood pressure, strengthening the evidence for gut-microbiota interactions in the control of blood pressure. However, cellular and molecular events involved in gut dysbiosis-associated hypertension remain poorly understood. Therefore, our objective in this study was to use gene expression profiling to characterize the gut epithelium layer in the colon in hypertension. We observed significant suppression of components of T cell receptor ({TCR}) signaling in the colonic epithelium of spontaneously hypertensive rats ({SHR}) when compared with Wistar Kyoto ({WKY}) normotensive rats. Western blot analysis confirmed lower expression of key proteins including T cell surface glycoprotein {CD}3 gamma chain (Cd3g) and lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 (Lcp2). Furthermore, lower expression of cytokines and receptors responsible for lymphocyte proliferation, differentiation, and activation (e.g., Il12r, Il15ra, Il7, Il16, Tgfb1) was observed in the colonic epithelium of the {SHR}. Finally, Alpi and its product, intestinal alkaline phosphatase, primarily localized in the epithelial cells, were profoundly lower in the {SHR}. These observations demonstrate that the colonic epithelium undergoes functional changes linked to altered immune, barrier function, and dysbiosis in hypertension.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Human gut microbiota is believed to be directly or indirectly involved in cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. However, the identification and functional status of the hypertension-related gut microbe(s) have not yet been surveyed in a comprehensive manner. Methods: Here we characterized the gut microbiome in hypertension status by comparing fecal samples of 60 patients with primary hypertension and 60 gender-, age-, and body weight-matched healthy controls based on whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing. Results: Hypertension implicated a remarkable gut dysbiosis with significant reduction in within-sample diversity and shift in microbial composition. Metagenome-wide association study ({MGWAS}) revealed 53,953 microbial genes that differ in distribution between the patients and healthy controls (false discovery rate, 0.05) and can be grouped into 68 clusters representing bacterial species. Opportunistic pathogenic taxa, such as Klebsiella spp., Streptococcus spp. and Parabacteroides merdae were frequently distributed in hypertensive gut microbiome, whereas the short-chain fatty acid producer, such as Roseburia spp. and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, were higher in controls. The number of hypertension-associated species also showed stronger correlation to the severity of disease. Functionally, the hypertensive gut microbiome exhibited higher membrane transport, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and steroid degradation, while in controls the metabolism of amino acid, cofactors and vitamins was found to be higher. We further provided the microbial markers for disease discrimination and achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve ({AUC}) of 0.78, demonstrating the potential of gut microbiota in prediction of hypertension. Conclusion: These findings represent specific alterations in microbial diversity, genes, species and functions of the hypertensive gut microbiome. Further studies on the causality relationship between hypertension and gut microbiota will offer new prospects for treating and preventing the hypertension and its associated diseases.},

	abstract = {Background: Although transplantation of the fecal microbiota has been shown to have an antihypertensive effect in hypertensive animal models, its effect on blood pressure in patients with hypertension is unclear. This study aimed to assess the effect of washed microbiota transplantation ({WMT}) on blood pressure regulation in hypertensive patients. Methods: The clinical data of consecutive patients treated with washed microbiota transplantation ({WMT}) were collected retrospectively. The blood pressures of hypertensive patients before and after {WMT} were compared. The factors influencing the antihypertensive effect of {WMT} in hypertensive patients and fecal microbial composition of donors and hypertensive patients were also analyzed. Results: {WMT} exhibited an antihypertensive effect on blood pressure: the blood pressure at hospital discharge was significantly lower than that at hospital admission (change in systolic blood pressure: −5.09±15.51, P = 0.009; change in diastolic blood pressure: −7.74±10.42, P {\textless} 0.001). Hypertensive patients who underwent {WMT} via the lower gastrointestinal tract (β = −8.308, standard error = 3.856, P = 0.036) and those not taking antihypertensive drugs (β = −8.969, standard error = 4.256, P = 0.040) had a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure, and hypertensive patients not taking antihypertensive drugs also had a greater decrease in diastolic blood pressure (β = −8.637, standard error = 2.861, P = 0.004). After {WMT}, the Shannon Diversity Index was higher in six of eight hypertensive patients and the microbial composition of post-{WMT} samples tended to be closer to that of donor samples. Conclusion: {WMT} had a blood pressure-lowering effect in hypertensive patients, especially in those who underwent {WMT} via the lower gastrointestinal tract and in those not taking antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, modulation of the gut microbiota by {WMT} may offer an interesting and novel approach for hypertension treatment.},

	abstract = {Recently, the potential role of gut microbiome in metabolic diseases has been revealed, especially in cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases worldwide, yet whether gut microbiota dysbiosis participates in the development of hypertension remains largely unknown. To investigate this issue, we carried out comprehensive metagenomic and metabolomic analyses in a cohort of 41 healthy controls, 56 subjects with pre-hypertension, 99 individuals with primary hypertension, and performed fecal microbiota transplantation from patients to germ-free mice. Compared to the healthy controls, we found dramatically decreased microbial richness and diversity, Prevotella-dominated gut enterotype, distinct metagenomic composition with reduced bacteria associated with healthy status and overgrowth of bacteria such as Prevotella and Klebsiella, and disease-linked microbial function in both pre-hypertensive and hypertensive populations. Unexpectedly, the microbiome characteristic in pre-hypertension group was quite similar to that in hypertension. The metabolism changes of host with pre-hypertension or hypertension were identified to be closely linked to gut microbiome dysbiosis. And a disease classifier based on microbiota and metabolites was constructed to discriminate pre-hypertensive and hypertensive individuals from controls accurately. Furthermore, by fecal transplantation from hypertensive human donors to germ-free mice, elevated blood pressure was observed to be transferrable through microbiota, and the direct influence of gut microbiota on blood pressure of the host was demonstrated. Overall, our results describe a novel causal role of aberrant gut microbiota in contributing to the pathogenesis of hypertension. And the significance of early intervention for pre-hypertension was emphasized.},

	abstract = {Background: Computable phenotypes have the ability to utilize data within the electronic health record ({EHR}) to identify patients with certain characteristics. Many computable phenotypes rely on multiple types of data within the {EHR} including prescription drug information. Hypertension ({HTN})-related computable phenotypes are particularly dependent on the correct classification of antihypertensive prescription drug information, as well as corresponding diagnoses and blood pressure information. Objective: This study aimed to create an antihypertensive drug classification system to be utilized with {EHR}-based data as part of {HTN}-related computable phenotypes. Methods: We compared 4 different antihypertensive drug classification systems based off of 4 different methodologies and terminologies, including 3 {RxNorm} Concept Unique Identifier ({RxCUI})-based classifications and 1 medication name-based classification. The {RxCUI}-based classifications utilized data from (1) the Drug Ontology, (2) the new Medication Reference Terminology, and (3) the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System and {DrugBank}, whereas the medication name-based classification relied on antihypertensive drug names. Each classification system was applied to {EHR}-based prescription drug data from hypertensive patients in the {OneFlorida} Data Trust. Results: There were 13,627 unique {RxCUIs} and 8025 unique medication names from the 13,879,046 prescriptions. We observed a broad overlap between the 4 methods, with 84.1\% (691/822) to 95.3\% (695/729) of terms overlapping pairwise between the different classification methods. Key differences arose from drug products with multiple dosage forms, drug products with an indication of benign prostatic hyperplasia, drug products that contain more than 1 ingredient (combination products), and terms within the classification systems corresponding to retired or obsolete {RxCUIs}. Conclusions: In total, 2 antihypertensive drug classifications were constructed, one based on {RxCUIs} and one based on medication name, that can be used in future computable phenotypes that require antihypertensive drug classifications.},

	abstract = {Background: Equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate ({GFR}) are routinely used to assess kidney function. Current equations have limited precision and systematically underestimate measured {GFR} at higher values. Objective: To develop a new estimating equation for {GFR}: the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration ({CKD}-{EPI}) equation. Design: Cross-sectional analysis with separate pooled data sets for equation development and validation and a representative sample of the U.S. population for prevalence estimates. Setting: Research studies and clinical populations ("studies") with measured {GFR} and {NHANES} (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), 1999 to 2006. Participants: 8254 participants in 10 studies (equation development data set) and 3896 participants in 16 studies (validation data set). Prevalence estimates were based on 16 032 participants in {NHANES}. Measurements: {GFR}, measured as the clearance of exogenous filtration markers (iothalamate in the development data set; iothalamate and other markers in the validation data set), and linear regression to estimate the logarithm of measured {GFR} from standardized creatinine levels, sex, race, and age. Results: In the validation data set, the {CKD}-{EPI} equation performed better than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation, especially at higher {GFR} (P {\textless} 0.001 for all subsequent comparisons), with less bias (median difference between measured and estimated {GFR}, 2.5 vs. 5.5 {mL}/min per 1.73 m2), improved precision (interquartile range [{IQR}] of the differences, 16.6 vs. 18.3 {mL}/min per 1.73 m2), and greater accuracy (percentage of estimated {GFR} within 30\% of measured {GFR}, 84.1\% vs. 80.6\%). In {NHANES}, the median estimated {GFR} was 94.5 {mL}/min per 1.73 m2 ({IQR}, 79.7 to 108.1) vs. 85.0 ({IQR}, 72.9 to 98.5) {mL}/min per 1.73 m2, and the prevalence of chronic kidney disease was 11.5\% (95\% {CI}, 10.6\% to 12.4\%) versus 13.1\% ({CI}, 12.1\% to 14.0\%). Limitation: The sample contained a limited number of elderly people and racial and ethnic minorities with measured {GFR}. Conclusion: The {CKD}-{EPI} creatinine equation is more accurate than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation and could replace it for routine clinical use. © 2009 American College of Physicians.},

	abstract = {Summary Background Optimal drug treatment for patients with resistant hypertension is undefined. We aimed to test the hypotheses that resistant hypertension is most often caused by excessive sodium retention, and that spironolactone would therefore be superior to non-diuretic add-on drugs at lowering blood pressure. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we enrolled patients aged 18-79 years with seated clinic systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater (or ≥135 mm Hg for patients with diabetes) and home systolic blood pressure (18 readings over 4 days) 130 mm Hg or greater, despite treatment for at least 3 months with maximally tolerated doses of three drugs, from 12 secondary and two primary care sites in the {UK}. Patients rotated, in a preassigned, randomised order, through 12 weeks of once daily treatment with each of spironolactone (25-50 mg), bisoprolol (5-10 mg), doxazosin modified release (4-8 mg), and placebo, in addition to their baseline blood pressure drugs. Random assignment was done via a central computer system. Investigators and patients were masked to the identity of drugs, and to their sequence allocation. The dose was doubled after 6 weeks of each cycle. The hierarchical primary endpoints were the difference in averaged home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and placebo, followed (if significant) by the difference in home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and the average of the other two active drugs, followed by the difference in home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and each of the other two drugs. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with {EudraCT} number 2008-007149-30, and {ClinicalTrials}.gov number, {NCT}02369081. Findings Between May 15, 2009, and July 8, 2014, we screened 436 patients, of whom 335 were randomly assigned. After 21 were excluded, 285 patients received spironolactone, 282 doxazosin, 285 bisoprolol, and 274 placebo; 230 patients completed all treatment cycles. The average reduction in home systolic blood pressure by spironolactone was superior to placebo (-8·70 mm Hg [95\% {CI} -9·72 to -7·69]; p{\textless}0·0001), superior to the mean of the other two active treatments (doxazosin and bisoprolol; -4·26 [-5·13 to -3·38]; p{\textless}0·0001), and superior when compared with the individual treatments; versus doxazosin (-4·03 [-5·04 to -3·02]; p{\textless}0·0001) and versus bisoprolol (-4·48 [-5·50 to -3·46]; p{\textless}0·0001). Spironolactone was the most effective blood pressure-lowering treatment, throughout the distribution of baseline plasma renin; but its margin of superiority and likelihood of being the best drug for the individual patient were many-fold greater in the lower than higher ends of the distribution. All treatments were well tolerated. In six of the 285 patients who received spironolactone, serum potassium exceeded 6·0 mmol/L on one occasion. Interpretation Spironolactone was the most effective add-on drug for the treatment of resistant hypertension. The superiority of spironolactone supports a primary role of sodium retention in this condition. Funding The British Heart Foundation and National Institute for Health Research.},

	abstract = {Background: Alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity is incompletely understood. Specifically, the long-term impact of alcohol use on ventricular remodeling or dysfunction, its modulators, and effect thresholds among young adults remain controversial. Objectives: The authors sought to evaluate a potential relationship between alcohol intake and cardiac remodeling, assessed by echocardiography, over 20 years of follow-up. Methods: Among the {CARDIA} (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study cohort, the authors studied all subjects without baseline heart disorders who provided adequate information on their drinking habits and underwent echocardiographic evaluation at years 5 and 25 of the study. The echocardiographic outcomes were left ventricular ({LV}) ejection fraction, indexed {LV} end-diastolic volume and {LV} mass, and left atrial diameter. Participants were grouped according to their weighted-average weekly drinking habits. An additional analysis used the estimated cumulative alcohol consumption. Regression models and multivariable fractional polynomials were used to evaluate the association between alcohol consumption and the outcomes. Results: Among the 2,368 participants, alcohol consumption was an independent predictor of higher indexed {LV} mass (p = 0.014) and indexed {LV} end-diastolic volume (p = 0.037), regardless of sex. No significant relationship between alcohol intake and {LV} ejection fraction was found. Drinking predominantly wine was associated with less cardiac remodeling and there was a nonsignificant trend for a harmful effect of binge drinking. Conclusions: After 20 years of follow-up, alcohol intake was associated with adverse cardiac remodeling, although it was not related with {LV} systolic dysfunction in this initially healthy young cohort. Our results also suggest that drinking predominantly wine associates with less deleterious findings in cardiac structure.},

Methods and findings We measured abdominal muscle total, lean, and adipose volumes (in cubic centimeters) and attenuation (in Hounsfield units [{HU}]) along with subcutaneous ({SAT}) and visceral adipose tissue ({VAT}) volumes using computed tomography ({CT}) in 3,020 middle-aged Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ({CARDIA}) participants (age 42–58, 56.3\% women, 52.6\% white race) at the year 25 (Y25) visit. The longitudinal {CARDIA} study was initiated in 1985 with the recruitment of young adult participants (aged 18–30 years) equally balanced by female and male sex and black and white race at 4 field centers located in Birmingham, {AL}, Chicago, {IL}, Minneapolis, {MN}, and Oakland, {CA}. Multivariable linear models included potential confounders such as physical activity and dietary habits along with traditional {CVD} risk factors. Current smokers had lower {BMI} than never smokers. Nevertheless, in the fully adjusted multivariable model with potential confounders, including {BMI} and {CVD} risk factors, adjusted mean (95\% {CI}) {IMAT} volume was 2.66 (2.55–2.76) cm3 in current smokers (n = 524), 2.36 (2.29–2.43) cm3 in former smokers (n = 944), and 2.23 (2.18–2.29) cm3 in never smokers (n = 1,552) (p = 0.007 for comparison of former versus never smoker, and p {\textless} 0.001 for comparison of current smoker versus never and former smoker). Moreover, compared to participants who never smoked throughout life (41.6 [41.3–41.9] {HU}), current smokers (40.4 [39.9–40.9] {HU}) and former smokers (40.8 [40.5–41.2] {HU}) had lower lean muscle attenuation suggesting lower muscle quality in the fully adjusted model (p {\textless} 0.001 for comparison of never smokers with either of the other two strata). Among participants who had ever smoked, pack-years of smoking exposure were directly associated with {IMAT} volume (β [95\% {CI}]: 0.017 [0.010–0.025]) (p {\textless} 0.001). Despite having less {SAT}, current smokers also had higher {VAT}/{SAT} ratio than never smokers. These findings must be viewed with caution as residual confounding and/or reverse causation may contribute to these associations.   Conclusions We found that, compared to those who never smoked, current and former smokers had abdominal muscle composition that was higher in adipose tissue volume, a finding consistent with higher {CVD} risk and age-related physical deconditioning. These findings challenge the belief that smoking-associated weight loss or maintenance confers a health benefit.},

Objectives: This study examined trends in mid-arm circumference (mid-{AC}) and distribution of {BP} cuff sizes using 1999-2002, 2003-2006, and 2007-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES}) data. Methods: {NHANES} uses a complex multistage probability sample design to select participants who are representative of the entire civilian, noninstitutionalized {US} population. The analytic sample consisted of 28 233 participants aged 20 years or older. Mid-{AC} and {BP} cuff sizes were analyzed across survey years by sex, age, race/ethnicity, hypertension, and diabetic status. Results: Data from {NHANES} 2007-2010 show that the mean mid-{AC} for men was 34.2 cm and for women was 31.9 cm. Men showed a significant trend in mid-{AC} (from 33.9 cm in 1999-2002 to 34.2 cm in 2007-2010; P{\textless}0.05 for trend). In addition, 42.9\% of men and 25.3\% of women needed a large adult {BP} cuff and 1.9\% of men and 2.8\% of women needed thigh cuffs to be appropriately cuffed. Moreover, 52\% of hypertensive men, 38\% of hypertensive women, 59.1\% of diabetic men, and 53.6\% of diabetic women required the use of {BP} cuffs with sizes different from those of standard adult-sized {BP} cuffs for accurate {BP} measurement. Conclusion: There was an overall significant trend in the mean mid-{AC} in cm for men but not for women. On the basis of {NHANES} 2007-2010 data, ∼45\% of adult men and ∼28\% of adult women required the use of {BP} cuffs with sizes different from those of standard adult-sized {BP} cuffs for accurate {BP} measurement. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Microglia dynamically interact with neurons influencing the development, structure, and function of neuronal networks. Recent studies suggest microglia may also influence neuronal activity by physically interacting with axonal domains responsible for action potential initiation and propagation. However, the nature of these microglial process interactions is not well understood. Microglial-axonal contacts are present early in development and persist through adulthood, implicating microglial interactions in the regulation of axonal integrity in both the developing and mature central nervous system. Moreover, changes in microglial-axonal contact have been described in disease states such as multiple sclerosis ({MS}) and traumatic brain injury ({TBI}). Depending on the disease state, there are increased associations with specific axonal segments. In {MS}, there is enhanced contact with the axon initial segment and node of Ranvier, while, in {TBI}, microglia alter interactions with axons at the site of injury, as well as at the axon initial segment. In this article, we review the interactions of microglial processes with axonal segments, analyzing their associations with various axonal domains and how these interactions may differ between {MS} and {TBI}. Furthermore, we discuss potential functional consequences and molecular mechanisms of these interactions and how these may differ among various types of microglial-axonal interactions.},

	abstract = {Minocycline is a second-generation, semi-synthetic tetracycline that has been in therapeutic use for over 30 years because of its antibiotic properties against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It is mainly used in the treatment of acne vulgaris and some sexually transmitted diseases. Recently, it has been reported that tetracyclines can exert a variety of biological actions that are independent of their anti-microbial activity, including anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, and inhibition of proteolysis, angiogenesis and tumour metastasis. These findings specifically concern to minocycline as it has recently been found to have multiple non-antibiotic biological effects that are beneficial in experimental models of various diseases with an inflammatory basis, including dermatitis, periodontitis, atherosclerosis and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Of note, minocycline has also emerged as the most effective tetracycline derivative at providing neuroprotection. This effect has been confirmed in experimental models of ischaemia, traumatic brain injury and neuropathic pain, and of several neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. Moreover, other pre-clinical studies have shown its ability to inhibit malignant cell growth and activation and replication of human immunodeficiency virus, and to prevent bone resorption. Considering the above-mentioned findings, this review will cover the most important topics in the pharmacology of minocycline to date, supporting its evaluation as a new therapeutic approach for many of the diseases described herein. © 2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Hypertension contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We assessed the safety and efficacy of a central iliac arteriovenous anastomosis to alter the mechanical arterial properties and reduce blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Methods: We enrolled patients in this open-label, multicentre, prospective, randomised, controlled trial between October, 2012, and April, 2014. Eligible patients had baseline office systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher and average daytime ambulatory blood pressure of 135 mm Hg or higher systolic and 85 mm Hg or higher diastolic despite antihypertensive treatment. Patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to undergo implantation of an arteriovenous coupler device plus current pharmaceutical treatment or to maintain current treatment alone (control). The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in office and 24 h ambulatory systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Analysis was by modified intention to treat (all patients remaining in follow-up at 6 months). This trial is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}01642498. Findings: 83 (43\%) of 195 patients screened were assigned arteriovenous coupler therapy (n=44) or normal care (n=39). Mean office systolic blood pressure reduced by 26.9 ({SD} 23.9) mm Hg in the arteriovenous coupler group (p{\textless}0.0001) and by 3.7 (21.2) mm Hg in the control group (p=0.31). Mean systolic 24 h ambulatory blood pressure reduced by 13.5 (18.8) mm Hg (p{\textless}0.0001) in arteriovenous coupler recipients and by 0.5 (15.8) mm Hg (p=0.86) in controls. Implantation of the arteriovenous coupler was associated with late ipsilateral venous stenosis in 12 (29\%) of 42 patients and was treatable with venoplasty or stenting. Interpretation: Arteriovenous anastomosis was associated with significantly reduced blood pressure and hypertensive complications.

	doi = {10.1016/J.AHJ.2021.05.002},
	abstract = {Background: Hypertension ({HTN}) is frequently linked with depression ({DEP}) in adults with cardiovascular disease ({CVD}), yet the underlying mechanism and successful management remain elusive. We approached this knowledge gap through the lens that humans are eukaryote-prokaryote "meta-organisms," such that cardiovascular disease dysregulation is a mosaic disorder involving dysbiosis of the gut. We hypothesized that patients diagnosed with hypertension plus depression harbor a unique gut microbial ecology with attending functional genomics engaged with their hosts' gut/brain axis physiology. Methods: Stool microbiome {DNA} was analyzed by whole metagenome shotgun sequencing in 54 subjects parsed into cohorts diagnosed with {HTN} only (N = 18), {DEP} only (N = 7), {DEP} plus {HTN} ({DEP}-{HTN}) (N = 8), or reference subjects with neither {HTN} nor {DEP} (N = 21). A novel battery of machine-learning multivariate analyses of de-noised data yielded effect sizes and permutational covariance-based dissimilarities that significantly differentiated the cohorts (false discovery rate ({FDR})-adjusted P ≤.05); data clustering within 95\% confidence interval). Results: Metagenomic significant differences extricated the four cohorts. Data of the cohort exhibiting {DEP}-{HTN} were germane to the interplay of central control of blood pressure concomitant with the neuropathology of depressive disorders. {DEP}-{HTN} gut bacterial community ecology was defined by co-occurrence of Eubacterium siraeum, Alistipes obesi, Holdemania filiformis, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 1.1.57FAA with Streptococcus salivariu. The corresponding microbial functional genomics of {DEP}-{HTN} engaged pathways degrading {GABA} and beneficial short chain fatty acids ({SCFA}), and are associated with enhanced sodium absorption and inflammasome induction. Conclusions: These data suggest a new putative endotype of hypertension, which we denote “depressive-hypertension” ({DEP}-{HTN}), for which we posit a model that is distinctive from either {HTN} alone or {DEP} alone. An "endotype" is a subtype of a heterogeneous pathophysiological mechanism. The {DEP}-{HTN} model incorporates a unique signature of microbial taxa and functional genomics with crosstalk that putatively intertwines host pathophysiology involving the gastrointestinal tract with disruptions in central control of blood pressure and mood. The {DEP}-{HTN} endotype model engages cardiology with gastroenterology and psychiatry, providing a proof-of-concept foundation to explore future treatments, diagnosis, and prevention of {HTN}-coupled mood disorders.},

We divided the animals into four groups: {WKY} transplanted with {WKY} microbiota (W-W), {SHR} with {SHR} (S-S), {WKY} with {SHR} (W-S) and {SHR} with {WKY} (S-W). Basal systolic {BP} ({SBP}) and diastolic {BP} ({DBP}) were reduced with no change in heart rate in fecal microbiota transplantation ({FMT}) from {WKY} rats to {SHR}. Similarly, {FMT} from {SHR} to {WKY} increased basal {SBP} and {DBP}. Increases in both {NADPH} oxidase-driven reactive oxygen species production and proinflammatory cytokines in brain paraventricular nucleus linked to higher sympathetic drive, measured by {BP} drop with pentolinium and plasmatic noradrenaline ({NA}) levels, were found in the S-S group as compared to the W-W group, and were reduced in the S-W group. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced {mRNA} levels of gap junction proteins, associated with increased tyrosine hydroxylase {mRNA} levels and {NA} content in the proximal colon were found in the S-S group compared to the W-W group. These changes were inhibited in the S-W group. According to our correlation analyses, the abundance of Blautia and Odoribacter showed a negative correlation with high {SBP}.

In additional experiments, we used a design to determine whether blockade of B7-dependent costimulation with {CTLA}4-Ig or blockade of {IL}-17 with {IL}-17-neutralizing antibody could prevent hypertension caused by faecal microbiota transplantation ({FMT}) from {SHR} to {WKY}. Results: Correlation analyses identified the bacterial abundance of Turicibacter and S24-7\_g that, respectively, positively and negatively correlated with systolic {BP}. {FMT} from {WKY} rats to {SHR} rats reduced basal systolic {BP}, restored the imbalance between Th17/Treg in mesenteric lymph nodes ({MLNs}) and aorta, and improved endothelial dysfunction and vascular oxidative status found in {SHR} transplanted with {SHR} faeces. {FMT} from {SHR} to {WKY} increased {CD}80 and {CD}86 {mRNA} levels and T cells activation in {MLNs}, circulating T cells, aortic T cell infiltration, impaired endothelial function and increased basal {SBP}. These effects were abolished by blockade of B7-dependent costimulation with {CTLA}4-Ig. {IL}-17a neutralizing antibody reduced {SBP} and improved endothelial dysfunction induced by {FMT} from {SHR} to {WKY}. Conclusion: Gut microbiota is an important factor involved in the control of {BP}, as a consequence of its effect in T-cell activation in gut immune system and vascular T-cells accumulation.},

	title = {Projections of Cardiovascular Disease Prevalence and Costs: 2015-2035: Technical Report},
	abstract = {This study was undertaken to project the prevalence and medical costs of hypertension, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure ({CHF}), stroke, atrial fibrillation, and all other {CVDs} from 2015 to 2035. We used a methodology that avoided double counting of costs for patients with multiple cardiovascular conditions. The projections illustrate what is likely to happen to {CVD} prevalence and costs if no change to current policy is made and no further action is taken to reduce the disease and economic burden of {CVD}. These projections provide a useful baseline against which to gauge the success of current and future {CVD} policy. In 2015, 41.5\% of the U.S. population (more than 100 million people) was projected to have some form of {CVD}. By 2035, {CVD} prevalence is expected to increase to 45.1\% (more than 130 million people). This represents a 30\% increase in the number of people with {CVD} over the next 20 years. Counts of people with coronary heart disease, {CHF}, stroke, and atrial fibrillation are expected to increase by more than 40\% each between 2015 and 2035. Between 2015 and 2035, real total direct medical costs of {CVD} are projected to more than double from \$318 billion to \$749 billion. Real indirect costs (due to lost productivity) for all {CVDs} are estimated to increase from \$237 billion in 2015 to \$368 billion in 2035 (55\% increase). Total (medical and indirect) costs of {CVD} are expected to double from \$555 billion in 2015 to \$1.1 trillion in 2035. Across all conditions, relative increases in costs are expected to be the highest (more than triple) among persons aged 80 or older and Hispanics. These findings indicate that {CVD} prevalence and costs are projected to increase substantially. Effective research, prevention, and treatment strategies are needed to limit the growing burden of {CVD}.},

	abstract = {Background: Fields like nonlinear physics offer methods for analyzing time series, but many methods require that the time series be stationary-no change in properties over time. Objective Medicine is far from stationary, but the challenge may be able to be ameliorated by reparameterizing time because clinicians tend to measure patients more frequently when they are ill and are more likely to vary. Methods: We compared time parameterizations, measuring variability of rate of change and magnitude of change, and looking for homogeneity of bins of temporal separation between pairs of time points. We studied four common laboratory tests drawn from 25 years of electronic health records on 4 million patients. Results: We found that sequence time-that is, simply counting the number of measurements from some start-produced more stationary time series, better explained the variation in values, and had more homogeneous bins than either traditional clock time or a recently proposed intermediate parameterization. Sequence time produced more accurate predictions in a single Gaussian process model experiment. Conclusions: Of the three parameterizations, sequence time appeared to produce the most stationary series, possibly because clinicians adjust their sampling to the acuity of the patient. Parameterizing by sequence time may be applicable to association and clustering experiments on electronic health record data. A limitation of this study is that laboratory data were derived from only one institution. Sequence time appears to be an important potential parameterization.},

Inpatient care fragmentation (admission to multiple different hospitals) in this population has not been well described. To determine the prevalence of super-utilizers who receive fragmented care across different hospitals and to describe associated risks, costs, and health outcomes. We analyzed inpatient data from the Health Care Utilization Project’s State Inpatient and Emergency Department database from 6 states from 2013. After identifying hospital super-utilizers, we stratified by the number of different hospitals visited in a 1-year period. We determined how patient demographics, costs, and outcomes varied by degree of fragmentation. We then examined how fragmentation would influence a hospital’s ability to identify super-utilizers. Adult patients with 4 or more inpatient stays in 1 year. Patient demographics, cost, 1-year hospital reported mortality, and probability that a single hospital could correctly identify a patient as a super-utilizer. Of the 167,515 hospital super-utilizers, 97,404 (58.1\%) visited more than 1 hospital in a 1-year period. Fragmentation was more likely among younger, non-white, low-income, under-insured patients, in population-dense areas. Patients with fragmentation were more likely to be admitted for chronic disease management, psychiatric illness, and substance abuse. Inpatient fragmentation was associated with higher yearly costs and lower likelihood of being identified as a super-utilizer. Inpatient care fragmentation is common among super-utilizers, disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. It is associated with high yearly costs and a decreased probability of correctly identifying super-utilizers.},

Validity checks included the evaluation of expected power, covariate balance, and two control outcomes for which we expected a positive association and a null finding. We registered the protocol ({NCT}03648424, {ClinicalTrials}.gov) before evaluating the composite cardiovascular outcome based on {CAROLINA}’s primary end point. Hazard ratios ({HR}) and 95\% {CIs} were estimated in each data source and pooled with a fixed-effects meta-analysis. {RESULTS} We identified 24,131 {PSM} pairs of linagliptin and glimepiride initiators with sufficient power for noninferiority ({\textgreater}98\%). Exposure groups achieved excellent covariate balance, including key laboratory results, and expected associations between glimepiride and hypoglycemia ({HR} 2.38 [95\% {CI} 1.79–3.13]) and between linagliptin and end-stage renal disease ({HR} 1.08 [0.66–1.79]) were replicated. Linagliptin was associated with a 9\% decreased risk in the composite cardiovascular outcome with a {CI} including the null ({HR} 0.91 [0.79–1.05]), in line with noninferiority. {CONCLUSIONS} In a nonrandomized {RWD} study, we found that linagliptin has noninferior risk of a composite cardiovascular outcome compared with glimepiride.},

	abstract = {Importance: Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. In placebo-controlled cardiovascular safety trials, the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin demonstrated noninferiority, but it has not been tested against an active comparator. Objective: This trial assessed cardiovascular outcomes of linagliptin vs glimepiride (sulfonylurea) in patients with relatively early type 2 diabetes and risk factors for or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, noninferiority trial, with participant screening from November 2010 to December 2012, conducted at 607 hospital and primary care sites in 43 countries involving 6042 participants. Adults with type 2 diabetes, glycated hemoglobin of 6.5\% to 8.5\%, and elevated cardiovascular risk were eligible for inclusion. Elevated cardiovascular risk was defined as documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, aged at least 70 years, and evidence of microvascular complications. Follow-up ended in August 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive 5 mg of linagliptin once daily (n = 3023) or 1 to 4 mg of glimepiride once daily (n = 3010) in addition to usual care. Investigators were encouraged to intensify glycemic treatment, primarily by adding or adjusting metformin, α-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, or insulin, according to clinical need. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke with the aim to establish noninferiority of linagliptin vs glimepiride, defined by the upper limit of the 2-sided 95.47\% {CI} for the hazard ratio ({HR}) of linagliptin relative to glimepiride of less than 1.3. Results: Of 6042 participants randomized, 6033 (mean age, 64.0 years; 2414 [39.9\%] women; mean glycated hemoglobin, 7.2\%; median duration of diabetes, 6.3 years; 42\% with macrovascular disease; 59\% had undergone metformin monotherapy) were treated and analyzed. The median duration of follow-up was 6.3 years. The primary outcome occurred in 356 of 3023 participants (11.8\%) in the linagliptin group and 362 of 3010 (12.0\%) in the glimepiride group ({HR}, 0.98 [95.47\% {CI}, 0.84-1.14]; P {\textless}.001 for noninferiority), meeting the noninferiority criterion but not superiority (P =.76). Adverse events occurred in 2822 participants (93.4\%) in the linagliptin group and 2856 (94.9\%) in the glimepiride group, with 15 participants (0.5\%) in the linagliptin group vs 16 (0.5\%) in the glimepiride group with adjudicated-confirmed acute pancreatitis. At least 1 episode of hypoglycemic adverse events occurred in 320 (10.6\%) participants in the linagliptin group and 1132 (37.7\%) in the glimepiride group ({HR}, 0.23 [95\% {CI}, 0.21-0.26]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults with relatively early type 2 diabetes and elevated cardiovascular risk, the use of linagliptin compared with glimepiride over a median 6.3 years resulted in a noninferior risk of a composite cardiovascular outcome.

Predefined hierarchical testing of secondary end points showed significant differences in the rates of other composite end points, as well as myocardial infarction alone (5.8\% in the ticagrelor group vs. 6.9\% in the clopidogrel group, P=0.005) and death from vascular causes (4.0\% vs. 5.1\%, P=0.001) but not stroke alone (1.5\% vs. 1.3\%, P=0.22). The rate of death from any cause was also reduced with ticagrelor (4.5\%, vs. 5.9\% with clopidogrel; P{\textless}0.001). No significant difference in the rates of major bleeding was found between the ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups (11.6\% and 11.2\%, respectively; P=0.43), but ticagrelor was associated with a higher rate of major bleeding not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting (4.5\% vs. 3.8\%, P=0.03), including more instances of fatal intracranial bleeding and fewer of fatal bleeding of other types. {CONCLUSIONS} In patients who have an acute coronary syndrome with or without {ST}-segment elevation, treatment with ticagrelor as compared with clopidogrel significantly reduced the rate of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke without an increase in the rate of overall major bleeding but with an increase in the rate of non-procedure-related bleeding.

When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment - the target experiment or target trial - that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.},

	abstract = {The analysis of longitudinal healthcare data outside of highly controlled parallel-group randomized trials, termed real-world evidence ({RWE}), has received increasing attention in the medical literature. In this paper, we discuss the potential role of {RWE} in drug regulation with a focus on the analysis of healthcare databases. We present several cases in which {RWE} is already used and cases in which {RWE} could potentially support regulatory decision making. We summarize key issues that investigators and regulators should consider when designing or evaluating such studies, and we propose a structured process for implementing analyses that facilitates regulatory review. We evaluate the empirical evidence base supporting the validity, transparency, and reproducibility of {RWE} from analysis of healthcare databases and discuss the work that still needs to be done to ensure that such analyses can provide decision-ready evidence on the effectiveness and safety of treatments.},

We propose an initiative using healthcare claims data to assess the ability of nonrandomized {RWE} to provide results that are comparable with those from randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}). We selected 40 {RCTs}, and we estimate that approximately 30 attempted replications will be completed after feasibility analyses.

This initiative is the first to systematically evaluate the ability of nonrandomized {RWE} to replicate multiple {RCTs} using a structured process.

	abstract = {Problem/Condition: Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. In 2015, heart disease accounted for approximately 630,000 deaths, representing one in four deaths in the United States. Although heart disease death rates decreased 68\% for the total population from 1968 to 2015, marked disparities in decreases exist by race and state. Period Covered: 1968-2015. Description of System: The National Vital Statistics System ({NVSS}) data on deaths in the United States were abstracted for heart disease using diagnosis codes from the eighth, ninth, and tenth revisions of the International Classification of Diseases ({ICD}-8, {ICD}-9, and {ICD}-10) for 1968-2015. Population estimates were obtained from {NVSS} files. National and state-specific heart disease death rates for the total population and by race for adults aged ≥35 years were calculated for 1968-2015. National and state-specific black-white heart disease mortality ratios also were calculated. Death rates were age standardized to the 2000 U.S. standard population. Joinpoint regression was used to perform time trend analyses. Results: From 1968 to 2015, heart disease death rates decreased for the total U.S. population among adults aged ≥35 years, from 1,034.5 to 327.2 per 100,000 population, respectively, with variations in the magnitude of decreases by race and state. Rates decreased for the total population an average of 2.4\% per year, with greater average decreases among whites (2.4\% per year) than blacks (2.2\% per year). At the national level, heart disease death rates for blacks and whites were similar at the start of the study period (1968) but began to diverge in the late 1970s, when rates for blacks plateaued while rates for whites continued to decrease. Heart disease death rates among blacks remained higher than among whites for the remainder of the study period. Nationwide, the black-white ratio of heart disease death rates increased from 1.04 in 1968 to 1.21 in 2015, with large increases occurring during the 1970s and 1980s followed by small but steady increases until approximately 2005. Since 2005, modest decreases have occurred in the black-white ratio of heart disease death rates at the national level. The majority of states had increases in black-white mortality ratios from 1968 to 2015. The number of states with black-white mortality ratios {\textgreater}1 increased from 16 (40\%) to 27 (67.5\%). Interpretation: Although heart disease death rates decreased both for blacks and whites from 1968 to 2015, substantial differences in decreases were found by race and state. At the national level and in most states, blacks experienced smaller decreases in heart disease death rates than whites for the majority of the period. Overall, the black-white disparity in heart disease death rates increased from 1968 to 2005, with a modest decrease from 2005 to 2015. Public Health Action: Since 1968, substantial increases have occurred in black-white disparities of heart disease death rates in the United States at the national level and in many states. These increases appear to be due to faster decreases in heart disease death rates for whites than blacks, particularly from the late 1970s until the mid-2000s. Despite modest decreases in black-white disparities at the national level since 2005, in 2015, heart disease death rates were 21\% higher among blacks than among whites. This study demonstrates the use of {NVSS} data to conduct surveillance of heart disease death rates by race and of black-white disparities in heart disease death rates. Continued surveillance of temporal trends in heart disease death rates by race can provide valuable information to policy makers and public health practitioners working to reduce heart disease death rates both for blacks and whites and disparities between blacks and whites.},

	abstract = {Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context. Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years ({DALYs}), and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors—the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of deaths and {DALYs} that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific {DALY} rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic Index ({SDI}). Findings Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25\%. Global exposure for several occupational risks, high body-mass index ({BMI}), and drug use increased by more than 25\% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57·8\% (95\% {CI} 56·6–58·8) of global deaths and 41·2\% (39·8–42·8) of {DALYs}. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to global {DALYs} among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211·8 million [192·7 million to 231·1 million] global {DALYs}), smoking (148·6 million [134·2 million to 163·1 million]), high fasting plasma glucose (143·1 million [125·1 million to 163·5 million]), high {BMI} (120·1 million [83·8 million to 158·4 million]), childhood undernutrition (113·3 million [103·9 million to 123·4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103·1 million [90·8 million to 115·1 million]), high total cholesterol (88·7 million [74·6 million to 105·7 million]), household air pollution (85·6 million [66·7 million to 106·1 million]), alcohol use (85·0 million [77·2 million to 93·0 million]), and diets high in sodium (83·0 million [49·3 million to 127·5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable {DALYs} declined for micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted {DALY} rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable {DALYs} from high {BMI}, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with {SDI}; low physical activity, high {BMI}, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with {SDI}. In 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high {BMI} and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable {DALYs} in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable {DALYs} in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Interpretation Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be invariant to {SDI}. Increasing risks, including high {BMI}, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable {DALYs}, even as exposure is declining. Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden. Funding Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

	abstract = {Objectives To assess the effectiveness of telemedicine video visits in the management of hypertensive patients at home during the first year of the {COVID}-19 pandemic. We also evaluated associated measures of patient satisfaction with these holistic visits. Patients and Methods A quantitative analysis was performed of all home video visits coded with a diagnosis of Essential Hypertension during the first 12 months of the {COVID}-19 pandemic (March, 2020 through February, 2021). A total of 10,634 patients with 16,194 hypertension visits were present in our national telemedicine practice database during this time period. Among this population, a total of 569 patients who had 1,785 hypertension visits met the criteria of having two or more blood pressure readings, with the last blood pressure reading occurring in the report period. We analyzed baseline characteristics and blood pressure trends of these 569 patients over the study period. Voluntarily submitted patient satisfaction ratings, which were systematically requested at the end of each visit, were also analyzed. Results The mean age of the patients in this study cohort of 569 patients was 43.9 years, and 48.3\% were women. Over 62\% of the patients had an initial systolic {BP} over140 mm Hg, and 25\% had an initial {SBP} of greater than 160 mm Hg. The average number of visits over the study period was 3.1 visits per patient. An average of 6.4 {BP} measurements per patient were available over the study period. Over the study period, 77\% of the patients experienced an improvement in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure, with mean reductions of -9.7 mm Hg and -6.8 mm Hg in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively. A total of 416 patients in the cohort started with a blood pressure above 140/90 mm Hg. For this subset of patients, 55.7\% achieved a {BP} of {\textless}=140/90 by the end of the study period, and the average reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were -17.9 mm Hg and -12.8 mm Hg respectively, which corresponded to improvements of 11.2\% and 12.4\% respectively. These improvements did not vary significantly when patients were stratified by age, sex, or geographic region of residence (rural versus urban/suburban). Voluntarily submitted patient surveys indicated a high degree of patient satisfaction, with a mean satisfaction score of 4.94 (5 point scale). Conclusion Clinician-patient relationships established in a video-first telemedicine model were broadly effective for addressing sub-optimally controlled hypertension. Patient satisfaction with these visits was very high.},

	abstract = {Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular risk factor for acute cardiovascular outcomes, including acute coronary disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure. Despite the fact that it represents the most prevalent risk factor in the general population, mostly in elderly individuals, its awareness is still relatively low, being about one third of patients living with undiagnosed hypertension and high risk of experiencing acute cardiovascular events. In addition, though recent improvement in pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic options, hypertension is largely uncontrolled, with about 35–40\% of treated hypertensive patients achieving the recommended therapeutic targets. Among different modern interventions proposed for improving blood pressure control in treated hypertensive patients, a systematic adoption of home {BP} monitoring has demonstrated to be one of the most effective. Indeed, it improves patients’ awareness of the disease and adherence to prescribed medications and allows tailoring and personalizing {BP} lowering therapies. Home {BP} monitoring is particularly suitable for telemedicine and mobile-health solutions. Indeed, in specific conditions, when face-to-face interactions between patients and physicians are not allowed or even suspended, as in case of {COVID}-19 pandemic, telemedicine may ensure effective management of hypertension, as well as other cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities. This review will summarize strengths and limitations of telemedicine in the clinical management of hypertension with a particular focus on the lessons learned during the {COVID}-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Black people have a disproportionately higher risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and postpartum complications than White people but historically lower rates of postpartum follow-up. Few studies have investigated telehealth in the postpartum population. {OBJECTIVE}: This study aimed to investigate whether rapid switch to telehealth with audio-based visits during the {COVID}-19 pandemic decreased racial disparities in postpartum hypertension follow-up adherence. {STUDY} {DESIGN}: This retrospective cohort study included all the patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy who delivered between December 2019 and June 2020 at an urban tertiary care center. A preexisting postpartum hypertension quality improvement initiative was in place at this institution. Follow-up adherence within 6 weeks postpartum and at the 6-week visit were compared before February 15, 2020 (pretelehealth period) and following March 14, 2020 (post-telehealth period), with a 1-month implementation or washout period. The blood pressures at these visits were compared between time periods as a secondary outcome. {RESULTS}: A total of 473 patients were included in this analysis, of whom 76.3\% were non-Hispanic Black. There were 215 and 258 patients in the pre- and post-telehealth cohorts, respectively. Among those who attended follow-up, the proportion of visits done over telehealth went from 0\% pretelehealth to 98.0\% post-telehealth. The proportion of postpartum hypertension follow-up attendance changed from 48.5\% to 76.3\% among non-Hispanic Black people (P{\textless}.0001) and from 73.1\% to 76.7\% among non-Hispanic White people (P=.76), leaving only a 0.4\% racial gap (P=.97). This resulted in an elimination of the racial disparities in the post-telehealth period. {CONCLUSION}: Transition to telehealth with audio-based visits at the onset of the {COVID}-19 pandemic improved attendance at postpartum hypertension visits among non-Hispanic Black people. This, therefore, led to significant decreases in the racial disparities in follow-up rates at our institution in the setting of an existing quality improvement initiative. Further research should focus on the intentional use of telehealth in improving maternal outcomes, especially among the non-Hispanic Black people.},

	abstract = {Background: Home telehealth ({HT}) programs enable communication and remote monitoring of patient health data between clinician visits, with the goal of improving chronic disease self-management and outcomes. The Veterans Health Administration ({VHA}) established one of the earliest {HT} programs in the country in 2003; however, little is known about how these services have been utilized and expanded over the last decade. Objective: To describe trends in use of {VHA}’s {HT} program from 2010 through 2017 and correlates of length of enrollment in {HT} services. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Participants: Patients enrolled in {HT} between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2017. Main Measures: We described the number and characteristics of patients enrolled in {HT}, including the chronic conditions managed. We also identified length of {HT} enrollment and examined patient and facility characteristics associated with longer enrollment. Key Results: The total number of patients enrolled in {HT} was 402,263. At time of enrollment, half were {\textgreater}65 years old, 91\% were male, and 59.3\% lived in urban residences. The most common conditions addressed by {HT} were hypertension (28.8\%), obesity (23.9\%), and diabetes (17.0\%). The median time to disenrollment in {HT} was 261 days (8.6 months) but varied by chronic condition. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, covariates associated with higher likelihood of staying enrolled were older age, male gender, non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity, lower neighborhood socioeconomic status, living in a more rural setting, and a greater burden of comorbidities per the Gagne index. Conclusions: Across 8 years, over 400,000 veterans engaged in {HT} services for chronic disease management and over half remained in the program for longer than 8 months. Our work provides a real-world evaluation of {HT} service expansion in the {VHA}. Additional studies are necessary to identify optimal enrollment duration and patients most likely to benefit from {HT} services.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Hypertension treatment and control prevent more cardiovascular events than management of other modifiable risk factors. Although the age-adjusted proportion of {US} adults with controlled blood pressure ({BP}) defined as \&amp;lt;140/90 mm Hg, improved from 31.8\% in 1999–2000 to 48.5\% in 2007–2008, it remained stable through 2013–2014 and declined to 43.7\% in 2017–2018. To address the rapid decline in hypertension control, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a virtual workshop with multidisciplinary national experts. Also, the group sought to identify opportunities to reverse the adverse trend and further improve hypertension control. The workshop immediately preceded the Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Control Hypertension, which recognized a stagnation in progress with hypertension control. The presentations and discussions included potential reasons for the decline and challenges in hypertension control, possible “big ideas,” and multisector approaches that could reverse the current trend while addressing knowledge gaps and research priorities. The broad set of “big ideas” was comprised of various activities that may improve hypertension control, including: interventions to engage patients, promotion of self-measured {BP} monitoring with clinical support, supporting team-based care, implementing telehealth, enhancing community–clinical linkages, advancing precision population health, developing tailored public health messaging, simplifying hypertension treatment, using process and outcomes quality metrics to foster accountability and efficiency, improving access to high-quality health care, addressing social determinants of health, supporting cardiovascular public health and research, and lowering financial barriers to hypertension control.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Patient engagement is defined as patients’ knowledge, skills, ability, and willingness to manage their healthcare within the context of interventions designed to promote positive patient behaviors. Telemedicine is a rapidly growing method of healthcare services delivery. Telemedicine interventions are mainly used to facilitate communication between the patient and provider, measure, record, and track blood pressure, and educate and train patients about managing their blood pressure. Findings from several studies indicate the evidence of patient engagement, adherence to the care plan, improvement in knowledge about blood pressure, and patient satisfaction with telemedicine interventions for blood pressure. Telemedicine interventions need to be customized depending on patient demographics and socioeconomic characteristics such as age and education level to ensure optimal patient engagement.},

	abstract = {Telemedicine has been widely used for long-term care and self-management in patients with chronic disease, but there is no consensus regarding the effect of telemedicine on chronic disease management. The aim of this study is to review and analyse the effect of telemedicine on the management of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis using a systematic review and meta-analysis. We performed a comprehensive literature search of the Web of Science, {PubMed}, {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, {CNKI} (Chinese database), {VIP} (Chinese database), {WanFang} (Chinese database), and {SinoMed} (Chinese database) databases from their inception until December 31, 2021. The retrieved literature was screened and assessed independently by two authors. We used the risk-of-bias assessment tool recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 5.0.2 for assessing literature quality and Revman 5.3 software to conduct the meta-analysis. Fifteen articles were included in this study. The results of the systematic review indicated that telemedicine consultation and telemonitoring are the most commonly used intervention methods. Telemedicine is helpful for improving self-management in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The results of the meta-analysis showed patients’ index of glycosylated hemoglobin ({HbA}1c) improved after 12\&nbsp;months of intervention ({MD} =  − 0.84; 95\% {CI} =  − 1.53, − 0.16; Z = 2.42; P = 0.02), and no significant differences in fasting blood glucose ({FBG}) levels were observed after 6\&nbsp;months of intervention ({MD} =  − 0.35; 95\% {CI} =  − 0.75,0.06; Z = 1.69; P = 0.09). The results also showed that systolic blood pressure ({MD} =  − 6.71; 95\% {CI} =  − 11.40, − 2.02; Z = 2.81; P = 0.005) was reduced after 6\&nbsp;months of intervention. Telemedicine had a positive effect on the management of diabetes, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis, especially when telemedicine consultation and telemonitoring method were used. When telemedicine was used as a disease management tool for patients with diabetes, the optimal intervention time is 12\&nbsp;months. Telemedicine improved the systolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients while also reducing negative emotions and enhancing medication adherence in rheumatoid arthritis patients.},

We reviewed emerging trends in hypertension population health management and present implementation considerations from an intervention called Team-supported, Electronic health record-leveraged, Active Management ({TEAM}). By doing so, we highlight the role of population health managers, practitioners who use population level data and to proactively engage at-risk patients, in improving blood pressure control. Within a population health paradigm, we discuss telehealth-delivered approaches to equitably improve hypertension care delivery. Additionally, we explore implementation considerations and complementary features of team-based, telehealth-delivered, population health management. By leveraging the unique role and expertise of a population health manager as core member of team-based telehealth, health systems can implement a cost-effective and scalable intervention that addresses multi-level barriers to hypertension care delivery. We describe the literature of telehealth-based population health management for patients with hypertension. Using the {TEAM} intervention as a case study, we then present implementation considerations and intervention adaptations to integrate a population health manager within the health care team and effectively manage hypertension for a defined patient population. We emphasize practical considerations to inform implementation, scaling, and sustainability. We highlight future research directions to advance the field and support translational efforts in diverse clinical and community contexts.},

	abstract = {The term "real-world evidence" is widely used by those who develop medical products or who study, deliver, or pay for health care, but its specific meaning is elusive. We believe it refers to information on health care that is derived from multiple sources outside typical clinical research settings, including electronic health records ({EHRs}), claims and billing data, product and disease registries, and data gathered through personal devices and health applications. 1,2 Key to understanding the usefulness of real-world evidence is an appreciation of its potential for complementing the knowledge gained from traditional clinical trials, whose well-known limitations make it difficult to generalize findings to larger, more inclusive populations of patients, providers, and health care delivery systems or settings that reflect actual use in practice. 3 Real-world evidence can inform therapeutic development, outcomes research, patient care, research on health care systems, quality improvement , safety surveillance, and well-controlled effectiveness studies. Real-world evidence can also provide information on how factors such as clinical setting and provider and health-system characteristics influence treatment effects and outcomes. Importantly, the use of such evidence has the potential to allow researchers to answer these questions efficiently, saving time and money while yielding answers relevant to broader populations of patients than would be possible in a specialized research environment. 4,5 As defined above, real-world evidence can be viewed as a means of incorporating diverse types of evidence into information on health care. However, the confluence of large data sets of uncertain quality and provenance, the facile analytic tools that can be used by nonexperts, and a shortage of researchers with adequate methodo-logic savvy could result in poorly conceived study and analytic designs that generate incorrect or unreliable conclusions. Accordingly, if we are to realize the full promise of such evidence, we must be clear about what it is and how it can be used most effectively, and we must have appropriate expectations about what it can tell us. It is important to distinguish two key dimensions of real-world evidence. The first is the setting in which evidence is generated, which includes the population defined by the data source as well as the specific methods used to collect and curate the data on that population. The second is the methodologic approach used to conduct the surveillance or research. Rese arch Se t tings-Tr aditional Trial s vs. Re al World "Traditional" clinical trials are often conducted with specific populations and in specialized environments that differ from the realities of clinical or home settings. These trials may take measures designed to control variability and to ensure the quality of the data they generate, such as the development of long lists of eligibility criteria, the use of detailed case-report forms that exist separately from ordinary medical records , and the use of intensive monitoring and specialized research personnel to ensure adherence to a well-characterized protocol that defines study procedures and ensures precision in data collection. The clinical trial unquestionably remains a powerful tool for developing scientific evidence about the safety and efficacy of a medical product while informing our understanding of the The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm.org at {UNIVERSITAET} {ULM} /{KIZ} on January 3, 2017.

One method of using outcome data to improve health care value is the disease registry. An international study of thirteen registries in five countries (Australia, Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States) suggests that by making outcome data transparent to both practitioners and the public, well-managed registries enable medical professionals to engage in continuous learning and to identify and share best clinical practices. The apparent result: improved health outcomes, often at lower cost. For example, we calculate that if the United States had a registry for hip replacement surgery comparable to one in Sweden that enabled reductions in the rates at which these surgeries are performed a second time to replace or repair hip prostheses, the United States would avoid \$2 billion of an expected \$24 billion in total costs for these surgeries in 2015.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE} - To assess the ability to identify potential association(s) of diabetes medications with myocardial infarction using usual care clinical data obtained from the electronic medical record. {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS} - We defined a retrospective cohort of patients (n = 34,253) treated with a sulfonylurea, metformin, rosiglitazone, or pioglitazone in a single academic health care network. All patients were aged {\textgreater} 18 years with at least one prescription for one of the medications between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2006. The study outcome was acute myocardial infarction requiring hospitalization. We used a cumulative temporal approach to ascertain the calendar date for earliest identifiable risk associated with rosiglitazone compared with that for other therapies. {RESULTS} - Sulfonylurea, metformin, rosiglitazone, or pioglitazone therapy was prescribed for 11,200, 12,490, 1,879, and 806 patients, respectively. A total of 1,343 myocardial infarctions were identified. After adjustment for potential myocardial infarction risk factors, the relative risk for myocardial infarction with rosiglitazone was 1.3 (95\% {CI} 1.1-1.6) compared with sulfonylurea, 2.2 (1.6-3.1) compared with metformin, and 2.2 (1.5-3.4) compared with pioglitazone. Prospective surveillance using these data would have identified increased risk for myocardial infarction with rosiglitazone compared with metformin within 18 months of its introduction with a risk ratio of 2.1 (95\% {CI} 1.2-3.8). {CONCLUSIONS} - Our results are consistent with a relative adverse cardiovascular risk profile for rosiglitazone. Our use of usual care electronic data sources from a large hospital network represents an innovative approach to rapid safety signal detection that may enable more effective postmarketing drug surveillance. © 2010 by the American Diabetes Association.},

We used 2008-14 national data, which includes the most recently available, to examine hospital {EHR} trends. We found large gains in adoption, with 75 percent of {US} hospitals now having adopted at least a basic {EHR} system-up from 59 percent in 2013. However, small and rural hospitals continue to lag behind. Among hospitals without a basic {EHR} system, the function most often not yet adopted (in 61 percent of hospitals) was physician notes. We also saw large increases in the ability to meet core stage 2 meaningful-use criteria (40.5 percent of hospitals, up from 5.8 percent in 2013); much of this progress resulted from increased ability to meet criteria related to exchange of health information with patients and with other physicians during care transitions. Finally, hospitals most often reported up-front and ongoing costs, physician cooperation, and complexity of meeting meaningful-use criteria as challenges. Our findings suggest that nationwide hospital {EHR} adoption is in reach but will require attention to small and rural hospitals and strategies to address financial challenges, particularly now that penalties for lack of adoption have begun.},

We estimated glomerular filtration rate ({eGFR}) from serum creatinine and defined {CKD} as Stage 3, 4, or 5 {CKD} by {eGFR} criterion according to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines. Renal-related {ICD}-9-{CM} codes were grouped by algorithm. Principal Findings. Prevalence of {CKD} was 31.6 percent in the veteran sample with diabetes. Depending on the detail of the algorithm, only 20.2 to 42.4 percent of individuals with {CKD} received a renal-related diagnosis code in either {VA} or Medicare records over 1 year. Specificity of renal codes for {CKD} ranged from 93.2 to 99.4 percent. Patients hospitalized in {VA} facilities were slightly more likely to be correctly coded for {CKD} than patients hospitalized in facilities reimbursed by Medicare ({OR} 5.4 versus 4.1, p=.0330) Conclusions. {CKD} is a common comorbidity for patients with diabetes in the {VA} system. Diagnosis codes in administrative records from Medicare and {VA} systems are insensitive, but specific markers for patients with {CKD}. © Health Research and Educational Trust.},

	abstract = {Background: Diabetes and hypertension are the 2 leading risk factors for suboptimal cardiovascular and renal outcomes. These 2 conditions often coexist and can benefit from antihypertensive therapy, which may lead to blood pressure control and reduced risk for nephropathy (as evidenced by albuminuria). Objective: To quantify the trends of antihypertensive drug use and to assess the impact of antihypertensive treatment on the prevalence of blood pressure control and albuminuria, among {US} adults with coexisting diabetes and hypertension. Methods: In this serial cross-sectional study, we analyzed data from the 1999-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 3586). We determine the prevalence of antihypertensive use, drug classes used, and their association with blood pressure control and albuminuria. Results: During the study period, the study population experienced substantial increase in antihypertensive treatment (from 84.6\% in 1999-2002 to 90.1\% in 2011-2014, Ptrend {\textless}.01) and blood pressure control (from 37.1\% to 46.9\%, Ptrend {\textless}.01) and decrease in albuminuria (from 39.1\% to 31.3\%, Ptrend =.02). These trends were particularly pronounced in the subgroups using angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin {II} receptor blockers. In multivariate analysis, Blacks, Hispanics, and males were found more likely to have albuminuria than their respective counterparts. Achieving blood pressure control (odds ratio = 0.40, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 0.32-0.49) was associated with lower rates of albuminuria. Conclusion And Relevance: Despite continued improvement in antihypertensive therapy, the burden of uncontrolled blood pressure and albuminuria remains substantial among {US} adults with diabetes and hypertension. Tailoring pharmacotherapy based on patient characteristics and comorbidities is needed to further improve these outcomes.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Antihypertensive agents are frequently prescribed in kidney transplant recipients ({KTRs}). However, the frequency and patterns of prescribing antihypertensive agents remain uncharacterized in {KTRs} in China. Therefore, this investigation was carried out. Methods: Retrospective prescription data dated 2011 to 2018 from {KTRs} in China were accessed using the Hospital Prescription Analysis Program database. Information about sex, birth date, and identification number of the patient; city, date, and department of the medical visit; major diagnoses; and the generic names, specifications, quantities, and usage of prescribed drugs were collected. Antihypertensive agents were grouped into 5 classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ({ACEIs}), angiotensin receptor blockers ({ARBs}), β-blockers ({BBs}), calcium channel blockers ({CCBs}), and diuretics. The frequency and patterns of prescribing these antihypertensive agents were analyzed. Findings: Prescriptions from 174,749 {KTRs} (67.2\% male; mean age, 42.5 [9.4] years) were obtained, and 58.2\% of the patients were prescribed antihypertensive agents. The percentage of patients who received antihypertensive treatment increased from 52.9\% in 2011 to 61.6\% in 2018 and varied by city. Cyclosporine was associated with higher prescription frequency of antihypertensive agents than was tacrolimus (71.7\% vs 63.4\%; P {\textless} 0.0001). During the 8-year study period, {CCBs} were most frequently prescribed (39.0\%), followed by {ARBs} (31.9\%), {BBs} (14.3\%), {ACEIs} (11.6\%), and diuretics (3.2\%). The mean ({SD}) number of antihypertensive drugs prescribed per {KTR} was 1.7 (0.8). Almost half of {KTRs} (51.2\%) received just 1 antihypertensive drug. Co-administration of 2 or more antihypertensive drugs presented an obviously upward trend. The most commonly prescribed 2-drug combination was {CCB} + {ARB} (44.8\%), followed by {CCB} + {BB} (20.1\%) and {CCB} + {ACEI} (13.0\%). In the patients who received 3 antihypertensive drugs, the 2 most frequently prescribed combinations were {CCB} + {ARB} + {BB} (37.5\%) and {CCB} + {ARB} + {ACEI} (32.7\%). Specific data varied by both year and city. Implications: The prescribing patterns of antihypertensive agents in {KTRs} varied by city even within same country. Hence, more high-quality research studies on the use of antihypertensive agents in {KTRs} are needed.},

	abstract = {Background: Aim of our study was to compare adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy between newly treated patients in whom monotherapy or a 2-drug single-pill combination ({SPC}) was initially dispensed. Methods: The 63,448 residents of Lombardy Region (Italy), aged 40-80 years, who were newly treated with antihypertensive drugs during 2016, were identified and followed for 1 year after the first prescription. The outcome of interest was adherence to drug therapy that was measured according to the "proportion of days covered"({PDC}) criterion, i.e., the ratio between the number of days in which the drug was available and the days of follow-up. Patients who had a {PDC} {\textgreater}75\% and {\textless}25\% were defined as highly and poorly adherent to drug therapy, respectively. Log-binomial regression models were fitted to compare the propensity to treatment adherence between the initial therapeutic strategies, after adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical covariates. Results: About 46\% and 17\% of patients showed high and poor adherence, respectively. Compared with patients under initial monotherapy (85\%), those who were initially treated with a {SPC} (15\%) had higher propensity to be highly adherent and a lower propensity to be poorly adherent to antihypertensive treatment (risk ratio: 1.18, 95\% confidence interval 1.16-1.21; 0.42, 0.39-0.45, respectively). This was the case regardless the sex, the age, the patient clinical status, and with almost any type of {SPC}. Conclusions: In a real-life setting, patients who were initially prescribed a 2-drug {SPC} exhibited more frequently a good adherence to antihypertensive treatment than those starting with a single drug.},

Methods All initial users of antihypertensive drugs in 2005 and 2009 registered in the Norwegian Prescription Database were included. Treatment on five index dates at 1-year intervals was recorded. A patient was considered to be under treatment on an index date if a drug had been dispensed within the previous 180 days and to have maintained treatment persistence if he/she was on any antihypertensive treatment on the index date and all previous index dates. Results Among 78,453 new users of antihypertensives in 2005, women started more often with {TZs} than men (30 vs. 25 \%) and less often with {ARBs} (22 vs. 25 \%). In men, the hazard of non-persistence with antihypertensive treatment was significantly lower among initial {ARB} users than among {TZ} users (hazard ratio 0.87, 95 \% confidence interval 0.81-0.94); in women no significant difference was found. After 4 years, 49 \% of the men and 51 \% of the women who had started with plain {TZs} were still using {TZs}, whereas 65 \% of the male {ARB} users and 60 \% of the female {ARB} users were still using {ARBs}. Conclusion {TZs} and {ARBs} were the most widely used firstline antihypertensives. Among the men enrolled in the study, {ARB} users had a somewhat better persistence with antihypertensive treatment than {TZ} users. Among both genders, continuation on {ARBs} was more common than continuation on {TZs}. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

	abstract = {Evidence for the effectiveness and safety of the third-generation β-blockers other than atenolol in hypertension remains scarce. We assessed the effectiveness and safety of β-blockers as first-line treatment for hypertension using 3 databases in the United States: 2 administrative claims databases and 1 electronic health record-based database from 2001 to 2018. In each database, comparative effectiveness of β-blockers for the risks of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure was assessed, using large-scale propensity adjustment and empirical calibration. Estimates were combined across databases using random-effects meta-analyses. Overall, 118 133 and 267 891 patients initiated third-generation β-blockers (carvedilol and nebivolol) or atenolol, respectively. The pooled hazard ratios ({HRs}) of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, and most metabolic complications were not different between the third-generation β-blockers versus atenolol after propensity score matching and empirical calibration ({HR}, 1.07 [95\% {CI}, 0.74-1.55] for acute myocardial infarction; {HR}, 1.06 [95\% {CI}, 0.87-1.31] for stroke; {HR}, 1.46 [95\% {CI}, 0.99-2.24] for hospitalized heart failure). Third-generation β-blockers were associated with significantly higher risk of stroke than {ACE} (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors ({HR}, 1.29 [95\% {CI}, 1.03-1.72]) and thiazide diuretics ({HR}, 1.56 [95\% {CI}, 1.17-2.20]). In conclusion, this study found many patients with first-line β-blocker monotherapy for hypertension and no statistically significant differences in the effectiveness and safety comparing atenolol with third-generation β-blockers.

	abstract = {Background: Beta-blockers refer to a mixed group of drugs with diverse pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. They have shown long-term beneficial effects on mortality and cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) when used in people with heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension. However, the benefit of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension without compelling indications is controversial. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review initially published in 2007 and updated in 2012. Objectives: To assess the effects of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality endpoints in adults with hypertension. Search methods: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to June 2016: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ({CENTRAL}) (2016, Issue 6), {MEDLINE} (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and {ClinicalTrials}.gov. We checked reference lists of relevant reviews, and reference lists of studies potentially eligible for inclusion in this review, and also searched the the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 06 July 2015. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}) of at least one year of duration, which assessed the effects of beta-blockers compared to placebo or other drugs, as first-line therapy for hypertension, on mortality and morbidity in adults. Data collection and analysis: We selected studies and extracted data in duplicate, resolving discrepancies by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios ({RR}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) and conducted fixed-effect or random-effects meta-analyses, as appropriate. We also used {GRADE} to assess the certainty of the evidence. {GRADE} classifies the certainty of evidence as high (if we are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect), moderate (if the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect), low (if the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect), and very low (if we are very uncertain about the estimate of effect). Main results: Thirteen {RCTs} met inclusion criteria. They compared beta-blockers to placebo (4 {RCTs}, 23,613 participants), diuretics (5 {RCTs}, 18,241 participants), calcium-channel blockers ({CCBs}: 4 {RCTs}, 44,825 participants), and renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}) inhibitors (3 {RCTs}, 10,828 participants). These {RCTs} were conducted between the 1970s and 2000s and most of them had a high risk of bias resulting from limitations in study design, conduct, and data analysis. There were 40,245 participants taking beta-blockers, three-quarters of them taking atenolol. We found no outcome trials involving the newer vasodilating beta-blockers (e.g. nebivolol). There was no difference in all-cause mortality between beta-blockers and placebo ({RR} 0.99, 95\% {CI} 0.88 to 1.11), diuretics or {RAS} inhibitors, but it was higher for beta-blockers compared to {CCBs} ({RR} 1.07, 95\% {CI} 1.00 to 1.14). The evidence on mortality was of moderate-certainty for all comparisons. Total {CVD} was lower for beta-blockers compared to placebo ({RR} 0.88, 95\% {CI} 0.79 to 0.97; low-certainty evidence), a reflection of the decrease in stroke ({RR} 0.80, 95\% {CI} 0.66 to 0.96; low-certainty evidence) since there was no difference in coronary heart disease ({CHD}: {RR} 0.93, 95\% {CI} 0.81 to 1.07; moderate-certainty evidence). The effect of beta-blockers on {CVD} was worse than that of {CCBs} ({RR} 1.18, 95\% {CI} 1.08 to 1.29; moderate-certainty evidence), but was not different from that of diuretics (moderate-certainty) or {RAS} inhibitors (low-certainty). In addition, there was an increase in stroke in beta-blockers compared to {CCBs} ({RR} 1.24, 95\% {CI} 1.11 to 1.40; moderate-certainty evidence) and {RAS} inhibitors ({RR} 1.30, 95\% {CI} 1.11 to 1.53; moderate-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference in {CHD} between beta-blockers and diuretics (low-certainty evidence), {CCBs} (moderate-certainty evidence) or {RAS} inhibitors (low-certainty evidence). In the single trial involving participants aged 65 years and older, atenolol was associated with an increased {CHD} incidence compared to diuretics ({RR} 1.63, 95\% {CI} 1.15 to 2.32). Participants taking beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events than participants taking {RAS} inhibitors ({RR} 1.41, 95\% {CI} 1.29 to 1.54; moderate-certainty evidence), but there was little or no difference with placebo, diuretics or {CCBs} (low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: Most outcome {RCTs} on beta-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension have high risk of bias. Atenolol was the beta-blocker most used. Current evidence suggests that initiating treatment of hypertension with beta-blockers leads to modest {CVD} reductions and little or no effects on mortality. These beta-blocker effects are inferior to those of other antihypertensive drugs. Further research should be of high quality and should explore whether there are differences between different subtypes of beta-blockers or whether beta-blockers have differential effects on younger and older people.},

Patients and Methods Meta-analysis of randomized trials identified using {PubMed}, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials searches from January 1, 1980, through April 13, 2015, of {ACEis} and {ARBs} compared with placebo or active controls and corroborated with head-to-head trials of {ARBs} vs {ACEis}. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction ({MI}), angina, stroke, heart failure, revascularization, and new-onset diabetes. Results Our search yielded 106 randomized trials that enrolled 254,301 patients. Compared with placebo, {ACEis} but not {ARBs} reduced the outcomes of all-cause mortality ({ACEis} vs placebo: relative risk [{RR}], 0.89; 95\% {CI}, 0.80-1.00; {ARBs} vs placebo: {RR}, 1.01; 95\% {CI}, 0.96-1.06; Pinteraction=.04), cardiovascular death ({RR}, 0.83; 95\% {CI}, 0.70-0.99 and {RR}, 1.02; 95\% {CI}, 0.92-1.14; Pinteraction=.05), and {MI} ({RR}, 0.83; 95\% {CI}, 0.78-0.90 and {RR}, 0.93; 95\% {CI}, 0.85-1.03; Pinteraction=.06). The meta-regression analysis revealed that the difference between {ACEis} and {ARBs} compared with placebo was due to a higher placebo event rate in the {ACEis} trials (most of these trials were conducted a decade earlier than the {ARB} trials) for the outcome of all-cause mortality (P=.001), cardiovascular death (P{\textless}.001), and {MI} (P=.02). Sensitivity analyses restricted to trials published after 2000 revealed similar outcomes with {ACEis} vs placebo and {ARBs} vs placebo (Pinteraction{\textgreater}.05). Head-to-head comparison trials of {ARBs} vs {ACEis} exhibited no difference in outcomes except for a lower risk of drug withdrawal due to adverse effects with {ARBs} ({RR}, 0.72; 95\% {CI}, 0.65-0.81). Conclusion In patients without heart failure, evidence from placebo-controlled trials (restricted to trials after 2000), active controlled trials, and head-to-head randomized trials all suggest {ARBs} to be as efficacious and safe as {ACEis}, with the added advantage of better tolerability.},

	abstract = {{ACE} (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ({ARBs}) are equally guideline-recommended first-line treatments for hypertension, yet few head-to-head studies exist. We compared the real-world effectiveness and safety of {ACE} inhibitors versus {ARBs} in the first-line treatment of hypertension. We implemented a retrospective, new-user comparative cohort design to estimate hazard ratios using techniques to minimize residual confounding and bias, specifically large-scale propensity score adjustment, empirical calibration, and full transparency. We included all patients with hypertension initiating monotherapy with an {ACE} inhibitor or {ARB} between 1996 and 2018 across 8 databases from the United States, Germany, and South Korea. The primary outcomes were acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and composite cardiovascular events. We also studied 51 secondary and safety outcomes including angioedema, cough, syncope, and electrolyte abnormalities. Across 8 databases, we identified 2 297 881 patients initiating treatment with {ACE} inhibitors and 673 938 patients with {ARBs}. We found no statistically significant difference in the primary outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 1.11 for {ACE} versus {ARB} [95\% {CI}, 0.95-1.32]), heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.03 [0.87-1.24]), stroke (hazard ratio, 1.07 [0.91-1.27]), or composite cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 1.06 [0.90-1.25]). Across secondary and safety outcomes, patients on {ARBs} had significantly lower risk of angioedema, cough, pancreatitis, and {GI} bleeding. In our large-scale, observational network study, {ARBs} do not differ statistically significantly in effectiveness at the class level compared with {ACE} inhibitors as first-line treatment for hypertension but present a better safety profile. These findings support preferentially prescribing {ARBs} over {ACE} inhibitors when initiating treatment for hypertension.},

Many adults require 2 or more classes of antihypertensive medication to achieve guideline-recommended {BP} goals, but the proportion of {US} adults taking antihypertensive medication monotherapy, versus combination therapy, has not been quantified using contemporary data. We analyzed data from 2005 to 2008, 2009 to 2012, and 2013 to 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to determine trends in monotherapy and combinations of antihypertensive medication classes among {US} adults age ≥20 years with hypertension taking antihypertensive medication (n=7837). The proportion of {US} adults taking antihypertensive medication with uncontrolled {BP} (ie, systolic {BP} ≥140 or diastolic {BP} ≥90 mm Hg) was 32.3\%, 30.2\%, and 31.0\% in 2005 to 2008, 2009 to 2012, and 2013 to 2016, respectively (Ptrend=0.37).

Identifying factors associated with monotherapy use despite uncontrolled blood pressure ({BP}) overall and within race/ethnic groups may elucidate intervention targets in under-treated populations. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ({NHANES}; 2013-2014 through 2017-2018). We included participants age ≥20 years with hypertension, taking at least one antihypertensive medication, and uncontrolled {BP} (systolic {BP} [{SBP}] ≥ 140 {mmHg} or diastolic {BP} [{DBP}] ≥ 90 {mmHg}). Demographic, clinical, and healthcare-access factors associated with antihypertensive monotherapy were determined using multivariable-adjusted Poisson regression. Results: Among 1,597 participants with hypertension and uncontrolled {BP}, age- and sex- adjusted prevalence of monotherapy was 42.6\% overall, 45.4\% among non-Hispanic White, 31.9\% among non-Hispanic Black, 39.6\% among Hispanic, and 50.9\% among non-Hispanic Asian adults. Overall, higher {SBP} was associated with higher monotherapy use, while older age, having a healthcare visit in the previous year, higher body mass index, and having heart failure were associated with lower monotherapy use.

	abstract = {Background Evidence-based and age-appropriate antihypertensive pharmacotherapy in outpatient settings is essential for optimal treatment outcomes. Recent guidelines, although controversial, recommended different blood pressure goals using age cutoff of 60 years. We describe recent age-specific national trends in antihypertensive prescribing patterns and blood pressure control in {US} office-based practices. Methods We analyzed all hypertension-related visits to physician offices from the latest available National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2003-2010). We identified trends of antihypertensive prescribing overall and by class, trends of hypertension control, age differences in antihypertensive prescribing patterns and hypertension control, predicted probabilities of hypertension control in subgroups, and correlates of hypertension control. Results There were 16,729 physician office visits included in the analysis. Overall, the prescription of antihypertensive medication increased from 69.2\% in 2003-2004 to 78.8\% in 2009-2010 (Ptrend = .001), and the increased trend was consistent in both age groups ({\textless}60 and ≥60 years). This was accompanied by an improvement in the overall hypertension control (from 39.1\% to 48.8\%, Ptrend {\textless}.001). Antihypertensive prescribing patterns differ significantly between the 2 age groups. The proportions of visits with β-blocker (from 25.4\% to 34.7\%, Ptrend {\textless}.001) and angiotensin receptor blocker prescriptions (from 17.0\% to 22.1\%, Ptrend = .042) increased for older patients. The increased trend of β-blocker use persisted after excluding patients with compelling indications. Among treated patients, lower odds of blood pressure control were associated with African American race, presence of comorbidities, younger age, and insufficient insurance coverage. Conclusions In office-based practices, antihypertensive medication prescribing among {US} adults with hypertension increased significantly in recent years, which was accompanied by improvement in hypertension control. The prescribing patterns differed among younger and older patients, but continuous use of β-blockers without other compelling indications raises concerns.},

We selected patients with a diagnosis of {HTN} and identified those prescribed antihypertensive therapies. We analyzed the type of antihypertensive agents prescribed. Extent of {BP} control, and associated patient and physician characteristics. We calculated 95\% confidence intervals that accounted for the multistage {NDTI} sampling design. {RESULTS} Among those treated for {HTN} in 2014, {BP} control varied: systolic {BP} ({SBP}) =160 (15\%) vs. {SBP} 150-159 (9\%) vs. {SBP} 140-149 (19\%) vs. {SBP} 130-139 (26\%) vs. {SBP} {\textless}130 (32\%).

	abstract = {Background - A key to reduce and eradicate racial disparities in hypertension outcomes is to understand their causes. We aimed at evaluating racial differences in antihypertensive drug utilization patterns and blood pressure control by insurance status, age, sex, and presence of comorbidities. Methods and Results - A total of 8796 hypertensive individuals ≥18 years of age were identified from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2012) in a repeated cross-sectional study. During the study period, all 3 racial groups (whites, blacks, and Hispanics) experienced substantial increase in hypertension treatment and control. The overall treatment rates were 73.9\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 71.6\%-76.2\%), 70.8\% (95\% {CI}, 68.6\%-73.0\%), and 60.7\% (95\% {CI}, 57.0\%-64.3\%) and hypertension control rates were 42.9\% (95\% {CI}, 40.5\%-45.2\%), 36.9\% (95\% {CI}, 34.7\%-39.2\%), and 31.2\% (95\% {CI}, 28.6\%-33.9\%) for whites, blacks, and Hispanics, respectively. When stratified by insurance status, blacks (odds ratio, 0.74 [95\% {CI}, 0.64-0.86] for insured and 0.59 [95\% {CI}, 0.36-0.94] for uninsured) and Hispanics (odds ratio, 0.74 [95\% {CI}, 0.60-0.91] for insured and 0.58 [95\% {CI}, 0.36-0.94] for uninsured) persistently had lower rates of hypertension control compared with whites. Racial disparities also persisted in subgroups stratified by age (≥60 and {\textless}60 years of age) and presence of comorbidities but worsened among patients {\textless}60 years of age. Conclusions - Black and Hispanic patients had poorer hypertension control compared with whites, and these differences were more pronounced in younger and uninsured patients. Although black patients received more intensive antihypertensive therapy, Hispanics were undertreated. Future studies should further explore all aspects of these disparities to improve cardiovascular outcomes.},

Over the past decade, new antihypertensive therapies have been developed, several have lost patent protection and additional evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of these agents has accrued. Objective: To examine trends in the use of antihypertensive therapies in the United States between 1997 and 2012. Design, Setting and Participants: We used nationally representative audit data from the {IMS} Health National Disease and Therapeutic Index to examine the ambulatory pharmacologic treatment of hypertension. Outcome Measures: Our primary unit of analysis was a visit where hypertension was a reported diagnosis and treated with a pharmacotherapy (treatment visit). We restricted analyses to the use of six therapeutic classes of antihypertensive medications among individuals 18 years or older. Results: Annual hypertension treatment visits increased from 56.9 million treatment visits (95\% confidence intervals [{CI}], 53.9-59.8) in 1997 to 83.3 million visits ({CI} 79.2-87.3) in 2008, then declined steadily to 70.9 million visits ({CI} 66.7-75.0) by 2012. Angiotensin receptor blocker utilization increased substantially from 3\% of treatment visits in 1997 to 18\% by 2012, whereas calcium channel blocker use decreased from 27\% to 18\% of visits. Rates of diuretic and beta-blocker use remained stable and represented 24\%-30\% and 14-16\% of visits, respectively. Use of direct renin inhibitor accounted for fewer than 2\% of annual visits. The proportion of visits treated using fixed-dose combination therapies increased from 28\% to 37\% of visits. Conclusions: Several important changes have occurred in the landscape of antihypertensive treatment in the United States during the past decade. Despite their novel mechanism of action, the adoption rate of direct renin inhibitors remains low.},

	abstract = {Background. Recent guidelines recommended different approaches to hypertension therapy. Our aim was to evaluate trends in blood pressure ({BP}) management among patients admitted with acute stroke over the past decade. Methods. The study population comprised 6279 consecutive patients, admitted with an acute stroke, and included in a national registry of three consecutive periods conducted during the years 2004-2010. We compared patients' characteristics and temporal trends of antihypertensive therapy utilization before hospital admission. Results. Among 4727 hypertensive patients, 3940 (83\%) patients have taken antihypertensive drug therapy-1430 (30.2\%) a single agent, 1500 (31.7\%) two agents and 1010 (21.4\%) three or more antihypertensive agents. The most common class used was renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}) blockers (n = 2575; 54\%) followed by beta-blockers (n = 2033; 43\%). The same pattern was observed in patients treated with monotherapy. The use of {RAS} blockers and beta-blockers has increased over the years (p {\textless} 0.001 for both), whereas the use of diuretics decreased and the use of calcium antagonists remained stable. Among those who were treated with a single agent, the use of diuretics and calcium antagonists decreased and the use of {RAS} blockers increased, whereas the use of beta-blockers remained unchanged. Conclusions. {RAS} blockers and beta-blockers are the most common antihypertensive agents used in Israel. Over time, the use of {RAS} blockers and beta-blockers has increased, whereas the use of diuretics decreased.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundBlood} pressure ({BP}) control in China is generally poor. It is assumed that an important cause of this unsatisfactory situation is the present standard of care provided by primary care physicians.{METHODSOne} thousand community health centers ({CHCs}) were selected across China based on geographical location, previous cooperative experience, and acceptance of an invitation to implement a standardized protocol of community-based {BP} management. Baseline information for each hypertensive patient under the care of these {CHCs} was collected, and the present pattern of hypertensive drug treatment was analyzed.{RESULTS} Of all identified hypertensive patients (n = 249,830), 37\% were treated with drugs. Characteristics linked with hypertension treatment included systolic {BP}, age, sex, region, smoking and alcohol consumption status, body mass index, comorbidities, and family history the most frequently prescribed classes of antihypertensive drugs were diuretics (56.0\%), followed by centrally active drugs ({CADs}) (38.3\%), calcium channel blockers ({CCBs}) (36.8\%), vasodilators (26.5\%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ({ACEIs}) (23.3\%). In regards to drug combination patterns, diuretics plus {CADs} was the most frequently used 2-drug combination (61.4\%) and vasodilators plus {CADs} plus diuretics was the most frequently used 3-drug therapy (69.2\%). Seventy-seven percent of patients on combination therapy were prescribed single pill combinations, 87.2\% of which were composed of {CADs} and vasodilators and 12.8\% of which were composed of {ACEIs} and diuretics the control rates of patients on monotherapy and combination therapy were 27.7\% and 24.1\% (P {\textless} 0.05), respectively.{CONCLUSIONSOur} study identified major shortcomings in the present status of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy in routine medical practice in China. It is essential to implement a program of professional education regarding the appropriate use of antihypertensive drugs. © 2013 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Ulcerative colitis ({UC}) and Crohn's disease ({CD}), collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ({IBD}), are caused by a complex interplay between genetic, immunologic, microbial and environmental factors. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is increasingly considered to be causatively related to {IBD} and is strongly affected by components of a Western life style. Bacteria that ferment fibers and produce short chain fatty acids ({SCFAs}) are typically reduced in mucosa and feces of patients with {IBD}, as compared to healthy individuals. {SCFAs}, such as acetate, propionate and butyrate, are important metabolites in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Several studies have indeed shown that fecal {SCFAs} levels are reduced in active {IBD}. {SCFAs} are an important fuel for intestinal epithelial cells and are known to strengthen the gut barrier function. Recent findings, however, show that {SCFAs}, and in particular butyrate, also have important immunomodulatory functions. Absorption of {SCFAs} is facilitated by substrate transporters like {MCT}1 and {SMCT}1 to promote cellular metabolism. Moreover, {SCFAs} may signal through cell surface G-protein coupled receptors ({GPCRs}), like {GPR}41, {GPR}43, and {GPR}109A, to activate signaling cascades that control immune functions. Transgenic mouse models support the key role of these {GPCRs} in controlling intestinal inflammation. Here, we present an overview of microbial {SCFAs} production and their effects on the intestinal mucosa with specific emphasis on their relevance for {IBD}. Moreover, we discuss the therapeutic potential of {SCFAs} for {IBD}, either applied directly or by stimulating {SCFAs}-producing bacteria through pre- or probiotic approaches.},

We performed deep metagenomic sequencing of 1,203 gut microbiomes from 1,098 individuals enrolled in the Personalised Responses to Dietary Composition Trial ({PREDICT} 1) study, whose detailed long-term diet information, as well as hundreds of fasting and same-meal postprandial cardiometabolic blood marker measurements were available. We found many significant associations between microbes and specific nutrients, foods, food groups and general dietary indices, which were driven especially by the presence and diversity of healthy and plant-based foods. Microbial biomarkers of obesity were reproducible across external publicly available cohorts and in agreement with circulating blood metabolites that are indicators of cardiovascular disease risk. While some microbes, such as Prevotella copri and Blastocystis spp., were indicators of favorable postprandial glucose metabolism, overall microbiome composition was predictive for a large panel of cardiometabolic blood markers including fasting and postprandial glycemic, lipemic and inflammatory indices. The panel of intestinal species associated with healthy dietary habits overlapped with those associated with favorable cardiometabolic and postprandial markers, indicating that our large-scale resource can potentially stratify the gut microbiome into generalizable health levels in individuals without clinically manifest disease. Analyses from the gut microbiome of over 1,000 individuals from the {PREDICT} 1 study, for which detailed long-term diet information as well as hundreds of fasting and same-meal postprandial cardiometabolic blood marker measurements are available, unveil new associations between specific gut microbes, dietary habits and cardiometabolic health.},

Strains have, in the past, been largely defined and characterized based on microbial isolates. However, the emergence of new technologies and techniques has enabled assessments of their ecology and phenotypes within microbial communities and the human microbiome. While it is now more obvious how pathogenic strain variants are detrimental to human health, the consequences of subtle genetic variation in the microbiome have only recently been exposed. Here, we review the operational definitions of strains (e.g., genetic and structural variants) as they can now be identified from microbial communities using different high-throughput, often culture-independent techniques. We summarize the distribution and diversity of strains across the human body and their emerging links to health maintenance, disease risk and progression, and biochemical responses to perturbations, such as diet or drugs. We list methods for identifying, quantifying, and tracking strains, utilizing high-throughput sequencing along with other molecular and "culturomics"technologies. Finally, we discuss implications of population studies in bridging experimental gaps and leading to a better understanding of the health effects of strains in the human microbiome.},

Leveraging this approach to understand roles of microbes in human biology and other environments requires quantitative data summaries whose values are comparable across samples and studies. Comparability is currently hampered by the use of abundance statistics that do not estimate a meaningful parameter of the microbial community and biases introduced by experimental protocols and data-cleaning approaches. Addressing these challenges, along with improving study design, data access, metadata standardization, and analysis tools, will enable accurate comparative metagenomics. We envision a future in which microbiome studies are replicable and new metagenomes are easily and rapidly integrated with existing data.

	abstract = {Background: Endovascular renal denervation reduces blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, but its efficacy in patients with true resistant hypertension has not been shown. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of endovascular ultrasound renal denervation in patients with hypertension resistant to three or more antihypertensive medications. Methods: In a randomised, international, multicentre, single-blind, sham-controlled trial done at 28 tertiary centres in the {USA} and 25 in Europe, we included patients aged 18–75 years with office blood pressure of at least 140/90 mm Hg despite three or more antihypertensive medications including a diuretic. Eligible patients were switched to a once daily, fixed-dose, single-pill combination of a calcium channel blocker, an angiotensin receptor blocker, and a thiazide diuretic. After 4 weeks of standardised therapy, patients with daytime ambulatory blood pressure of at least 135/85 mm Hg were randomly assigned (1:1) by computer (stratified by centres) to ultrasound renal denervation or a sham procedure. Patients and outcome assessors were masked to randomisation. Addition of antihypertensive medications was allowed if specified blood pressure thresholds were exceeded. The primary endpoint was the change in daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure at 2 months in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was also assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, {NCT}02649426. Findings: Between March 11, 2016, and March 13, 2020, 989 participants were enrolled and 136 were randomly assigned to renal denervation (n=69) or a sham procedure (n=67). Full adherence to the combination medications at 2 months among patients with urine samples was similar in both groups (42 [82\%] of 51 in the renal denervation group vs 47 [82\%] of 57 in the sham procedure group; p=0·99). Renal denervation reduced daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure more than the sham procedure (−8·0 mm Hg [{IQR} –16·4 to 0·0] vs –3·0 mm Hg [–10·3 to 1·8]; median between-group difference –4·5 mm Hg [95\% {CI} –8·5 to –0·3]; adjusted p=0·022); the median between-group difference was –5·8 mm Hg (95\% {CI} –9·7 to –1·6; adjusted p=0·0051) among patients with complete ambulatory blood pressure data. There were no differences in safety outcomes between the two groups. Interpretation: Compared with a sham procedure, ultrasound renal denervation reduced blood pressure at 2 months in patients with hypertension resistant to a standardised triple combination pill. If the blood pressure lowering effect and safety of renal denervation are maintained in the long term, renal denervation might be an alternative to the addition of further antihypertensive medications in patients with resistant hypertension.

	abstract = {Recent evidence indicates a link between gut pathology and microbiome with hypertension ({HTN}) in animal models. However, whether this association exists in humans is unknown. Thus, our objectives in the present study were to test the hypotheses that high blood pressure ({BP}) patients have distinct gut microbiomes and that gut-epithelial barrier function markers and microbiome composition could predict systolic {BP} ({SBP}). Fecal samples, analyzed by shotgun metagenomics, displayed taxonomic and functional changes, including altered butyrate production between patients with high {BP} and reference subjects. Significant increases in plasma of intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-{FABP}), lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}), and augmented gut-targetting proinflammatory T helper 17 (Th17) cells in high {BP} patients demonstrated increased intestinal inflammation and permeability. Zonulin, a gut epithelial tight junction protein regulator, was markedly elevated, further supporting gut barrier dysfunction in high {BP}. Zonulin strongly correlated with {SBP} (R 2 = 0.5301, P {\textless} 0.0001). Two models predicting {SBP} were built using stepwise linear regression analysis of microbiome data and circulating markers of gut health, and validated in a separate cohort by prediction of {SBP} from zonulin in plasma (R 2 = 0.4608, P {\textless} 0.0001). The mouse model of {HTN}, chronic angiotensin {II} (Ang {II}) infusion, was used to confirm the effects of butyrate and gut barrier function on the cardiovascular system and {BP}. These results support our conclusion that intestinal barrier dysfunction and microbiome function are linked to {HTN} in humans. They suggest that manipulation of gut microbiome and its barrier functions could be the new therapeutic and diagnostic avenues for {HTN}.},

	abstract = {The detrimental effects of a high-salt diet on human health have received much attention in the past few years. While it has been well established that high dietary salt intake is related to cardiovascular diseases, there is growing evidence that excess salt also affects the immune system and might be considered as a risk factor in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis ({MS}). Several studies have implicated T helper 17 cells (Th17) in the pathogenesis of {MS}. We and others recently demonstrated that excessive salt enhances the differentiation of Th17 cells, inducing a highly pathogenic phenotype that aggravates experimental neuroinflammation. Moreover, a diet rich in sodium affects intestinal microbiota alongside increased intestinal Th17 cells, thus linking the detrimental effects of high salt consumption to the gut-immune axis. First human studies revealed an association of increased {MS} disease activity with elevated sodium chloride consumption, while more recent epidemiology studies in larger cohorts suggest no correlation between salt intake and {MS}. However, it is known that ordinary urinary sodium analyses and nutritional questionnaires do not necessarily correspond to the actual sodium load and more sophisticated analyses are needed. Moreover, studies revealed that sodium can temporarily be stored in the body. This review summarizes recent findings on the impact of salt on the immune system and discusses potential challenges investigating dietary salt intake as a risk factor in {MS}.},

	abstract = {Aim: Gut microbiota-derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids ({SCFAs}) have vasodilator properties in animal and human ex vivo arteries. However, the role of the gut microbiota and {SCFAs} in arterial stiffness in humans is still unclear. Here we aimed to determine associations between the gut microbiome, {SCFA} and their G-protein coupled sensing receptors ({GPCRs}) in relation to human arterial stiffness. Methods: Ambulatory arterial stiffness index ({AASI}) was determined from ambulatory blood pressure ({BP}) monitoring in 69 participants from regional and metropolitan regions in Australia (55.1\% women; mean, 59.8± {SD}, 7.26 years of age). The gut microbiome was determined by 16S {rRNA} sequencing, {SCFA} levels by gas chromatography, and {GPCR} expression in circulating immune cells by real-time {PCR}. Results: There was no association between metrics of bacterial α and β diversity and {AASI} or {AASI} quartiles in men and women. We identified two main bacteria taxa that were associated with {AASI} quartiles: Lactobacillus spp. was only present in the lowest quartile, while Clostridium spp. was present in all quartiles but the lowest. {AASI} was positively associated with higher levels of plasma, but not faecal, butyrate. Finally, we identified that the expression of {GPR}43 ({FFAR}2) and {GPR}41 ({FFAR}3) in circulating immune cells were negatively associated with {AASI}. Conclusions: Our results suggest that arterial stiffness is associated with lower levels of the metabolite-sensing receptors {GPR}41/{GPR}43 in humans, blunting its response to {BP}-lowering metabolites such as butyrate. The role of Lactobacillus spp. and Clostridium spp., as well as butyrate-sensing receptors {GPR}41/{GPR}43, in human arterial stiffness needs to be determined.},

Both genetic and environmental factors (infections, stress, diet) are involved in the development of {IBD}. As we know that bacteria are found in the intestinal mucosa of human and clinical observations revealed bacterial biofilms associated with patients of {IBD}. Various factors and microbes are found to play an essential role in biofilm formation and mucosal colonization during {IBD}. Biofilm formation in the digestive tract is dependent on an extracellular matrix synthesized by the bacteria and it has an adverse effect on the immune response of the host. There is no satisfactory and safe treatment option for {IBD}. Therefore, the current research aims to disrupt biofilm in {IBD} and concentrates predominantly on improving the drug. Here, we review the literature on bacterial biofilm and {IBD} to gather new knowledge on the current understanding of biofilm formation in {IBD}, host immune deregulation and dysbiosis in {IBD}, molecular mechanism, bacteria involved in biofilm formation, current and future regimen. It is urgently required to plan new ways to control and eradicate bacteria in biofilms that will open up novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues for {IBD}.

	abstract = {Backgrounds and Aims: {APECED} is a rare autoimmune disease caused by mutations in the Autoimmune Regulator gene. A significant proportion of patients also have gastrointestinal symptoms, including malabsorption, chronic diarrhea, and obstipation. The pathological background of the gastrointestinal symptoms remains incompletely understood and involves multiple factors, with autoimmunity being the most common underlying cause. Patients with {APECED} have increased immune responses against gut commensals. Our objective was to evaluate whether the intestinal microbiota composition, predicted functions or fungal abundance differ between Finnish patients with {APECED} and healthy controls, and whether these associate to the patients’ clinical phenotype and gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods: {DNA} was isolated from fecal samples from 15 patients with {APECED} (median age 46.4 years) together with 15 samples from body mass index matched healthy controls. {DNA} samples were subjected to analysis of the gut microbiota using 16S {rRNA} gene amplicon sequencing, imputed metagenomics using the {PICRUSt}2 algorithm, and quantitative {PCR} for fungi. Extensive correlations of the microbiota with patient characteristics were determined. Results: Analysis of gut microbiota indicated that both alpha- and beta-diversity were altered in patients with {APECED} compared to healthy controls. The fraction of Faecalibacterium was reduced in patients with {APECED} while that of Atopobium spp. and several gram-negative genera previously implicated in biofilm formation, e.g. Veillonella, Prevotella, Megasphaera and Heamophilus, were increased in parallel to lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) synthesis in imputed metagenomics. The differences in gut microbiota were linked to patient characteristics, especially the presence of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies ({ASCA}) and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusions: Gut microbiota of patients with {APECED} is altered and enriched with predominantly gram-negative bacterial taxa that may promote biofilm formation and lead to increased exposure to {LPS} in the patients. The most pronounced alterations in the microbiota were associated with more severe gastrointestinal symptoms.},

It has been reported that the composition of human gut microbiota is changed during the progression of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. The current study aimed to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the composition of gut microbiota between patients with hypertension and healthy controls. Fecal samples were collected from 50 patients diagnosed with grade 3 hypertension and 30 healthy controls. Touchdown {PCR}-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis with primers specifically targeting the V3 region of 16S ribosomal {RNA}, and quantitative {PCR}, were performed to characterize all the samples. High-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 regions was performed on 30 randomly selected samples. By comparing diversity and richness indices, the gut microbiome of the hypertensive individuals was {foUnd} to be more diverse than that of the healthy controls. Among the main bacterial phlya that reside in the gut, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were dominant in all the samples; however the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio was variable, with a significant increase in the patients with hypertension compared with the healthy control group. In addition, at the genus level, there was an increased {abUndance} of Prevotella\_9, Megasphaera, Parasutterella and Escherichia-Shigella in patients with hypertension, while Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium were decreased. These results suggested that the human gut microbiota is altered in hypertension, and Understanding the mechanism of these changes in microbial composition may open up new insights, and help to treat hypertension and other related diseases.},

In their Review, Marques and co-workers describe how the gut microbiota and its metabolites act on downstream cellular targets to influence the pathogenesis of hypertension. Novel strategies to modify the gut microbiota might present a new therapeutic avenue to improve health and prevent disease. Hypertension is the leading risk factor for heart disease and stroke, and is estimated to cause 9.4 million deaths globally every year. The pathogenesis of hypertension is complex, but lifestyle factors such as diet are important contributors to the disease. High dietary intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with reduced blood pressure and lower cardiovascular mortality. A critical relationship between dietary intake and the composition of the gut microbiota has been described in the literature, and a growing body of evidence supports the role of the gut microbiota in the regulation of blood pressure. In this Review, we describe the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota and its metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine N-oxide, and lipopolysaccharides, act on downstream cellular targets to prevent or contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. These effects have a direct influence on tissues such as the kidney, the endothelium, and the heart. Finally, we consider the role of the gut microbiota in resistant hypertension, the possible intergenerational effect of the gut microbiota on blood pressure regulation, and the promising therapeutic potential of gut microbiota modification to improve health and prevent disease.},

	abstract = {E ssential hypertension is a complex trait, traditionally considered to have a medium genetic component that interacts with environmental risk factors such as diet. Of all of the common complex polygenetic traits that afflict humans, unraveling the genetic basis of essential hypertension has proven to be the most challenging. The latest genome-wide association study in a large cohort from the {UK} Biobank identified {\textgreater}100 single genetic variants linked to blood pressure ({BP}) that doubled the risk for the development of hypertension. 1 Each variant, however, had a small contribution to {BP} ({\textless}1 mm Hg). Even combined, these variants explained only a small proportion (9.3 mm Hg) of the interindividual variation in sys-tolic {BP}. 1 So where is the missing inherited component of essential hypertension? A recent body of evidence supports that the gut microbiota are associated with the development of hypertension in experimental and human hypertension (re-viewed in Ref 2). Subjects with untreated hypertension, for example, have a different gut microbiota composition, and when their fecal material was transplanted into mice without any microorganisms (ie, gnotobiotic), these mice developed higher {BP} compared with mice that received a fecal transplant from a normotensive subject. Moreover, the gut microbiota are essential for the development of experimental hypertension: gnotobiotic mice have a blunted response to angiotensin {II}. The most studied genetic model of hypertension, the spontaneously hypertensive rat, also has a different gut microbiota to its sister control strain, the Wistar Kyoto rat. In addition, systolic {BP} increased when antibiotic-treated Wistar Kyoto rats received a fecal transplant from a stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat. Our own studies support the existence of communication among the gut, the kidney, and the heart, whereas others have shown that the gut interacts directly with the central sympathetic nervous system in both spontaneously hypertensive rat and angiotensin {II} models. Therapies that target gut dysbiosis, including the use of fiber and the gut metabolite acetate, decrease {BP} and improve cardiovascular health. Together these studies support that the gut microbiota are an important, but so far poorly acknowledged, component of the development of hypertension. Although the exact mechanisms are still being determined, a plausible hypothesis is that gut microbes modulate numerous cells of the immune system and could be involved in the exaggerated inflammatory responses known to play a role in {BP} regulation. The exact moment when the first microbial colonization to the human body takes place is still to be unraveled. Some believe that the human fetus has a (minor) colonization while it is still in utero, whereas the most traditional line of thought supports the fetus is sterile until birth. Undoubtedly, during birth, the newborn is exposed to a wide variety of microbes from the environment but especially from the mother during a vaginal delivery. The newborn will also acquire new microbes (and their metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids) through breastfeeding and contact with relevant others such as the father. Although the long-term effects 1382 of this early colonization on health are not yet understood , the individual human gut microbiota is thought to be mostly (60\%) stable over a period of at least 5 years and, potentially, for decades. 3 Not only that, but the gut microbiome of monozygotic twins is more similar than that of dizygotic twins, and several taxa were recently shown to be heritable. These taxa were also found to be particularly stable over {\textgreater}3 years, suggesting that the environment might have a smaller effect on their abundance than previously believed (reviewed in Ref 3). It is important to note that these taxa are mostly abundant in disease states, and some are present at higher rates in subjects with hypertension. The relevance of these findings to essential hyper-tension is that we might have been approaching the inherited origins of hypertension the wrong way (Fig-ure). Perhaps the human genome on its own is not as important in the development of hypertension as we were led to believe. Instead, other components such as the human epigenome and the microbiome, which is also transmitted from parents and can be (at least partially) inherited, might have a bigger role than we previously thought. It is possible that the microbiota acquired early in life have a long-lasting founder effect, potentially predisposing us to develop essential hyper-tension as we age. In support of this hypothesis, studies that determined maternal contribution to essential hy-pertension, previously attributed to mitochondrial {DNA} mutations, found that a large percentage ({\textgreater}35\%) of the pedigrees with hypertension were because of maternal inheritance. 4 This included a longitudinal analysis of 6421 subjects from 1593 family pedigrees from the Framingham Heart study. 4 Moreover, maternal history of hypertension has been associated with greater lifetime risk of having hypertension than paternal history. 5},

We aimed to make an initial assessment of anticoagulation satisfaction before and after an extended-interval warfarin monitoring intervention. We conducted a translational prospective single-arm pilot study of extended-interval warfarin monitoring in five pharmacist-managed anticoagulation clinics. Patients meeting {CHEST} guideline criteria for extended-interval warfarin monitoring began progressive extended-interval follow-up (6, 8, and 12 weeks thereafter). The Duke Anticoagulation Satisfaction Scale ({DASS}) was administered at baseline and at end-of-study or study removal (in patients no longer appropriate for extended interval follow-up). Forty-six patients had evaluable pre- and post-intervention {DASS} survey data. Mean age of patients was 66.5 years, 74 \% were non-Hispanic whites, and 48 \% were men. Patients completed a mean ± {SD} of 34 ± 22 weeks of follow-up. Mean ± {SD} total {DASS} score at baseline was 45.2 ± 14.2 versus 49.1 ± 14.9 at end-of-study (mean change, +3.9 [95 \% {CI} −0.6–8.4; p = 0.09]), indicating no benefit—and trending toward decrement—to anticoagulation satisfaction. Change in anticoagulation satisfaction varied substantially following extended-interval monitoring, with no evidence of improved satisfaction. Plausible reasons for patients not preferring extended-interval monitoring include increased anxiety and disengagement from self-management activities, both potentially related to less frequent feedback and reassurance during extended interval-monitoring. Additional research is needed to identify who is likely to benefit most from extended-interval monitoring. Anticoagulation satisfaction should be considered with clinical factors and shared-decision making when implementing extended-interval warfarin monitoring.},

We included adults, aged 18-65 years, with a hypertension diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 401) and ≥1 antihypertensive medication fill. Two hypertension cohorts were examined-new antihypertensive drug users (incident hypertension) and patients requiring titration to a fourth antihypertensive (incident treatment-resistant hypertension [{TRH}]). Patient-level exposure to {BP}-interfering medications was assessed 6 months before and after the index date, defined as the first prescription fill of an antihypertensive drug or the first occurrence of overlapping use of ≥4 antihypertensive drugs. {RESULTS} We identified 521,028 patients with incident hypertension and 131,764 patients with incident {TRH}. The most prevalent {BP}-interfering prescription medications were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ({NSAIDs}), acetamin-ophens, and hormones. Overall, 18.3\% of the incident hypertension cohort and 17.6\% of the incident {TRH} cohort initiated a {BP}-interfering medication following antihypertensive titration. Among patients previously taking a {BP}-interfering medication, 57.6\% with incident hypertension and 64.9\% with incident {TRH} refilled that medication after antihypertensive intensification. {CONCLUSIONS} The use of prescription {BP}-interfering medications, especially {NSAIDs}, is prevalent among patients requiring intensification of their antihypertensive regimen. Greater efforts to limit the use of these medications, where feasible, may be required among patients with uncontrolled hypertension.},

Data collected during the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994), for persons 17 years and older were analyzed (n=20 050). During the household interview, respondents reported use, in the last month, of prescription and non-prescription analgesics. Results. An estimated 147 million adults reported monthly analgesic use, Prescription analgesic use was 9\% while non-prescription use was 76\%. Females were more likely than males to use prescription (11 vs. 7\%, p {\textless} 0.001) and non-prescription (81 vs. 71\%, p {\textless} 0.001) analgesics. Across race-ethnicity groups, males (∼8\%) and females (11-13\%) had similar age-adjusted prescription analgesic use. Non-prescription analgesic use was higher among non-Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans for males (76 vs. 53\% (p {\textless} 0.001) and 59\% (p {\textless} 0.001), respectively) and females (85 vs. 68\% (p {\textless} 0.001) and 71\% (p {\textless} 0.001), respectively). With increasing age, prescription analgesic use increased whereas non-prescription use decreased. Approximately 30\% of adults used multiple analgesics during a 1-month period. This was more common among females (35\%) than males (25\%, p {\textless} 0.001) and among younger (17-44 years, 33\%) rather than older age groups (45+ years, 26\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions. Analgesic use among {US} adults is extremely high, specifically of non-prescription analgesics. Given this, health care providers and consumers should be aware of potential adverse effects and monitor use closely. Published in 2002 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

published its first statement on the primary prevention of hypertension in
1993. This article updates the 1993 report, using new and further evidence
from the scientific literature. Current recommendations for primary prevention
of hypertension involve a population-based approach and an intensive targeted
strategy focused on individuals at high risk for hypertension. These 2 strategies
are complementary and emphasize 6 approaches with proven efficacy for prevention
of hypertension: engage in moderate physical activity; maintain normal body
weight; limit alcohol consumption; reduce sodium intake; maintain adequate
intake of potassium; and consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat
dairy products and reduced in saturated and total fat. Applying these approaches
to the general population as a component of public health and clinical practice
can help prevent blood pressure from increasing and can help decrease elevated
blood pressure levels for those with high normal blood pressure or hypertension.},

There are no randomized trials or studies using verified prescription data of this relationship. We aimed to assess the relationship between verified acetaminophen prescription data and risk of myocardial infarction or stroke in patients with hypertension. We performed a retrospective data analysis using information contained within the {UK} Clinical Research Practice Datalink. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios for myocardial infarction (primary end point), stroke, and any cardiovascular event (secondary end points) associated with acetaminophen use during a 10-year period. Acetaminophen exposure was a time-dependent variable. A propensity-matched design was also used to reduce potential for confounding. We included 24 496 hypertensive individuals aged ≥65 years. Of these, 10 878 were acetaminophen-exposed and 13 618 were not. There was no relationship between risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or any cardiovascular event and acetaminophen exposure on adjusted analysis (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95\% confidence interval, 0.76-1.27; hazard ratio, 1.09; 95\% confidence interval, 0.86-1.38; and hazard ratio, 1.17; 95\% confidence interval, 0.99-1.37; respectively). Results in the propensity-matched sample (n=4000 per group) and when men and women were analyzed separately were similar. High-frequency users (defined as receiving a prescription for {\textgreater}75\% of months) were also not at increased risk. After allowance for potentially confounding variables, the use of acetaminophen was not associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke in a large cohort of hypertensive patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Because traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are associated with increased risk for acute cardiovascular events, current guidelines recommend acetaminophen as the first-line analgesic of choice on the assumption of its greater cardiovascular safety. Data from randomized clinical trials prospectively addressing cardiovascular safety of acetaminophen, however, are still lacking, particularly in patients at increased cardiovascular risk. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of acetaminophen in patients with coronary artery disease. Methods and Results: The 33 patients with coronary artery disease included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study received acetaminophen (1 g {TID}) on top of standard cardiovascular therapy for 2 weeks. Ambulatory blood pressure, heart rate, endothelium-dependent and-independent vasodilatation, platelet function, endothelial progenitor cells, markers of the renin-angiotensin system, inflammation, and oxidative stress were determined at baseline and after each treatment period. Treatment with acetaminophen resulted in a significant increase in mean systolic (from 122.4±11.9 to 125.3±12.0 mm Hg P=0.02 versus placebo) and diastolic (from 73.2±6.9 to 75.4±7.9 mm Hg P=0.02 versus placebo) ambulatory blood pressures. On the other hand, heart rate, endothelial function, early endothelial progenitor cells, and platelet function did not change. Conclusions: This study demonstrates for the first time that acetaminophen induces a significant increase in ambulatory blood pressure in patients with coronary artery disease. Thus, the use of acetaminophen should be evaluated as rigorously as traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, particularly in patients at increased cardiovascular risk.

	abstract = {Background - Although randomized trials of cyclooxygenase-2 ({COX}-2) inhibitors have shown increased cardiovascular risk, studies of nonselective, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ({NS} {AIDs}) and acetaminophen have been inconsistent. Methods and Results - We examined the influence of {NSAIDs} and acetaminophen on the risk of major cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal and fatal stroke) in a prospective cohort of 70 971 women, aged 44 to 69 years at baseline, free of known cardiovascular disease or cancer, who provided medication data biennially since 1990. During 12 years of follow-up, we confirmed 2041 major cardiovascular events. Women who reported occasional (1 to 21 d/mo) use of {NSAIDs} or acetaminophen did not experience a significant increase in the risk of cardiovascular events. However, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, women who frequently (≥22 d/mo) used {NSAIDs} had a relative risk ({RR}) for a cardiovascular event of 1.44 (95\% {CI}, 1.27 to 1.65) compared with nonusers, whereas those who frequently consumed acetaminophen had a {RR} of 1.35 (95\% {CI}, 1.14 to 1.59). The elevated risk associated with frequent {NSAID} use was particularly evident among current smokers ({RR}=1.82; 95\% {CI}, 1.38 to 2.42) and was absent among never smokers (P interaction=0.02). Moreover, we observed significant dose-response relations: Compared with nonusers, the {RRs} for a cardiovascular event among women who used ≥15 tablets per week were 1.86 (95\% {CI}, 1.27 to 2.73) for {NSAIDs} and 1.68 (95\% {CI}, 1.10 to 2.58) for acetaminophen. Conclusions - Use of {NSAIDs} or acetaminophen at high frequency or dose is associated with a significantly increased risk for major cardiovascular events, although more moderate use did not confer substantial risk. © 2006 American Heart Association, Inc.},

	abstract = {Observational databases are often used to study causal questions. Before being granted access to data or funding, researchers may need to prove that “the statistical power of their analysis will be high.” Analyses expected to have low power, and hence result in imprecise estimates, will not be approved. This restrictive attitude towards observational analyses is misguided. A key misunderstanding is the belief that the goal of a causal analysis is to “detect” an effect. Causal effects are not binary signals that are either detected or undetected; causal effects are numerical quantities that need to be estimated. Because the goal is to quantify the effect as unbiasedly and precisely as possible, the solution to observational analyses with imprecise effect estimates is not avoiding observational analyses with imprecise estimates, but rather encouraging the conduct of many observational analyses. It is preferable to have multiple studies with imprecise estimates than having no study at all. After several studies become available, we will meta-analyze them and provide a more precise pooled effect estimate. Therefore, the justification to withhold an observational analysis of preexisting data cannot be that our estimates will be imprecise. Ethical arguments for power calculations before conducting a randomized trial which place individuals at risk are not transferable to observational analyses of existing databases. If a causal question is important, analyze your data, publish your estimates, encourage others to do the same, and then meta-analyze. The alternative is an unanswered question.},

Some agents cause either sodium retention or extracellular volume expansion, or activate directly or indirectly the sympathetic nervous system. Other substances act directly on arteriolar smooth muscle or do not have a defined mechanism of action. Some medications that usually lower blood pressure may paradoxically increase blood pressure, or an increase in pressure may be encountered after their discontinuation. In general, drug-induced pressure increases are small and transient: however, severe hypertension involving encephalopathy, stroke, and irreversible renal failure have been reported. The deleterious effect of therapeutic agents is more pronounced in patients with preexisting hypertension, in those with renal failure, and in the elderly. Careful evaluation of a patient's drug regimen may identify chemically induced hypertension and obviate unnecessary evaluation and facilitate antihypertensive therapy. Once chemical-induced hypertension has been identified, discontinuation of the causative agent is recommended, although hypertension can often be managed by specific therapy and dose adjustment if continued use of the offending agent is mandatory.

Fortunately, in recent years, the drug development process has generally discouraged the approval and marketing of antihypertensive drugs with this problem, although some anomalies still exist (eg, telmisartan + digoxin). Physicians who work in emergency departments are more familiar with illicit or unregulated drugs that affect blood pressure; chief among these are cocaine and other opioids, and methylphenidate and its congeners. The most important prescription drugs that affect blood pressure are the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including selective inhibitors of the second isoform of cyclooxygenase) and steroids. Phenylpropanolamines, some antidepressants, and sibutramine can often be avoided, as they raise blood pressure in a significant proportion of those who take them. Conversely, the hypertensive effects of calcineurin inhibitors and erythropoietin are most commonly overcome by increasing the intensity of antihypertensive drug treatment, since these drugs are essentially unavoidable in most patients who receive them.},

Some drugs are associated with high sodium intake (in particular effervescent tablets), but the cardiovascular risk associated with such high sodium-containing drugs ({HSCD}) is largely underevaluated.   Objectives To summarize the evidence for a potential cardiovascular risk associated with exposure to {HSCD}, and to highlight possible risk factors associated with this iatrogenic issue; in general and/or specific populations.   Methods We conducted a systematic review, by searching electronic databases including {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, Web of Science, {CENTRAL} and grey literature between 1960 and 2015. We included studies that reported modification of cardiovascular parameters or incidence/prevalence of cardiovascular outcomes, between a group of subjects exposed to {HSCD} relative to a non-exposed group. The threshold used to identify {HSCD} was 391 mg/day. We did not consider studies evaluating exposure to sodium as an active ingredient or those focusing on dialysis solutions or enteral/parenteral nutrition. Study quality was assessed using the {EPHPP} tool.   Results A total of eight studies met our inclusion criteria. Four reported results for short-term exposure to {HSCD} (≤ 7 days) on {BP} fluctuations. One study reported an elevation of {BP} (associated sodium intake: 1,656 mg/day). Four studies evaluated a long-term exposure (≥ 2 years or discontinuation of a chronic treatment). Two studies reported iatrogenic risk. For these studies, drug associated sodium intake was high ({\textgreater} 1,500 mg/day) in patients with comorbidities (in particular, diabetes mellitus and hypertension).   Conclusion Despite numerous study limitations, this systematic review suggests three potential synergistic risk factors for cardiovascular complications after exposure to {HSCD}: a high sodium intake (≥ 1,500 mg/day), a long duration of exposure, and the presence of comorbidities. Further studies are required to characterize this iatrogenic risk.   Trial registration {PROSPERO} {CRD}42016047086.},

We aimed to measure the prevalence of hypertension and progress in its detection, treatment, and control from 1990 to 2019 for 200 countries and territories. Methods: We used data from 1990 to 2019 on people aged 30–79 years from population-representative studies with measurement of blood pressure and data on blood pressure treatment. We defined hypertension as having systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater, diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater, or taking medication for hypertension. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the prevalence of hypertension and the proportion of people with hypertension who had a previous diagnosis (detection), who were taking medication for hypertension (treatment), and whose hypertension was controlled to below 140/90 mm Hg (control). The model allowed for trends over time to be non-linear and to vary by age. Findings: The number of people aged 30–79 years with hypertension doubled from 1990 to 2019, from 331 (95\% credible interval 306–359) million women and 317 (292–344) million men in 1990 to 626 (584–668) million women and 652 (604–698) million men in 2019, despite stable global age-standardised prevalence. In 2019, age-standardised hypertension prevalence was lowest in Canada and Peru for both men and women; in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and some countries in western Europe including Switzerland, Spain, and the {UK} for women; and in several low-income and middle-income countries such as Eritrea, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Solomon Islands for men. Hypertension prevalence surpassed 50\% for women in two countries and men in nine countries, in central and eastern Europe, central Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. Globally, 59\% (55–62) of women and 49\% (46–52) of men with hypertension reported a previous diagnosis of hypertension in 2019, and 47\% (43–51) of women and 38\% (35–41) of men were treated. Control rates among people with hypertension in 2019 were 23\% (20–27) for women and 18\% (16–21) for men. In 2019, treatment and control rates were highest in South Korea, Canada, and Iceland (treatment {\textgreater}70\%; control {\textgreater}50\%), followed by the {USA}, Costa Rica, Germany, Portugal, and Taiwan. Treatment rates were less than 25\% for women and less than 20\% for men in Nepal, Indonesia, and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Control rates were below 10\% for women and men in these countries and for men in some countries in north Africa, central and south Asia, and eastern Europe. Treatment and control rates have improved in most countries since 1990, but we found little change in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Improvements were largest in high-income countries, central Europe, and some upper-middle-income and recently high-income countries including Costa Rica, Taiwan, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, and Iran. Interpretation: Improvements in the detection, treatment, and control of hypertension have varied substantially across countries, with some middle-income countries now outperforming most high-income nations. The dual approach of reducing hypertension prevalence through primary prevention and enhancing its treatment and control is achievable not only in high-income countries but also in low-income and middle-income settings.

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: This review is intended to briefly describe the primary mechanistic pathways by which several common drugs can increase blood pressure. We also propose potential management strategies based on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the blood pressure elevation. Recent Findings: As hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events, healthcare providers must evaluate patients’ concomitant medications that may contribute to elevations in blood pressure. The presence of these medications, if not properly addressed, can lead to consequences such as an inadvertent diagnosis of hypertension, as well as the potential need for unnecessary intensification of antihypertensive regimens in those already treated. Summary: Blood pressure elevation is an unfortunate by-product of multiple medications. The substances discussed in this review can elicit significant and persistent elevations in blood pressure, and health care providers must first evaluate whether the drug is necessary. If one exists, it is best to select a similar agent with lower risk of increasing blood pressure; if unavoidable, then clinicians should select an appropriate management strategy to compensate for the rise in blood pressure.},

	abstract = {Several drugs can cause hypertension and/or blunt the effect of antihypertensive treatment. They can exacerbate a previously well controlled hypertension and/or render it resistant to therapy. Accordingly, drugs represent a common cause of resistance of hypertension to treatment. Identification of drug-related hypertension can be achieved with a thorough medical history targeted to ascertain concurrent therapies that are prescribed for conditions other than cardiovascular diseases. This can avoid prescribing a more aggressive antihypertensive treatment and may prevent embarking in costly and sometimes invasive diagnostic procedures. Drugs that commonly raise blood pressure include {NSAIDs}, steroids, oestroprogestinic agents, immunosuppressants, erythropoietin, inhibitors of angiogenesis, anti-{HIV} agents, and also some high-density lipoprotein-raising agents. As withdrawal of the offending drug is often impracticable, knowledge of the mechanism(s) by which each drug exerts its pressor effects may help selecting the most effective treatment. Purpose of this review is to examine the most common causes of resistant hypertension that are due to drugs or abuse of substances along with their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The strategy for selecting the most appropriate treatment and the reasons for 'a call of action' of research in this area are also examined. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health {\textbar} Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.},

	abstract = {There is no doubt that patients with high blood pressure ({BP}) are at higher cardiovascular and death risk than those subjects whose {BP} levels are below the admitted normal threshold. However, most of the epidemiological surveys show that {BP} is uncontrolled in more than fifty percent of hypertensive subjects. There are several reasons that can justify this lack of hypertension control, some of them depending on the patient, such as therapeutic adherence, or some related to the doctor, due to therapeutic inertia or reluctance to increment the number and doses of antihypertensive drugs. Sometimes the efficacy or adverse effects related to the antihypertensive drugs underlie the uncontrolled hypertension. And, finally, there are some clinical conditions that are associated with difficult-to-control hypertension. Among them, comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome or chronic kidney disease, but also drug-related hypertension or resistant hypertension. In this article we review the epidemiology and the conditions which are related to poorly controlled hypertension and that can explain why hypertension may become difficult-to-treat. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health {\textbar} Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Multiple imputation for non‐response replaces each missing value by two or more plausible values. The values can be chosen to represent both uncertainty about the reasons for non‐response and uncertainty about which values to impute assuming the reasons for non‐response are known. This paper provides an overview of methods for creating and analysing multiply‐imputed data sets, and illustrates the dramatic improvements possible when using multiple rather than single imputation. A major application of multiple imputation to public‐use files from the 1970 census is discussed, and several exploratory studies related to health care that have used multiple imputation are described.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}African Americans have a higher risk of hypertension compared with other racial or ethnic groups in the United States. One possible explanation for this disparity is discrimination. Few studies have examined the association between discrimination and incidence of hypertension. We examined whether everyday discrimination, lifetime discrimination, and stress from discrimination were associated with incident hypertension and whether these associations differed by gender, age, discrimination attribution, and coping responses to discrimination among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study. Discrimination was self-reported by 1845 African Americans aged 21 to 85 years without hypertension at baseline (2000–2004). Participants completed 2 follow-up study visits from 2005 to 2008 and 2009 to 2013. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate associations of discrimination with incident hypertension. Overall, 52\% (n=954) of the participants developed hypertension over the follow-up period. After adjustment for age, gender, socioeconomic status and hypertension risk factors, medium versus low levels of lifetime discrimination (hazard ratio, 1.49 [95\% {CI}, 1.18–1.89]), and high versus low levels of lifetime discrimination (hazard ratio, 1.34 [95\% {CI}, 1.07–1.68]) were associated with a higher incidence of hypertension. No statistically significant interactions with gender, age, attribution, or coping were present. Higher stress from lifetime discrimination was associated with higher hypertension risk after adjustment for demographics (hazard ratio for high versus low, 1.19 [95\% {CI}, 1.01–1.40]), but the association was attenuated after adjustment for hypertension risk factors (hazard ratio, 1.14 [95\% {CI}, 0.97–1.35]). Lifetime discrimination may increase the risk of hypertension in African Americans.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Context: The long-term risk for developing hypertension is best described by the lifetime risk statistic. The lifetime risk for hypertension and trends in this risk over time are unknown. Objectives: To estimate the residual lifetime risk for hypertension in older {US} adults and to evaluate temporal trends in this risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: Community-based prospective cohort study of 1298 participants from the Framingham Heart Study who were aged 55 to 65 years and free of hypertension at baseline (1976-1998). Main Outcome Measures: Residual lifetime risk (lifetime cumulative incidence not adjusted for competing causes of mortality) for hypertension, defined as blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or greater or use of antihypertensive medications. Results: The residual lifetime risks for developing hypertension and stage 1 high blood pressure or higher (≥140/90 mm Hg regardless of treatment) were 90\% in both 55 and 65-year-old participants. The lifetime probability of receiving antihypertensive medication was 60\%. The risk for hypertension remained unchanged for women, but it was approximately 60\% higher for men in the contemporary 1976-1998 period compared with an earlier 1952-1975 period. In contrast, the residual lifetime risk for stage 2 high blood pressure or higher (≥160/100 mm Hg regardless of treatment) was considerably lower in both sexes in the recent period (35\%-57\% in 1952-1975 vs 35\%-44\% in 1976-1998), likely due to a marked increase in treatment of individuals with substantially elevated blood pressure. Conclusion: The residual lifetime risk for hypertension for middle-aged and elderly individuals is 90\%, indicating a huge public health burden. Although the decline in lifetime risk for stage 2 high blood pressure or higher represents a major achievement, efforts should be directed at the primary prevention of hypertension.},

Aldosterone synthase inhibitors ({ASIs}) are currently being investigated as a new therapeutic strategy to reduce aldosterone secretion from the adrenal gland. In this study, the efficacy and safety of the first-generation {ASI} {LCI}699 (0.25mg twice daily, 1mg 4 once daily, and 0.5mg/1mg twice daily) was compared with placebo and eplerenone (50mg twice daily), in patients with resistant hypertension. Placebo-adjusted decreases in systolic blood pressure ({BP}) with {LCI}699 ranged from 2.6mmHg to 4.3mmHg at week 8; changes in diastolic {BP} ranged from +0.3mmHg to -1.2mmHg. However, reductions were smaller than observed with eplerenone 50mg twice daily (9.9mmHg and 2.9mmHg for systolic and diastolic {BP}, respectively) and not statistically significant vs placebo. {LCI}699 suppressed plasma aldosterone levels in a dose-related manner with corresponding dose-dependent increases in plasma renin activity and plasma 11-deoxycorticosterone. {LCI}699 and eplerenone were well tolerated. These data demonstrate that aldosterone synthesis inhibition with {LCI}699 lowers {BP} modestly in patients with resistant hypertension. Aldosterone synthesis inhibition might offer an attractive adjunct to aldosterone receptor blockade, although the potential of a combination {MRA}/{ASI} has not yet been tested. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Global development goals increasingly rely on country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress. To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study ({GBD}) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. {GBD} 2017 provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2017. {METHODS} The causes of death database is composed of vital registration ({VR}), verbal autopsy ({VA}), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data. {GBD} 2017 added ten {VA} studies, 127 country-years of {VR} data, 502 cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance country-year. Expansions of the {GBD} cause of death hierarchy resulted in 18 additional causes estimated for {GBD} 2017. Newly available data led to subnational estimates for five additional countries-Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases ({ICD}) codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of death were reassigned to underlying causes by redistribution algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation. We used statistical modelling tools developed for {GBD}, including the Cause of Death Ensemble model ({CODEm}), to generate cause fractions and cause-specific death rates for each location, year, age, and sex. Instead of using {UN} estimates as in previous versions, {GBD} 2017 independently estimated population size and fertility rate for all locations. Years of life lost ({YLLs}) were then calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. All rates reported here are age-standardised. {FINDINGS} At the broadest grouping of causes of death (Level 1), non-communicable diseases ({NCDs}) comprised the greatest fraction of deaths, contributing to 73·4\% (95\% uncertainty interval [{UI}] 72·5-74·1) of total deaths in 2017, while communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional ({CMNN}) causes accounted for 18·6\% (17·9-19·6), and injuries 8·0\% (7·7-8·2). Total numbers of deaths from {NCD} causes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22·7\% (21·5-23·9), representing an additional 7·61 million (7·20-8·01) deaths estimated in 2017 versus 2007. The death rate from {NCDs} decreased globally by 7·9\% (7·0-8·8). The number of deaths for {CMNN} causes decreased by 22·2\% (20·0-24·0) and the death rate by 31·8\% (30·1-33·3). Total deaths from injuries increased by 2·3\% (0·5-4·0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from injuries decreased by 13·7\% (12·2-15·1) to 57·9 deaths (55·9-59·2) per 100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use disorders also increased, rising from 284 000 deaths (268 000-289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000 (334 000-363 000) in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total deaths from conflict and terrorism increased by 118·0\% (88·8-148·6). A greater reduction in total deaths and death rates was observed for some {CMNN} causes among children younger than 5 years than for older adults, such as a 36·4\% (32·2-40·6) reduction in deaths from lower respiratory infections for children younger than 5 years compared with a 33·6\% (31·2-36·1) increase in adults older than 70 years. Globally, the number of deaths was greater for men than for women at most ages in 2017, except at ages older than 85 years. Trends in global {YLLs} reflect an epidemiological transition, with decreases in total {YLLs} from enteric infections, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and maternal and neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these were generally greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the Socio-demographic Index ({SDI}). At the same time, there were large increases in {YLLs} from neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases. {YLL} rates decreased across the five leading Level 2 causes in all {SDI} quintiles. The leading causes of {YLLs} in 1990-neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal diseases-were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in 2017. Meanwhile, estimated {YLLs} increased for ischaemic heart disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even though {YLL} rates decreased. Population growth contributed to increased total deaths across the 20 leading Level 2 causes of mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific mortality rate reduced the effect of population growth for all but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases. {INTERPRETATION} Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease are expanding threats to global health. For causes of death such as lower respiratory and enteric infections, more rapid progress occurred for children than for the oldest adults, and there is continuing disparity in mortality rates by sex across age groups. Reductions in the death rate of some common diseases are themselves slowing or have ceased, primarily for {NCDs}, and the death rate for selected causes has increased in the past decade. {FUNDING} Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {METHODS}: Aldosterone is important in the pathophysiology of heart failure. In a doubleblind study, we enrolled 1663 patients who had severe heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35 percent and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily, and 841 to receive placebo. The primary end point was death from all causes. {RESULTS}: The trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46 percent) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35 percent; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P{\textless}0.001). This 30 percent reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35 percent lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P{\textless}0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P{\textless}0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10 percent of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P{\textless}0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients. {CONCLUSIONS}: Blockade of aldosterone receptors by spironolactone, in addition to standard therapy, substantially reduces the risk of both morbidity and death among patients with severe heart failure.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: It has recently been reported that the use of calcium-channel blockers for hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Because this issue remains controversial, we studied the incidence of such complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with either the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril as part of a larger study. {METHODS}: The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes ({ABCD}) Trial is a prospective, randomized, blinded trial comparing the effects of moderate control of blood pressure (target diastolic pressure, 80 to 89 mm Hg) with those of intensive control of blood pressure (diastolic pressure, 75 mm Hg) on the incidence and progression of complications of diabetes. The study also compared nisoldipine with enalapril as a first-line antihypertensive agent in terms of the prevention and progression of complications of diabetes. In the current study, we analyzed data on a secondary end point (the incidence of myocardial infarction) in the subgroup of patients in the {ABCD} Trial who had hypertension. {RESULTS}: Analysis of the 470 patients in the trial who had hypertension (base-line diastolic blood pressure, {\textgreater} or = 90 mm Hg) showed similar control of blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid concentrations, and smoking behavior in the nisoldipine group (237 patients) and the enalapril group (233 patients) throughout five years of follow-up. Using a multiple logistic-regression model with adjustment for cardiac risk factors, we found that nisoldipine was associated with a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (a total of 24) than enalapril (total, 4) (risk ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 33.8). {CONCLUSIONS}: In this population of patients with diabetes and hypertension, we found a significantly higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction among those assigned to therapy with the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine than among those assigned to receive enalapril. Since our findings are based on a secondary end point, they will require confirmation.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To compare the economic burden to society incurred by patients with {RA}, {OA}, or high blood pressure ({HBP}) in Ontario, Canada. {METHODS}: Consecutive subjects recruited by 52 rheumatologists ({RA}) and 76 family physicians ({OA} and {HBP}) were interviewed at baseline and 3 months. Information was collected on demographics, health status, and any comorbidities. A detailed, open ended resource utilisation questionnaire inquired about the use of medical and non-medical resources and patient and care giver losses of time and related expenses. Annual costs were derived as recommended by national costing guidelines and converted to American dollars (year 2000). Statistical comparisons were made using ordinary least squares regression on raw and log transformed costs, and generalised linear modelling with adjustment for age, sex, educational attainment, and presence of comorbidities. {RESULTS}: Baseline and 3 month interviews were completed by 253/292 (86.6\%) patients with {RA} and 473/585 (80.9\%) patients with {OA} and/or {HBP}. Baseline and total annual disease costs for {RA} (n = 253), {OA} and {HBP} (n = 191), {OA} (n = 140), and {HBP} (n = 142), respectively, were \$9300, \$4900, \$5700, and {US}\$3900. Indirect costs related to {RA} were up to five times higher than indirect costs incurred by patients with {OA} or {HBP}, or both. The presence of comorbidities was associated with disease costs for all diagnoses, cancelling out potential effects of age or sex. {CONCLUSION}: The economic burden incurred by {RA} significantly exceeds that related to {OA} and {HBP}, while differences between patients with a diagnosis of {OA} without {HBP} or a diagnosis of {HBP} alone were non-significant, largely owing to the influence of comorbidities.},

	abstract = {The Canadian Hypertension Education Program reviews the hypertension literature annually and provides detailed recommendations regarding hypertension diagnosis, assessment, prevention, and treatment. This report provides the updated evidence-based recommendations for 2015. This year, 4 new recommendations were added and 2 existing recommendations were modified. A revised algorithm for the diagnosis of hypertension is presented. Two major changes are proposed: (1) measurement using validated electronic (oscillometric) upper arm devices is preferred over auscultation for accurate office blood pressure measurement; (2) if the visit 1 mean blood pressure is increased but {\textless} 180/110 mm Hg, out-of-office blood pressure measurements using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (preferably) or home blood pressure monitoring should be performed before visit 2 to rule out white coat hypertension, for which pharmacologic treatment is not recommended. A standardized ambulatory blood pressure monitoring protocol and an update on automated office blood pressure are also presented. Several other recommendations on accurate measurement of blood pressure and criteria for diagnosis of hypertension have been reorganized. Two other new recommendations refer to smoking cessation: (1) tobacco use status should be updated regularly and advice to quit smoking should be provided; and (2) advice in combination with pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation should be offered to all smokers. The following recommendations were modified: (1) renal artery stenosis should be primarily managed medically; and (2) renal artery angioplasty and stenting could be considered for patients with renal artery stenosis and complicated, uncontrolled hypertension. The rationale for these recommendation changes is discussed.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Control of blood pressure is a key component of cardiovascular disease prevention, but is difficult to achieve and until recently has been the sole preserve of health professionals. This study assessed whether self-management by people with poorly controlled hypertension resulted in better blood pressure control compared with usual care. {METHODS}: This randomised controlled trial was undertaken in 24 general practices in the {UK}. Patients aged 35-85 years were eligible for enrolment if they had blood pressure more than 140/90 mm Hg despite antihypertensive treatment and were willing to self-manage their hypertension. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to self-management, consisting of self-monitoring of blood pressure and self-titration of antihypertensive drugs, combined with telemonitoring of home blood pressure measurements or to usual care. Randomisation was done by use of a central web-based system and was stratified by general practice with minimisation for sex, baseline systolic blood pressure, and presence or absence of diabetes or chronic kidney disease. Neither participants nor investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was change in mean systolic blood pressure between baseline and each follow-up point (6 months and 12 months). All randomised patients who attended follow-up visits at 6 months and 12 months and had complete data for the primary outcome were included in the analysis, without imputation for missing data. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number {ISRCTN}17585681. {FINDINGS}: 527 participants were randomly assigned to self-management (n=263) or control (n=264), of whom 480 (91\%; self-management, n=234; control, n=246) were included in the primary analysis. Mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 12.9 mm Hg (95\% {CI} 10.4-15.5) from baseline to 6 months in the self-management group and by 9.2 mm Hg (6.7-11.8) in the control group (difference between groups 3.7 mm Hg, 0.8-6.6; p=0.013). From baseline to 12 months, systolic blood pressure decreased by 17.6 mm Hg (14.9-20.3) in the self-management group and by 12.2 mm Hg (9.5-14.9) in the control group (difference between groups 5.4 mm Hg, 2.4-8.5; p=0.0004). Frequency of most side-effects did not differ between groups, apart from leg swelling (self-management, 74 patients [32\%]; control, 55 patients [22\%]; p=0.022). {INTERPRETATION}: Self-management of hypertension in combination with telemonitoring of blood pressure measurements represents an important new addition to control of hypertension in primary care. {FUNDING}: Department of Health Policy Research Programme, National Coordinating Centre for Research Capacity Development, and Midlands Research Practices Consortium.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Both renal denervation ({RDN}) and spironolactone have been proposed for the treatment of resistant hypertension. However, they have not been compared in a randomized clinical trial. We aimed to compare the efficacy of spironolactone versus {RDN} in patients with resistant hypertension. {METHODS}: A total of 24 patients with office {SBP} at least 150 {mmHg} and 24-h {SBP} at least 140 {mmHg} despite receiving at least three full-dose antihypertensive drugs, one a diuretic, but without aldosterone antagonists, were randomized to receive {RDN} or spironolactone (50 mg) as add-on therapy. Primary endpoint was change in 24-h {SBP} at 6 months. Comparisons between treatment groups were performed using generalized linear models adjusted by age, sex, and baseline values. {RESULTS}: Spironolactone was more effective than {RDN} in reducing 24-h {SBP} and 24-h {DBP}: mean baseline-adjusted differences between the two groups were -17.9 {mmHg} (95\%{CI} -30.9 to -4.9); P = 0.010 and -6.6 {mmHg} (95\%{CI} -12.9 to -0.3); P = 0.041, for 24-h {SBP} and 24-h {DBP}, respectively. As regards changes in office blood pressure, mean baseline-adjusted differences between the two groups were -12.1 {mmHg} (95\%{CI} -29.1 to 5.1); P = 0.158 and of -5.3 {mmHg} (95\%{CI} -16.3 to 5.8); P = 0.332, for office {SBP} and office {DBP}, respectively. Otherwise, the decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate was greater in the spironolactone group; mean baseline-adjusted difference between the two groups was -10.7 ml/min per 1.73 m (95\%{CI} -20.1 to -1.4); P = 0.027. {CONCLUSION}: We conclude that spironolactone is more effective than {RDN} to reduce 24-h {SBP} and 24-h {DBP} in patients with resistant hypertension. Therefore, spironolactone should be the fourth antihypertensive drug to prescribe if deemed well tolerated' in all patients with resistant hypertension before considering {RDN}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, considered fourth line therapy for hypertension in patients already treated with multiple medications. {OBJECTIVES}: Primary: to determine the effect of spironolactone on patient mortality, morbidity, and to quantify the magnitude of blood pressure lowering effect of spironolactone monotherapy.Secondary: to determine the prevalence of adverse reactions observed with spironolactone monotherapy and to determine if there is a blood-pressure lowering dose response with spironolactone. {SEARCH} {STRATEGY}: We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (3rd Quarter 2009), {MEDLINE} (2005 - Sept. 2009), and {EMBASE} (2007 - Sept. 2009). References from retrieved studies were reviewed to identify any studies missed in the initial search. No language restrictions were applied. {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: We selected {RCTs} studying patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary or gestational hypertension, and studies where patients were receiving multiple antihypertensives. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two reviewers independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. Data synthesis and analysis was performed using {RevMan} 5. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Meta-analysis of the 5 cross-over studies found a reduction in {SBP} of 20.09 {mmHg} (95\%{CI}:16.58-23.06,p{\textless}0.00001) and a 6.75 {mmHg} (95\%{CI}:4.8-8.69,p{\textless}0.00001) reduction in {DBP}. These results were statistically significant and there was no evidence of heterogeneity between the studies. There may be a dose response effect with spironolactone up to 50 mg/day, but the confidence intervals around the mean end-of-study blood pressure for doses ranging 25-500 mg/day all overlapped. In other words, it appears that doses {\textgreater}50mg/day do not produce further reductions in either {SBP} or {DBP}. One cross-over study found that spironolactone 25 mg/day did not statistically significantly change {SBP} or {DBP} compared to placebo, {SBP}: -9.9 (95\%{CI}:-21.15,1.35); {DBP} -2.34 (95\%{CI}:-7.92,3.06). {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: From the limited available evidence, spironolactone appears to lower blood pressure compared to placebo to a similar degree in patients with primary (essential) hypertension when doses of 100-500 mg/day are given. A dose of 25 mg/day did not statistically significantly reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure, compared to placebo. Given the lack of a dose-response, coupled with a possible increased risk in adverse events with higher doses, doses of 25 to 100 mg/day are reasonable. There is no evidence of the effect of spironolactone on clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients.},

The drug doses were titrated to a goal of less than 90 mm Hg for maximal diastolic pressure, and the patients continued to receive therapy for at least one year.{\textbar}The mean (+/- {SD}) age of the randomized patients was 59 +/- 10 years, and 48 percent were black. The average blood pressure at base line was 152 +/- 14/99 +/- 3 mm Hg. Diltiazem therapy had the highest rate of success: 59 percent of the treated patients had reached the blood-pressure goal at the end of the titration phase and had a diastolic blood pressure of less than 95 mm Hg at one year. Atenolol was successful by this definition in 51 percent of the patients, clonidine in 50 percent, hydrochlorothiazide in 46 percent, captopril in 42 percent, and prazosin in 42 percent; all these agents were superior to placebo (success rate, 25 percent).

For {SMBP} monitoring plus additional support versus usual care (25 comparisons), high-strength evidence supports a lower {BP} with use of {SMBP} monitoring, ranging from -3.4 to -8.9 mm Hg for systolic {BP} and from -1.9 to -4.4 mm Hg for diastolic {BP}, at 12 months in good-quality studies. For {SMBP} monitoring plus additional support versus {SMBP} monitoring alone or with less intense additional support (13 comparisons), low-strength evidence fails to support a difference.

	abstract = {Resistant hypertension is a common clinical problem faced by both primary care clinicians and specialists. While the exact prevalence of resistant hypertension is unknown, clinical trials suggest that it is not rare, involving perhaps 20\% to 30\% of study participants. As older age and obesity are 2 of the strongest risk factors for uncontrolled hypertension, the incidence of resistant hypertension will likely increase as the population becomes more elderly and heavier. The prognosis of resistant hypertension is unknown, but cardiovascular risk is undoubtedly increased as patients often have a history of long-standing, severe hypertension complicated by multiple other cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. The diagnosis of resistant hypertension requires use of good blood pressure technique to confirm persistently elevated blood pressure levels. Pseudoresistance, including lack of blood pressure control secondary to poor medication adherence or white coat hypertension, must be excluded. Resistant hypertension is almost always multifactorial in etiology. Successful treatment requires identification and reversal of lifestyle factors contributing to treatment resistance; diagnosis and appropriate treatment of secondary causes of hypertension; and use of effective multidrug regimens. As a subgroup, patients with resistant hypertension have not been widely studied. Observational assessments have allowed for identification of demographic and lifestyle characteristics associated with resistant hypertension, and the role of secondary causes of hypertension in promoting treatment resistance is well documented; however, identification of broader mechanisms of treatment resistance is lacking. In particular, attempts to elucidate potential genetic causes of resistant hypertension have been limited. Recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of resistant hypertension remain largely empiric due to the lack of systematic assessments of 3 or 4 drug combinations. Studies of resistant hypertension are limited by the high cardiovascular risk of patients within this subgroup, which generally precludes safe withdrawal of medications; the presence of multiple disease processes (eg, sleep apnea, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic disease) and their associated medical therapies, which confound interpretation of study results; and the difficulty in enrolling large numbers of study participants. Expanding our understanding of the causes of resistant hypertension and thereby potentially allowing for more effective prevention and/or treatment will be essential to improve the long-term clinical management of this disorder.},

Accordingly, we sought to determine the prevalence and outcomes of resistant hypertension in stable hypertensive outpatients with subclinical or established atherothombotic disease enrolled in the international Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health ({REACH}) registry. Methods and results Resistant hypertension was defined as a blood pressure ≥140/90 {mmHg} at baseline (≥130/80 {mmHg} if diabetes/renal insufficiency) with the use of ≥3 antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 4 years. A total of 53 530 hypertensive patients were included. The prevalence of resistant hypertension was 12.7\%; 6.2\% on 3 antihypertensive agents, 4.6\% on 4 agents, and 1.9\% on ≥5 agents (mean: 4.7 ± 0.8). In addition to a diuretic, these patients were being treated mostly with {ACE}-inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (90.1\%), beta-blockers (67.0\%), and calcium channel blockers (50.8\%). Patients with resistant hypertension had a higher risk of the primary endpoint on multivariable analysis [hazard ratio ({HR}) 1.11, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.02-1.20; P = 0.017], including an increased non-fatal stroke risk ({HR}: 1.26; 95\% {CI}: 1.10-1.45; P = 0.0008). Hospitalizations due to congestive heart failure were higher (P {\textless} 0.0001). Patients on ≥5 agents had a higher adjusted risk for the primary endpoint when compared with those on ≤3 agents (P = 0.03). Conclusion The presence of resistant hypertension identifies a subgroup of patients with hypertension and atherothrombosis who are at heightened risk for adverse long-term outcomes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Apparent treatment resistant hypertension ({aTRH}) is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and entails worse cardiovascular prognosis. The impact of {aTRH} and long-term achievement of recommended blood pressure ({BP}) values on renal outcome remains largely unknown. We assessed the role of {aTRH} and {BP} on the development of chronic kidney disease in patients with T2D and hypertension in real-life clinical practice. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Clinical records from a total of 29 923 patients with T2D and hypertension, with normal baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate and regular visits during a 4-year follow-up, were retrieved and analyzed. The association between time-updated {BP} control (ie, 75\% of visits with {BP} {\textless}140/90 mm Hg) and the occurrence of estimated glomerular filtration rate {\textless}60 and/or a reduction {\textgreater}/=30\% from baseline was assessed. At baseline, 17\% of patients had {aTRH}. Over the 4-year follow-up, 19\% developed low estimated glomerular filtration rate and 12\% an estimated glomerular filtration rate reduction {\textgreater}/=30\% from baseline. Patients with {aTRH} showed an increased risk of developing both renal outcomes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.31 and 1.43; P{\textless}0.001 respectively), as compared with those with non-{aTRH}. No association was found between {BP} control and renal outcomes in non-{aTRH}, whereas in {aTRH}, {BP} control was associated with a 30\% (P=0.036) greater risk of developing the renal end points. {CONCLUSIONS}: {ATRH} entails a worse renal prognosis in T2D with hypertension. {BP} control is not associated with a more-favorable renal outcome in {aTRH}. The relationship between time-updated {BP} and renal function seems to be J-shaped, with optimal systolic {BP} values between 120 and 140 mm Hg.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To develop a predictive model for real-time predictions of length of stay, mortality, and readmission for hospitalized patients using electronic health records ({EHRs}). {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: A Bayesian Network model was built to estimate the probability of a hospitalized patient being "at home," in the hospital, or dead for each of the next 7 days. The network utilizes patient-specific administrative and laboratory data and is updated each time a new pathology test result becomes available. Electronic health records from 32 634 patients admitted to a Sydney metropolitan hospital via the emergency department from July 2008 through December 2011 were used. The model was tested on 2011 data and trained on the data of earlier years. {RESULTS}: The model achieved an average daily accuracy of 80\% and area under the receiving operating characteristic curve ({AUROC}) of 0.82. The model's predictive ability was highest within 24 hours from prediction ({AUROC} = 0.83) and decreased slightly with time. Death was the most predictable outcome with a daily average accuracy of 93\% and {AUROC} of 0.84. {DISCUSSION}: We developed the first non-disease-specific model that simultaneously predicts remaining days of hospitalization, death, and readmission as part of the same outcome. By providing a future daily probability for each outcome class, we enable the visualization of future patient trajectories. Among these, it is possible to identify trajectories indicating expected discharge, expected continuing hospitalization, expected death, and possible readmission. {CONCLUSIONS}: Bayesian Networks can model {EHRs} to provide real-time forecasts for patient outcomes, which provide richer information than traditional independent point predictions of length of stay, death, or readmission, and can thus better support decision making.},

We aimed to study the impact of pharmacist prescribing on blood pressure ({BP}) control in community-dwelling patients. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We designed a patient-level, randomized, controlled trial, enrolling adults with above-target {BP} (as defined by Canadian guidelines) through community pharmacies, hospitals, or primary care teams in 23 communities in Alberta. Intervention group patients received an assessment of {BP} and cardiovascular risk, education on hypertension, prescribing of antihypertensive medications, laboratory monitoring, and monthly follow-up visits for 6 months (all by their pharmacist). Control group patients received a wallet card for {BP} recording, written hypertension information, and usual care from their pharmacist and physician. Primary outcome was the change in systolic {BP} at 6 months. A total of 248 patients (mean age, 64 years; 49\% male) were enrolled. Baseline mean+/-{SD} systolic/diastolic {BP} was 150+/-14/84+/-11 mm Hg.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Isolated systolic hypertension occurs in about 15\% of people aged 60 years or older. In 1989, the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly investigated whether active treatment could reduce cardiovascular complications of isolated systolic hypertension. Fatal and non-fatal stroke combined was the primary endpoint. {METHODS}: All patients ({\textgreater} 60 years) were initially started on masked placebo. At three run-in visits 1 month apart, their average sitting systolic blood pressure was 160-219 mm Hg with a diastolic blood pressure lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for centre, sex, and previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients were randomly assigned to nitrendipine 10-40 mg daily, with the possible addition of enalapril 5-20 mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-25.0 mg daily, or matching placebos. Patients withdrawing from double-blind treatment were still followed up. We compared occurrence of major endpoints by intention to treat. {FINDINGS}: At a median of 2 years' follow-up, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures had fallen by 13 mm Hg and 2 mm Hg in the placebo group (n = 2297) and by 23 mm Hg and 7 mm Hg in the active treatment group (n = 2398). The between-group differences were systolic 10.1 mm Hg (95\% {CI} 8.8-11.4) and diastolic, 4.5 mm Hg (3.9-5.1). Active treatment reduced the total rate of stroke from 13.7 to 7.9 endpoints per 1000 patient-years (42\% reduction; p = 0.003). Non-fatal stroke decreased by 44\% (p = 0.007). In the active treatment group, all fatal and non-fatal cardiac endpoints, including sudden death, declined by 26\% (p = 0.03). Non-fatal cardiac endpoints decreased by 33\% (p = 0.03) and all fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular endpoints by 31\% (p {\textless} 0.001). Cardiovascular mortality was slightly lower on active treatment (-27\%, p = 0.07), but all-cause mortality was not influenced (-14\%; p = 0.22). {INTERPRETATION}: Among elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment starting with nitrendipine reduces the rate of cardiovascular complications. Treatment of 1000 patients for 5 years with this type of regimen may prevent 29 strokes or 53 major cardiovascular endpoints.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of pseudoresistant hypertension ({HTN}) due to inaccurate {BP} measurement remains unknown. Triage {BP} measurements and measurements obtained at the same clinic visit by trained physicians were compared in consecutive adult patients referred for uncontrolled resistant {HTN} ({RHTN}). Triage {BP} measurements were taken by the clinic staff during normal intake procedures. {BP} measurements were obtained by trained physicians using the {BpTRU} ({VSM} Med Tech Ltd.

However, the proportion receiving these medications in optimal doses is unknown; {aTRH} is used because treatment adherence and measurement artifacts were not available in electronic record data from our {\textgreater}200 community-based clinics Outpatient Quality Improvement Network. This study sought to define the proportion of uncontrolled hypertensives with {aTRH} on optimal regimens and clinical factors associated with optimal therapy. During 2007-2010, 468 877 hypertensive patients met inclusion criteria. {BP} {\textless}140/{\textless}90 mm Hg defined control. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess variables independently associated with optimal therapy (prescription of diuretic and {\textgreater}/=2 other {BP} medications at {\textgreater}/=50\% of maximum recommended hypertension doses). Among 468 877 hypertensives, 147 635 (31.5\%) were uncontrolled; among uncontrolled hypertensives, 44 684 were prescribed {\textgreater}/=3 {BP} medications (30.3\%), of whom 22 189 (15.0\%) were prescribed optimal therapy. Clinical factors independently associated with optimal {BP} therapy included black race (odds ratio, 1.40 [95\% confidence interval, 1.32-1.49]), chronic kidney disease (1.31 [1.25-1.38]), diabetes mellitus (1.30 [1.24-1.37]), and coronary heart disease risk equivalent status (1.29 [1.14-1.46]). Clinicians more often prescribe optimal therapy for {aTRH} when cardiovascular risk is greater and treatment goals lower. Approximately 1 in 7 of all uncontrolled hypertensives and 1 in 2 with uncontrolled {aTRH} are prescribed {\textgreater}/=3 {BP} medications in optimal regimens.

Four groups were constituted by combining 24-h {ABP} with diagnosis of {RH} (office blood pressure {\textgreater}/=130/80 mm Hg, despite adherence to {\textgreater}/=3 full-dose antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic agent or {\textgreater}/=4 drugs): control ({ABP} {\textless}125/75 mm Hg without {RH}); pseudoresistance ({ABP} {\textless}125/75 mm Hg with {RH}); sustained hypertension ({ABP} {\textgreater}/=125/75 mm Hg without {RH}); and true resistance ({ABP} {\textgreater}/=125/75 mm Hg with {RH}). Endpoints of survival analysis were renal (end-stage renal disease or death) and cardiovascular events (fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular event). {RESULTS}: Age was 65 +/- 14 years, men 58\%, diabetes 36\%, cardiovascular disease 30\%, median proteinuria 0.24 (interquartile range 0.09 to 0.83) g/day, estimated glomerular filtration rate 43 +/- 20 ml/min/1.73 m(2), office blood pressure 146 +/- 19/82 +/- 12 mm Hg, and 24-h {ABP} 129 +/- 17/72 +/- 10 mm Hg. True resistant patients were 22.9\%, and pseudoresistant patients were 7.1\%, whereas patients with sustained hypertension were 42.9\%, and control subjects were 27.1\%. Over 57 months of follow-up, 109 cardiovascular events and 165 renal events occurred. Cardiovascular risk (hazard ratio [95\% confidence interval]) was 1.24 (0.55 to 2.78) in pseudoresistance, 1.11 (0.67 to 1.84) in sustained hypertension, and 1.98 (1.14 to 3.43) in true resistance, compared with control subjects. Corresponding hazards for renal events were 1.18 (0.45 to 3.13), 2.14 (1.35 to 3.40), and 2.66 (1.62 to 4.37). {CONCLUSIONS}: In {CKD}, pseudoresistance is not associated with an increased cardio-renal risk, and sustained hypertension predicts only renal outcome. True resistance is prevalent and identifies patients carrying the highest cardiovascular risk.},

The Blood Pressure ({BP}) control rate and {CArdiovascular} Risk {profilE} ({BP}-{CARE}) study allowed us to assess the prevalence and the main clinical features of resistant hypertension in this population. {DESIGN} {AND} {METHOD}: The study was carried out in 1312 treated hypertensive patients living in nine Central and East European countries. {RESULTS}: Four hundred and twenty-three patients had apparent resistant hypertension, of whom 168 had pseudo-resistant hypertension (noncompliant/white-coat) and 255 were true treatment-resistant hypertension patients ({TRH}). Clinical {BP} values in {TRH} amounted to 157.4+/-16.9/91.8+/-10.0 {mmHg} despite the daily use of 3.6+/-0.7 drugs. Their 24-h {BP} values were 149.5+/-16.5/97.5+/-9.8 {mmHg}. Compared to controlled hypertensive patients (n=368) and uncontrolled nonresistant hypertensive patients (n=521), {TRH} were older with a greater prevalence of women. They showed a higher rate of previous cardiovascular events and a very high cardiovascular risk profile. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower in {TRH} as compared to controlled hypertensive patients and uncontrolled nonresistant hypertensive patients. Overall, target organ damage was more frequently detected in {TRH} than in controlled hypertensive patients and uncontrolled nonresistant hypertensive patients. The factor most frequently associated with {TRH} was severity of hypertension followed by age, total cholesterol, {BMI} and history of heart failure. {CONCLUSIONS}: The present study provides evidence that the prevalence of {TRH} in Central and East European countries is similar to that found in Western Europe and {USA}. It also shows the very high cardiovascular risk of {TRH} and the elevated association of this condition with obesity, renal failure, organ damage and history of cardiovascular events.},

The {REDD} model was developed using clinical, administrative, and socioeconomic data, with data preprocessing steps and stacked classification. Patients were divided randomly into training (66.7\%), and testing (33.3\%) cohorts to avoid overfitting. {RESULTS}: The derivation cohort comprised of 64,252 admissions, of which 2782 (4.3\%) admissions resulted in 3-day {AEs} and 13,372 (20.8\%) in 30-day {AEs}. The c-statistic (also known as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 3-day {REDD} model was 0.671 and 0.664 for the derivation and validation cohort, respectively. The c-statistic of 30-day {REDD} model was 0.713 and 0.711 for the derivation and validation cohort, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS}: The 3-day {REDD} model predicts high-risk patients with fair discriminative power.

Objectives This study sought to determine the prevalence of hypertension, implications of recommendations for antihypertensive medication, and prevalence of {BP} above the treatment goal among U.S. adults using criteria from the 2017 {ACC}/{AHA} guideline and the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure ({JNC}7). Methods The authors analyzed data from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 9,623). {BP} was measured 3 times following a standardized protocol and averaged. Results were weighted to produce U.S. population estimates. Results According to the 2017 {ACC}/{AHA} and {JNC}7 guidelines, the crude prevalence of hypertension among U.S. adults was 45.6\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 43.6\% to 47.6\%) and 31.9\% (95\% {CI}: 30.1\% to 33.7\%), respectively, and antihypertensive medication was recommended for 36.2\% (95\% {CI}: 34.2\% to 38.2\%) and 34.3\% (95\% {CI}: 32.5\% to 36.2\%) of U.S. adults, respectively. Nonpharmacological intervention is advised for the 9.4\% of U.S. adults with hypertension who are not recommended for antihypertensive medication according to the 2017 {ACC}/{AHA} guideline. Among U.S. adults taking antihypertensive medication, 53.4\% (95\% {CI}: 49.9\% to 56.8\%) and 39.0\% (95\% {CI}: 36.4\% to 41.6\%) had {BP} above the treatment goal according to the 2017 {ACC}/{AHA} and {JNC}7 guidelines, respectively. Conclusions Compared with the {JNC}7 guideline, the 2017 {ACC}/{AHA} guideline results in a substantial increase in the prevalence of hypertension, a small increase in the percentage of U.S. adults recommended for antihypertensive medication, and more intensive {BP} lowering for many adults taking antihypertensive medication.},

However, data on the national impact of {CHD} on health-related quality of life, particularly among people of different age, sex, racial, and ethnic groups, are limited. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Using data from the 2000 and 2002 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we examined various measures of patient-reported health status, including health-related quality of life, in the {CHD} and non-{CHD} populations and differences in the measures among demographic subgroups. These measures included short-form generic measures (Short Form 12; Mental Component Summary-12 and Physical Component Summary-12) and {EuroQol} Group measures ({EQ}-5D index and {EQ} visual analog scale). Ordinary least-squares regressions were used to adjust for sociodemographic characteristics, risk factors, comorbidities, and proxy report. The adjusted difference between the {CHD} and non-{CHD} populations was -1.2 for Mental Component Summary-12 (2.4\% of the score in the non-{CHD} population), -4.6 for Physical Component Summary-12 (9.2\%), -0.04 for {EQ}-5D (4.6\%), and -7.3 for {EQ} visual analog scale (9.0\%) (all P{\textless}0.05).

	abstract = {Objectives: A goal {SBP} 120 {mmHg} or less reduced mortality in high-risk Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial patients; however, mortality implications of concomitant {DBP} lowering in coronary artery disease ({CAD}) are uncertain. We examined the relationship between {DBP} lowering and all-cause mortality with lower achieved {SBPs} in a large cohort. Methods: We categorized 17 131 hypertensive patients from the {INternational} {VErapamil}-Trandolapril {STudy} {US} cohort, aged at least 50 years with {CAD}, by mean achieved {SBP} ({\textless}120, 120 to {\textless}130, 130 to {\textless}140, and ≥140 {mmHg}) and {DBP} tertiles (low, middle, and high per {SBP} category) during active follow-up. Long-Term mortality was determined via National Death Index. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to investigate the impact of {DBP} lowering among all {SBP} categories and within each {SBP} category. Results: There were 6031 deaths over mean follow-up of 11.6 years (198 352 patient-years). In unadjusted analyses, achieving {DBP} in the lowest tertile portended greatest mortality risk across all {SBP} categories. In multivariate analysis, using {SBP} 120 to less than 130 {mmHg}, {DBP} at least 79 {mmHg} as reference (mortality nadir), achieving {DBP} in the lowest tertile ({DBP} {\textless} 69 {mmHg}) was associated with excess mortality risk among those with {SBP} less than 120 {mmHg} (adjusted hazard ratio 1.60; 95\% confidence interval, 1.33-1.91). However, among those with {SBP} 120 to less than 140 {mmHg}, adjusted mortality risk did not differ significantly with low {DBPs}. Among those with {SBP} at least 140 {mmHg}, mortality risk remained high regardless of {DBP}. Conclusion: In older {CAD} patients, the mortality risk related to excess {DBP} lowering is accentuated in those achieving intensive {SBP} control less than 120 {mmHg}, raising concerns about intensive {SBP} lowering in these patients.},

	abstract = {The healthy user bias is usually overlooked as an explanation in studies in which a strong association is found between poor patient medication adherence and worse disease outcomes. Such studies are increasing in frequency across disease states and influence clinical practice. Adherence to antihypertensive medications was studied to illustrate confounding in such studies.{\textbar}Using data from veterans with hypertension starting antihypertensive treatment, causal models were developed that predicted the risks of hospitalisation, myocardial infarction ({MI}) and death associated with poor adherence ({\textless}80\%) while adjusting for patient demographics, baseline disease severity and disease comorbidity. In a second set of otherwise identical models, adjustment was made for time-varying blood pressure ({BP}), thus controlling for adherence effects that were mediated through the main pharmacological effects of the drugs. It was hypothesised that the second set of models would reveal a positive association between poor adherence and adverse disease outcomes that is largely explained by unmeasured confounders, including health-related behaviours.{\textbar}The models that did not adjust for time-varying {BP} levels showed that patients with poor adherence had statistically significantly increased risks of 3.7\% for hospitalisation, 28.1\% for {MI} and 23.3\% for death. These estimates exceed the benefits of these drugs demonstrated by clinical trials. When controlling for time-varying {BP}, the increased risks were similar (3.4\% for hospitalisation, 27.7\% for {MI} and 23.4\% for death). The findings were consistent across a range of adherence thresholds (50-90\%) and when allowing disease status variables to vary.{\textbar}The associations between poor adherence and outcomes are largely independent of the pharmacological effects of the drugs on {BP} control as well as commonly measured patient covariates. This finding suggests that even carefully designed observational adherence studies using rich clinical data are impossibly confounded and probably overestimate the true magnitude of the effect. Clinical practice guidelines based on reported adherence effects should be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {Importance: Since the start of the {COVID}-19 pandemic, few studies have assessed the association of telehealth with outcomes of care, including patterns of health care use after the initial encounter. Objective: To assess the association of telehealth and in-person visits with outcomes of care during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study assessed continuously enrolled members in private health plans of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association from July 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes were ambulatory encounters per enrollee stratified by characteristics derived from enrollment files, practitioner claims, and community characteristics linked to the enrollee's zip code. Outcomes of care were assessed 14 days after the initial encounters and included follow-up encounters of any kind, emergency department encounters, and hospitalizations after initial telehealth or in-person encounters. Results: In this cohort study of 40739915 individuals (mean [{SD}] age, 35.37 [18.77] years; 20480768 [50.3\%] female), ambulatory encounters decreased by 1.0\% and the number of in-person encounters per enrollee decreased by 17.0\% from 2019 to 2020; however, as a proportion of all ambulatory encounters, telehealth encounters increased substantially from 0.6\% (n = 236220) to 14.1\% (n = 5743718). For members with an initial telehealth encounter for a new acute condition, the adjusted odds ratio was 1.44 (95\% {CI}, 1.42-1.46) for all follow-ups combined and 1.11 (95\% {CI}, 1.06-1.16) for an emergency department encounter. For members with an initial telehealth encounter for a new chronic condition, the adjusted odds ratios were 0.94 (95\% {CI}, 0.92-0.95) for all follow-ups combined and 0.94 (95\% {CI}, 0.90-0.99) for in-patient admissions. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of 40.7 million commercially insured adults, telehealth accounted for a large share of ambulatory encounters at the peak of the pandemic and remained prevalent after infection rates subsided. Telehealth encounters for chronic conditions had similar rates of follow-up to in-person encounters for these conditions, whereas telehealth encounters for acute conditions seemed to be more likely than in-person encounters to require follow-up. These findings suggest a direction for future work and are relevant to policy makers, payers, and practitioners as they manage the use of telehealth during the {COVID}-19 pandemic and afterward.},

We sought to evaluate the current state of {EHR} based risk prediction modeling through a systematic review of clinical prediction studies using {EHR} data. {METHODS}: We searched {PubMed} for articles that reported on the use of an {EHR} to develop a risk prediction model from 2009 to 2014. Articles were extracted by two reviewers, and we abstracted information on study design, use of {EHR} data, model building, and performance from each publication and supplementary documentation. {RESULTS}: We identified 107 articles from 15 different countries. Studies were generally very large (median sample size = 26 100) and utilized a diverse array of predictors. Most used validation techniques (n = 94 of 107) and reported model coefficients for reproducibility (n = 83). However, studies did not fully leverage the breadth of {EHR} data, as they uncommonly used longitudinal information (n = 37) and employed relatively few predictor variables (median = 27 variables). Less than half of the studies were multicenter (n = 50) and only 26 performed validation across sites. Many studies did not fully address biases of {EHR} data such as missing data or loss to follow-up. Average c-statistics for different outcomes were: mortality (0.84), clinical prediction (0.83), hospitalization (0.71), and service utilization (0.71). {CONCLUSIONS}: {EHR} data present both opportunities and challenges for clinical risk prediction. There is room for improvement in designing such studies.},

	abstract = {Recognition and treatment of secondary causes of hypertension among patients with resistant hypertension may help to control blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular risk. However, there are no studies systematically evaluating secondary causes of hypertension according to the Seventh Joint National Committee. Consecutive patients with resistant hypertension were investigated for known causes of hypertension irrespective of symptoms and signs, including aortic coarctation, Cushing syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, drugs, pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism, renal parenchymal disease, renovascular hypertension, and thyroid disorders. Among 125 patients (age: 52±1 years, 43\% males, systolic and diastolic blood pressure: 176±31 and 107±19 mm Hg, respectively), obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index: {\textgreater}15 events per hour) was the most common condition associated with resistant hypertension (64.0\%), followed by primary aldosteronism (5.6\%), renal artery stenosis (2.4\%), renal parenchymal disease (1.6\%), oral contraceptives (1.6\%), and thyroid disorders (0.8\%). In 34.4\%, no secondary cause of hypertension was identified (primary hypertension). Two concomitant secondary causes of hypertension were found in 6.4\% of patients. Age {\textgreater}50 years (odds ratio: 5.2 [95\% {CI}: 1.9-14.2]; P{\textless}0.01), neck circumference ≥41 cm for women and ≥43 cm for men (odds ratio: 4.7 [95\% {CI}: 1.3-16.9]; P=0.02), and presence of snoring (odds ratio: 3.7 [95\% {CI}: 1.3-11]; P=0.02) were predictors of obstructive sleep apnea. In conclusion, obstructive sleep apnea appears to be the most common condition associated with resistant hypertension. Age {\textgreater}50 years, large neck circumference measurement, and snoring are good predictors of obstructive sleep apnea in this population.},

	abstract = {Background: Women are at greater risk of developing resistant hypertension ({RH}) than men, yet scarce data exist on {RH}-associated outcomes in women. We aimed to determine all-cause mortality risk associated with apparent {RH} ({aRH}) among women across the spectrum of underlying coronary disease. Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from St. James Women Take Heart ({WTH}; women without coronary disease at baseline), Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (women with signs/symptoms of ischemia at baseline), and the {INternational} {VErapamil}-Trandolapril {STudy} ({INVEST}; women with coronary artery disease and hypertension at baseline), totaling 15,108 adult women with no hypertension, non-{RH} (blood pressure [{BP}] ≥140/90 {mmHg} on ≤2 drugs or {BP} {\textless}140/90 {mmHg} on 1-3 drugs), or {aRH} ({BP} ≥140/90 {mmHg} on ≥3 drugs or anyone on ≥4 drugs) at baseline. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Results: Prevalence of {aRH} ranged from 0.4\% ({WTH}) to 10.6\% ({INVEST}). Women with {aRH}, compared to those without, were older, more often black, and more likely to be obese or diabetic. Pooling all cohorts, risk for all-cause death was greater in women with {aRH} than in women with non-{RH} (adjusted {HR} 1.40; 95\% {CI} 1.27-1.55) and women without hypertension (adjusted {HR} 2.34; 95\% {CI} 1.76-3.11) over a median follow-up of 14.3 years. Conclusions: {aRH} prevalence in women varies according to underlying coronary disease, and {aRH} is associated with a substantial, early, and sustained increased risk of all-cause death. Additional research into early recognition and prevention strategies for {RH} are needed, especially in black and older women, and those with known cardiovascular risk factors.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 ({GBD} 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals ({UIs}), separately by age and sex. {METHODS}: We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model ({CODEm}) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95\% {UIs}. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the {GBD} 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and {HIV}/{AIDS}), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95\% {UIs} that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where {CODEm} was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. {FINDINGS}: In 2010, there were 52.8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24.9\% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15.9 million (34.1\%) of 46.5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2.5 to 1.4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3.4 to 2.8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3.1 to 2.2 million), measles (from 0.63 to 0.13 million), and tetanus (from 0.27 to 0.06 million). Deaths from {HIV}/{AIDS} increased from 0.30 million in 1990 to 1.5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1.7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19.9\% since 1990 to 1.17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1.2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34.5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38\% more than two decades ago; of these, 1.5 million (19\%) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12.9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1.3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5.1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9.6\%) compared with two decades earlier (8.8\%). This was driven by a 46\% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1.3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and {HIV}/{AIDS} were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and {HIV}/{AIDS} were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality ({YLLs}) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for {HIV}/{AIDS} and preterm birth complications. {YLLs} from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54\% since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke {YLLs} increased by 17-28\%. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76\% of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose ({HIV}/{AIDS}, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, {COPD}, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted. {INTERPRETATION}: Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of {YLLs} in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis. {FUNDING}: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

We evaluated the functioning and well-being of 9385 adults at the time of office visits to 362 physicians in three {US} cities, using brief surveys completed by both patients and physicians. For eight of nine common chronic medical conditions, patients with the condition showed markedly worse physical, role, and social functioning; mental health; health perceptions; and/or bodily pain compared with patients with no chronic conditions. Each condition had a unique profile among the various health components. Hypertension had the least overall impact; heart disease and patient-reported gastrointestinal disorders had the greatest impact. Patients with multiple conditions showed greater decrements in functioning and well-being than those with only one condition. Substantial variations in functioning and well-being within each chronic condition group remain to be explained.},

Standardized questions on awareness were given to all women; additional questions about preventive behaviors/barriers were given online. Data were weighted, and results were compared with triennial surveys since 1997. Between 1997 and 2012, the rate of awareness of {CVD} as the leading cause of death nearly doubled (56\% versus 30\%; P{\textless}0.001). The rate of awareness among black and Hispanic women in 2012 (36\% and 34\%, respectively) was similar to that of white women in 1997 (33\%). In 1997, women were more likely to cite cancer than {CVD} as the leading killer (35\% versus 30\%), but in 2012, the trend reversed (24\% versus 56\%). Awareness of atypical symptoms of {CVD} has improved since 1997 but remains low. The most common reasons why women took preventive action were to improve health and to feel better, not to live longer. {CONCLUSIONS}: Awareness of {CVD} among women has improved in the past 15 years, but a significant racial/ethnic minority gap persists. Continued effort is needed to reach at-risk populations. These data should inform public health campaigns to focus on evidenced-based strategies to prevent {CVD} and to help target messages that resonate and motivate women to take action.},

	abstract = {A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to assess the effects of verapamil on total mortality, cardiac mortality, reinfarction, and angina after an acute myocardial infarction. All patients, aged 30 to 75 years, consecutively admitted for acute myocardial infarction between 1985 and 1987 to the participating centers, and without contraindications to verapamil or history of severe heart failure were enrolled. Seven to 21 days (mean 13.8) after myocardial infarction, 531 patients were randomized to verapamil retard 360 mg/day, and 542 patients to placebo. At baseline, the 2 groups of patients had similar characteristics. Mean age was 55.5 years and 91\% were men. During a mean follow-up of 23.5 months, 5.5\% of the patients died. No differences between verapamil and placebo were observed in total mortality (n = 30 and 29, respectively) and cardiac death (n = 21 and 22, respectively). The verapamil group had nonsignificant lower reinfarction rates (n = 39 vs 49). The number of patients developing angina was significantly less in the verapamil group (n = 100 vs 132, {RR} = 0.8, 95\% confidence interval 0.5 to 0.9). There were no differences in discontinuation of therapy caused by adverse reactions. This trial showed no effect of verapamil on mortality. The lower reinfarction rates found in the verapamil group are in agreement with the results of other studies.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Treatment of hypertension with diuretics, beta-blockers, or both leads to improved outcomes. It has been postulated that agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system confer benefit beyond the reduction of blood pressure alone. We compared the outcomes in older subjects with hypertension who were treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors with the outcomes in those treated with diuretic agents. {METHODS}: We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label study with blinded assessment of end points in 6083 subjects with hypertension who were 65 to 84 years of age and received health care at 1594 family practices. Subjects were followed for a median of 4.1 years, and the total numbers of cardiovascular events in the two treatment groups were compared with the use of multivariate proportional-hazards models. {RESULTS}: At base line, the treatment groups were well matched in terms of age, sex, and blood pressure. By the end of the study, blood pressure had decreased to a similar extent in both groups (a decrease of 26/12 mm Hg). There were 695 cardiovascular events or deaths from any cause in the {ACE}-inhibitor group (56.1 per 1000 patient-years) and 736 cardiovascular events or deaths from any cause in the diuretic group (59.8 per 1000 patient-years; the hazard ratio for a cardiovascular event or death with {ACE}-inhibitor treatment was 0.89 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.00]; P=0.05). Among male subjects, the hazard ratio was 0.83 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 0.97; P=0.02); among female subjects, the hazard ratio was 1.00 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.21; P=0.98); the P value for the interaction between sex and treatment-group assignment was 0.15. The rates of nonfatal cardiovascular events and myocardial infarctions decreased with {ACE}-inhibitor treatment, whereas a similar number of strokes occurred in each group (although there were more fatal strokes in the {ACE}-inhibitor group). {CONCLUSIONS}: Initiation of antihypertensive treatment involving {ACE} inhibitors in older subjects, particularly men, appears to lead to better outcomes than treatment with diuretic agents, despite similar reductions of blood pressure.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee panel recommendations for management of high blood pressure ({BP}) recommend a systolic {BP} threshold for initiation of drug therapy and a therapeutic target of {\textless}150 mm Hg in those {\textgreater}/=60 years of age, a departure from prior recommendations of {\textless}140 mm Hg. However, it is not known whether this is an optimal choice, especially for the large population with coronary artery disease ({CAD}). {OBJECTIVES}: This study sought to evaluate optimal {BP} in patients {\textgreater}/=60 years of age. {METHODS}: Patients 60 years of age or older with {CAD} and baseline systolic {BP} {\textgreater}150 mm Hg randomized to a treatment strategy on the basis of either atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide or verapamil-{SR} (sustained release)/trandolapril in {INVEST} ({INternational} {VErapamil} {SR} Trandolapril {STudy}) were categorized into 3 groups on the basis of achieved on-treatment systolic {BP}: group 1, {\textless}140 mm Hg; group 2, 140 to {\textless}150 mm Hg; and group 3, {\textgreater}/=150 mm Hg. Primary outcome was first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction ({MI}), or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, total {MI}, nonfatal {MI}, total stroke, nonfatal stroke, heart failure, or revascularization, tabulated separately. Outcomes for each group were compared in unadjusted and multiple propensity score-adjusted models. {RESULTS}: Among 8,354 patients included in this analysis with an accumulated 22,308 patient-years of follow-up, 4,787 (57\%) achieved systolic {BP} of {\textless}140 mm Hg (group 1), 1,747 (21\%) achieved systolic {BP} of 140 to {\textless}150 mm Hg (group 2), and 1,820 (22\%) achieved systolic {BP} of {\textgreater}/=150 mm Hg (group 3). In unadjusted models, group 1 had the lowest rates of the primary outcome (9.36\% vs. 12.71\% vs. 21.32\%; p {\textless} 0.0001), all-cause mortality (7.92\% vs. 10.07\% vs. 16.81\%; p {\textless} 0.0001), cardiovascular mortality (3.26\% vs. 4.58\% vs. 7.80\%; p {\textless} 0.0001), {MI} (1.07\% vs. 1.03\% vs. 2.91\%; p {\textless} 0.0001), total stroke (1.19\% vs. 2.63\% vs. 3.85\%; p {\textless}0.0001), and nonfatal stroke (0.86\% vs 1.89\% vs 2.86\%; p{\textless}0.0001) compared with groups 2 and 3, respectively. In multiple propensity score-adjusted models, compared with the reference group of {\textless}140 mm Hg (group 1), the risk of cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [{HR}]: 1.34; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 1.01 to 1.77; p = 0.04), total stroke (adjusted {HR}: 1.89; 95\% {CI}: 1.26 to 2.82; p = 0.002) and nonfatal stroke (adjusted {HR}: 1.70; 95\% {CI}: 1.06 to 2.72; p = 0.03) was increased in the group with {BP} of 140 to {\textless}150 mm Hg, whereas the risk of primary outcome, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, total {MI}, nonfatal {MI}, total stroke, and nonfatal stroke was increased in the group with {BP} {\textgreater}/=150 mm Hg. {CONCLUSIONS}: In hypertensive patients with {CAD} who are {\textgreater}/=60 years of age, achieving a {BP} target of 140 to {\textless}150 mm Hg as recommended by the {JNC}-8 panel was associated with less benefit than the previously recommended target of {\textless}140 mm Hg.},

	abstract = {Background: Approximately half of all women with anginal symptoms and/or signs of ischemia and no obstructive coronary artery disease ({INOCA}) referred for coronary angiography have elevated risk for major adverse cardiac events ({MACE}), poor quality of life and resource consumption. Yet, guidelines focus on symptom management while clinical practice typically advocates only reassurance. Pilot studies of {INOCA} subjects suggest benefit with intensive medical therapy ({IMT}) that includes high-intensity statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ({ACE}-I) or receptor blockers ({ARB}) to provide the rationale for a randomized pragmatic trial to limit {MACE}. Methods: The Women's {IschemiA} {TRial} to Reduce Events In Non-{ObstRuctive} {CAD} is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, blinded outcome evaluation ({PROBE} design) of a pragmatic strategy of {IMT} vs usual care ({UC}) in 4,422 symptomatic women with {INOCA} ({NCT} 03417388) in approximately 70 United States sites. The hypothesis is that {IMT} will reduce the primary outcome of first occurrence of {MACE} by 20\% vs. {UC} at ∼2.5 year followup. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, time to return to “duty”/work, healthcare utilization, angina, cardiovascular death and individual primary outcome components over 3 years follow-up. The study utilizes web-based data capture, e-consents, single {IRB} and centralized pharmacy distribution of strategy medications directly to patients’ homes to reduce site and patient burden. A biorepository will collect blood samples to assess potential mechanisms. Conclusions: The results of this trial will provide important data necessary to inform guidelines regarding how best to manage this growing and challenging population of women with {INOCA}.},

As long as efficacy and effectiveness trials are considered complete without considering implementation in nonresearch settings, the public health potential of the original investments will not be realized. A barrier to progress is the absence of a practical, robust model to help identify the factors that need to be considered and addressed and how to measure success. A conceptual framework for improving practice is needed to integrate the key features for successful program design, predictors of implementation and diffusion, and appropriate outcome measures. Developing {PRISM}: A comprehensive model for translating research into practice was developed using concepts from the areas of quality improvement, chronic care, the diffusion of innovations, and measures of the population-based effectiveness of translation. {PRISM} - the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model - evaluates how the health care program or intervention interacts with the recipients to influence program adoption, implementation, maintenance, reach, and effectiveness. Discussion: The {PRISM} model provides a new tool for researchers and health care decision makers that integrates existing concepts relevant to translating research into practice.},

	doi = {10.1186/1748-5908-4-25},
	abstract = {Background. Despite decades of efforts to improve quality of health care, poor performance persists in many aspects of care. Less than 1\% of the enormous national investment in medical research is focused on improving health care delivery. Furthermore, when effective innovations in clinical care are discovered, uptake of these innovations is often delayed and incomplete. In this paper, we build on the established principle of 'positive deviance' to propose an approach to identifying practices that improve health care quality. Methods. We synthesize existing literature on positive deviance, describe major alternative approaches, propose benefits and limitations of a positive deviance approach for research directed toward improving quality of health care, and describe an application of this approach in improving hospital care for patients with acute myocardial infarction. Results. The positive deviance approach, as adapted for use in health care, presumes that the knowledge about 'what works' is available in existing organizations that demonstrate consistently exceptional performance. Steps in this approach: identify 'positive deviants,' i.e., organizations that consistently demonstrate exceptionally high performance in the area of interest (e.g., proper medication use, timeliness of care); study the organizations in-depth using qualitative methods to generate hypotheses about practices that allow organizations to achieve top performance; test hypotheses statistically in larger, representative samples of organizations; and work in partnership with key stakeholders, including potential adopters, to disseminate the evidence about newly characterized best practices. The approach is particularly appropriate in situations where organizations can be ranked reliably based on valid performance measures, where there is substantial natural variation in performance within an industry, when openness about practices to achieve exceptional performance exists, and where there is an engaged constituency to promote uptake of discovered practices. Conclusion. The identification and examination of health care organizations that demonstrate positive deviance provides an opportunity to characterize and disseminate strategies for improving quality. © 2009 Bradley et al; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

Million Hearts ({US} Department of Health and Human Services) is a national initiative that promotes a set of priorities and interventions to optimize delivery of evidence-based strategies to manage cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. The {COVID}-19 pandemic, however, has disrupted routine care and preventive service delivery. We identified examples of clinical and health organizations that adapted services and care processes to continue a focus on monitoring and controlling hypertension during the pandemic. Eight Hypertension Control Exemplars were identified and interviewed. They reported various adapted care strategies including telemedicine, engaging patients in self-measured blood pressure monitoring, adapting or implementing medication management services, activating partnerships to respond to patient needs or expand services, and implementing unique patient outreach approaches. Documenting these hypertension control strategies can help increase adoption of adaptive approaches during public health emergencies and routine care.},

Because many of these temporary flexibilities have expired or are set to expire, we analyzed trends in interstate telehealth use by Medicare beneficiaries during 2017-20, which covers the period both directly before and during the first year of the pandemic. Although the volume of interstate telehealth use increased in 2020, out-of-state telehealth made up a small share of all outpatient visits (0.8 percent) and of all telehealth visits (5 percent) overall. For individual states, out-of-state telehealth made up between 0.2 percent and 9.3 percent of all outpatient visits. We found that most out-of-state telehealth use was for established patient care and that a higher percentage of out-of-state telehealth users lived in rural areas compared with beneficiaries who did not receive care outside of their state (28 percent versus 23 percent). Our collective findings suggest that the elimination of pandemic licensure flexibilities will affect different states to varying degrees and will also affect the delivery of care for both established patients and rural patients.},

	abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic has impacted clinical care worldwide. Evidence of how this health crisis affected common conditions like blood pressure ({BP}) control is uncertain. Methods: We used longitudinal {BP} data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial to examine variations in home {BP} monitored via a smartphone-based application (app) in a total of 7394 elderly patients with hypertension aged 60 to 80 years stratified by their location in Wuhan (n=283) compared with other provinces of China (n=7111). Change in morning systolic {BP} ({SBP}) was analyzed for 5 30-day phases during the pandemic, including preepidemic (October 21 to November 20, 2019), incubation (November 21 to December 20, 2019), developing (December 21, 2019 to January 20, 2020), outbreak (January 21 to February 20, 2020), and plateau (February 21 to March 21, 2020). Results: Compared with non-Wuhan areas of China, average morning {SBP} (adjusted for age, sex, body mass index) in Wuhan patients was significantly higher during the epidemic growth phases, which returned to normal at the plateau. Between-group differences in Δ{SBP} were +2.5, +3.0, and +2.1 mm Hg at the incubation, developing, and outbreak phases of {COVID}-19 (P{\textless}0.001), respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed a similar trend in trajectory pattern of {SBP} in both the intensive and standard {BP} control groups of the trial. Patients in Wuhan also had an increased regimen change in antihypertensive drugs during the outbreak compared with non-Wuhan patients. Expectedly, Wuhan patients were more likely to check their {BP} via the app, while doctors were less likely to monitor the app for {BP} control during the pandemic. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that the {COVID}-19 pandemic was associated with a short-term increase in morning {SBP} among elderly patients with hypertension in Wuhan but not other parts of China. Further study will be needed to understand if these findings extended to other parts of the world substantially affected by the virus. Registration: {URL}: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

	abstract = {Background: In patients with stable international normalized ratios, 12-week extended-interval warfarin monitoring can be considered; however, predictors of success with this strategy are unknown. The previously validated {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 score (considering sex, age, medical history, treatment, tobacco, and race) predicts anticoagulation control during standard follow-up (every 4 weeks), with lower scores associated with greater time in therapeutic range. Objective: To evaluate the ability of the {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 score in predicting success with extended-interval warfarin follow-up in patients with previously stable warfarin doses. Methods: In this post hoc analysis of a single-arm feasibility study, baseline {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 scores were calculated for patients with ≥1 extended-interval follow-up visit. The primary analysis assessed achieved weeks of extended-interval follow-up according to baseline {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 scores. Results: A total of 47 patients receiving chronic anticoagulation completed a median of 36 weeks of extended-interval follow-up. The median baseline {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 score was 1 (range 0-5). Lower {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 scores appeared to be associated with greater duration of extended-interval follow-up achieved, though the differences between scores were not statistically significant. No individual variable of the {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 score was associated with achieved weeks of extended-interval follow-up. Analysis of additional patient factors found that longer duration (≥24 weeks) of prior stable treatment was significantly associated with greater weeks of extended-interval follow-up completed (P = 0.04). Conclusion and Relevance: This pilot study provides limited evidence that the {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 score predicts success with extended-interval warfarin follow-up but requires confirmation in a larger study. Further research is also necessary to establish additional predictors of successful extended-interval warfarin follow-up.},

This review aims to summarize recent data on potential mechanisms of resistance and discuss current pharmacotherapeutic options available in the management of {TRH}. Recent Findings: Excess sodium and fluid retention, increased activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and heightened activity of the sympathetic nervous system appear to play an important role in development of {TRH}. Emerging evidence also suggests a role for arterial stiffness and, potentially, gut dysbiosis. Therapeutic approaches for {TRH} should include diuretic optimization and the addition of aldosterone antagonists as the preferred fourth agent in most patients. Further therapeutic approaches may be guided by the suspected underlying mechanism of {TRH} in conjunction with other patient-specific factors. Summary: The pathophysiology of {TRH} is multifaceted; however, increasing evidence supports several mechanisms that may be targeted to improve blood pressure control among patients with {TRH}. Further studies are needed to determine whether such approaches may be more effective than usual care.},

	abstract = {A goal of many health studies is to determine the causal effect of a treatment or intervention on health outcomes. Often, it is not ethically or practically possible to conduct a perfectly randomized experiment, and instead, an observational study must be used. A major challenge to the validity of observational studies is the possibility of unmeasured confounding (i.e., unmeasured ways in which the treatment and control groups differ before treatment administration, which also affect the outcome). Instrumental variables analysis is a method for controlling for unmeasured confounding. This type of analysis requires the measurement of a valid instrumental variable, which is a variable that (i) is independent of the unmeasured confounding; (ii) affects the treatment; and (iii) affects the outcome only indirectly through its effect on the treatment. This tutorial discusses the types of causal effects that can be estimated by instrumental variables analysis; the assumptions needed for instrumental variables analysis to provide valid estimates of causal effects and sensitivity analysis for those assumptions; methods of estimation of causal effects using instrumental variables; and sources of instrumental variables in health studies. © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The most frequent medical intervention performed by a doctor is the writing of a prescription. Because chronic illness increases with advancing age, older people are more likely to have conditions that require drug treatment. Advanced age, frailty, and increased use of drugs are all factors that contribute to a patient's risk of developing a drug related problem. As many as 28\% of hospital admissions in the United States of older people are as a result of drug related problems,1 up to 70\% of which are attributed to adverse reactions to drugs.1 Creating optimal drug regimens that meet the complex needs of elderly people requires thought and careful planning.

Inappropriate prescribing is expensive. In a recent study the costs of preventable adverse drug events—namely, injury resulting from a drug related medical intervention—occurring during a stay in hospital were estimated to be \$2.8m (£1.75) annually in two large American teaching hospitals.2 The national cost of managing the consequences of inappropriate prescribing remains uncertain. One estimate has put the annual cost of drug related morbidity and mortality in outpatient clinics at \$76.6bn.3 Drug related morbidity and mortality is an important area to target both to improve the quality of medical care for elderly people and to reduce the costs of health care for this population.

A prescriber can do little to modify age related physiological changes in trying to minimise the likelihood that an older person will develop an adverse drug reaction. However, when assessing a patient who is already taking drugs, a doctor should always consider the development of any new signs and symptoms as a possible consequence of the patient's drug treatment. This article will focus on an under-recognised, and largely preventable drug related problem that we have termed the “prescribing cascade.” 4 The prescribing cascade begins …},

	doi = {10.1101/2020.03.19.20038596},
	abstract = {Objective Using {US} claims data and the most up-to-date pharmacoepidemiological study design tools we aimed to investigate two safety signals for (1) macrolides and heart failure; and (2) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ({NSAIDs}) and pneumonia generated from a large-scale screening analysis using a self-controlled sequence symmetry design in Danish data.

Methods We used {IBM} Marketscan data to conduct two new-user, active-comparator cohort studies. In the macrolides example, the exposure was clarithromycin or azithromycin and the comparator was amoxicillin/clavulanate, in patients with sinusitis. In the {NSAIDs} example, the exposure was oral {NSAIDs} and the comparator was topical diclofenac, in patients with osteoarthritis. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios ({HR}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) to adjust for approximately 50 investigator-specified confounders in a propensity score ({PS}) matched analysis. In a secondary analysis, we used high-dimensional {PS} (hd-{PS}) to adjust for 200 additional proxy confounders.

Results We had 1,012,364 propensity score matched patients exposed to clarithromycin or azithromycin versus amoxicillin/clavulanate. With 162 outcomes among clarithromycin or azithromycin exposed patients and 134 among amoxicillin/clavulanate, the {HR} for overall heart failure was 1.14 (95\% {CI} 0.90 – 1.43). In the {NSAIDs} example, we included 94,490 patients after propensity score matching. With 794 pneumonia outcomes among oral {NSAID} patients and 700 among topical diclofenac, we found {HR} 0.98 (95\% {CI} 0.89 – 1.09). Some upward bias was suspected as larger {HRs} were observed in the days immediately following exposure for both the macrolides and {NSAIDs} examples. We found similar results in the hd-{PS} matched analyses for both examples.

Conclusion Our findings for {NSAIDs} and pneumonia suggest the original signal may have been due to protopathic or detection bias. Our analyses for macrolides and heart failure with short-term follow-up also suggest bias, although we encourage further research.

	abstract = {Drug-associated ototoxicity is a potentially irreversible adverse event. Among the several 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) available in the United States, only atorvastatin is associated with tinnitus, but none are associated with any forms of hearing loss. A search of the published literature (1950-August 2011) revealed no published case reports of ototoxicity associated with statins. To our knowledge, we describe the first case of progressive, irreversible hearing loss in a 32-year-old man 18 months after starting atorvastatin therapy. He began taking atorvastatin 20 mg every evening for treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Six months later, he complained of occasional episodes of tinnitus, which resolved spontaneously. An audiogram was obtained and was normal. By 18 months, the tinnitus became continuous. Another audiogram revealed bilateral "cookie-bite" middle-frequency hearing loss. Atorvastatin was immediately discontinued, and the patient was fitted with hearing aids. Four years after drug discontinuation, his hearing loss had neither progressed nor regressed. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a possible (score of 2) temporal and causal relationship between the patient's hearing loss and atorvastatin. Causes of "cookie-bite" hearing loss include chronic exposure to loud noises, presbycusis, genetic predisposition, and drugs. The manufacturer of atorvastatin has received three unpublished cases of deafness, but claims that causal relationships were not established. Despite these claims by the manufacturer, based on this case report, we recommend that clinicians and patients be aware of the risk of atorvastatin-associated tinnitus and permanent hearing loss. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanism and frequency of this adverse event. Copyright © 1999-2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Statins are extensively used for cardiovascular disease prevention. Statins reduce mortality rates more than other lipid-modulating drugs, although evidence from randomized controlled trials also suggests that statins unexpectedly increase the risk of diabetes and improve immune function. Physiologically, statins would be expected to lower androgens because statins inhibit production of the substrate for the local synthesis of androgens and statins' pleiotropic effects are somewhat similar to the physiological effects of lowering testosterone, so we hypothesized that statins lower testosterone.Methods: A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials of statins to test the a priori hypothesis that statins lower testosterone. We searched the {PubMed}, Medline and {ISI} Web of Science databases until the end of 2011, using '(Testosterone {OR} androgen) {AND} ({CS}-514 {OR} statin {OR} simvastatin {OR} atorvastatin {OR} fluvastatin {OR} lovastatin {OR} rosuvastatin {OR} pravastatin)' restricted to randomized controlled trials in English, supplemented by a bibliographic search. We included studies with durations of 2+ weeks reporting changes in testosterone. Two reviewers independently searched, selected and assessed study quality. Two statisticians independently abstracted and analyzed data, using random or fixed effects models, as appropriate, with inverse variance weighting.Results: Of the 29 studies identified 11 were eligible. In 5 homogenous trials of 501 men, mainly middle aged with hypercholesterolemia, statins lowered testosterone by -0.66 nmol/l (95\% confidence interval ({CI}) -0.14 to -1.18). In 6 heterogeneous trials of 368 young women with polycystic ovary syndrome, statins lowered testosterone by -0.40 nmol/l (95\% {CI} -0.05 to -0.75). Overall statins lowered testosterone by -0.44 nmol/l (95\% {CI} -0.75 to -0.13).Conclusions: Statins may partially operate by lowering testosterone. Whether this is a detrimental side effect or mode of action warrants investigation given the potential implications for drug development and prevention of non-communicable chronic diseases. © 2013 Schooling et al; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

A case-crossover study of 68 028 patients with incident acute memory loss evaluated exposure to statins during the period immediately before the outcome vs 3 earlier periods. Analysis was conducted from July 7, 2013, through January 15, 2015. {RESULTS}: When compared with matched nonusers of any {LLDs} (using odds ratio [95\% {CI}]), a strong association was present between first exposure to statins and incident acute memory loss diagnosed within 30 days immediately following exposure (fully adjusted, 4.40; 3.01-6.41). This association was not reproduced in the comparison of statins vs nonstatin {LLDs} (fully adjusted, 1.03; 0.63-1.66) but was also present when comparing nonstatin {LLDs} with matched nonuser controls (adjusted, 3.60; 1.34-9.70).

A number of drugs such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, penicillamine, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and interferons may induce de novo {MG} by altering the immune homeostasis mechanisms which prevent emergence of autoimmune diseases such as {MG}. Other drugs, especially certain antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, anesthetics and neuromuscular blockers, have deleterious effects on neuromuscular transmission, resulting in increased weakness in {MG} or {MG}-like symptoms in patients who do not have {MG}, with the latter usually being under medical circumstances such as kidney failure. This review summarizes the drugs which can cause de novo {MG}, {MG} exacerbation or {MG}-like symptoms in nonmyasthenic patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We searched the {MedWatch} drug surveillance system of the Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) from November 1997-February 2002 for reports of statin-associated memory loss. We also reviewed the published literature (using {MEDLINE}) and prescribing information for these drugs. Results. Of the 60 patients identified who had memory loss associated with statins, 36 received simvastatin, 23 atorvastatin, and 1 pravastatin. About 50\% of the patients noted cognitive adverse effects within 2 months of therapy. Fourteen (56\%) of 25 patients noted improvement when the statin was discontinued. Memory loss recurred in four patients who were rechallenged with the drug. None of the 60 reported cognitive test results. Two placebo-controlled trials found no benefits for statins on cognition or disability. One randomized controlled trial of simvastatin found no effects on cerebrospinal amyloid levels. In one small, randomized study, patients receiving statins showed a trend toward lower cognitive performance than those receiving placebo. Five observational studies found a lower risk of dementia among patients receiving statins. Conclusion. Current literature is conflicting with regard to the effects of statins on memory loss. Experimental studies support links between cholesterol intake and amyloid synthesis; observational studies indicate that patients receiving statins have a reduced risk of dementia. However, available prospective studies show no cognitive or antiamyloid benefits for any statin. In addition, case reports raise the possibility that statins, in rare cases, may be associated with cognitive impairment, though causality is not certain.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To review rhabdomyolysis and discuss the role of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A ({HMG}-{CoA}) reductase inhibitors (statins) and their interactions with other agents in precipitating this condition, and to present case reports of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. {DATA} {SOURCE}: Relevant clinical literature was accessed using {MEDLINE} (January 1985-October 2000). The following search terms were used: rhabdomyolysis, adverse events, drug interactions, statins, and {HMG}-{CoA} reductase inhibitors. {DISCUSSION}: Rhabdomyolysis occurs when extensive muscle damage results in the release of cellular contents into systemic circulation. Major complications include acute renal failure, cardiac abnormalities, and compartment syndrome. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis is supportive, with the primary aim of preventing renal and cardiac complications. Statin monotherapy or combination therapy may result in myopathy, which rarely progresses to rhabdomyolysis. The mechanism for drug interactions with the statins involves their property of lipid or water solubility. This characteristic determines the degree of hepatoenteric or renal metabolism of the statins. All statins except pravastatin undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Other pharmacologic agents that are also metabolized via this pathway may interact with the statins and cause rhabdomyolysis. The risk of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is increased significantly when statins are used concomitantly with such drugs as fibrates, cyclosporine, macrolide antibiotics, and azole antifungals. {CONCLUSIONS}: Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but clinically important adverse event of statin monotherapy or combination therapy. Thorough understanding of this condition may help prevent or minimize adverse health outcomes in patients receiving statin therapy.},

Approximately 10\% of this population received simvastatin for a period of ≥2 years. The population on whom this safety analysis is based had a mean age of 50 years; 62\% were men and approximately 27\% had preexisting coronary artery disease. Simvastatin was titrated to the maximal daily dose of 40 mg each evening in 56\% of the study population (last recorded dose). The most frequently reported drug-related clinical adverse experiences were constipation (2.5\%), abdominal pain (2.2\%), flatulence (2.0\%) and headaches (1\%). Persistent elevations of serum transaminase levels {\textgreater}3 times the upper limit of normal were observed in only 1\% of this cohort with only 0.1\% of the total population requiring discontinuation of therapy. There were no clinically apparent episodes of hepatitis. Discontinuation of therapy due to myopathy was extremely rare (0.08\%). Only minimal increases in the frequency of lens opacities (1\%) were observed from baseline to the last lens examination during follow-up, consistent with the expected increase in lens opacity development due to normal aging. Patients who were ≥65 years old had a clinical and laboratory safety profile comparable to the nonelderly population. An evaluation of long-term efficacy indicates that the magnitude of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increases initially observed were maintained after 3 years of chronic treatment with simvastatin. Long-term clinical experience with simvastatin continues to indicate that it is an efficacious and well-tolerated lipidlowering agent. © 1991.},

Objective: To evaluate the safety profile of atorvastatin (Lipitor). Methods: Data were pooled for 21 completed (2502 patients) and 23 ongoing (1769 patients) clinical trials of atorvastatin conducted in {US} and international community- and university-based research centers. In these trials, patients with lipid disorders received atorvastatin at dosages of 10 to 80 mg/d. The majority of patients had moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia and were treated from 4 weeks to more than 24 months. Main Outcome Measures: Transaminase and creatine phosphokinase levels and adverse events were recorded. Results: Atorvastatin was well tolerated; fewer than 2\% of the atorvastatin-treated patients withdrew due to drug- attributable adverse events. The overall adverse event profile for atorvastatin was similar to that observed with other statins. The most common adverse events with atorvastatin as well as with other statins tested were constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Approximately 5\% of atorvastatin-treated patients had serious adverse events; only 2 of these events were possibly associated with treatment. Thirty patients (0.7\%) had confirmed transaminase elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range. Most elevations occurred within 16 weeks of beginning treatment. No patients had a conclusive characterization of drug-induced myopathy. Conclusions: The safety profile of atorvastatin was consistent with that of all statins tested and was similar to that seen in all compounds of this class.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous studies have shown that effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({HDL}-C) may differ among statins. Methods: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-dose study was conducted in 917 hypercholesterolemic patients to compare the efficacy of 80 mg/d simvastatin versus 80 mg/d atorvastatin on {HDL}-C and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I for 24 weeks. Efficacy was assessed as the means of weeks 6 and 12 and weeks 18 and 24. Prespecified subgroups analyzed were patients with low {HDL}-C levels and with the metabolic syndrome. Results: Simvastatin increased {HDL}-C and apo A-I values significantly more than did atorvastatin for the mean of weeks 6 and 12 (8.9\% vs 3.6\% and 4.9\% vs -0.9\%, respectively) and the mean of weeks 18 and 24 (8.3\% vs 4.2\% and 3.7\% vs -1.4\%). These differences were observed across both baseline {HDL}-C subgroups ({\textless}40 mg/{dL}, ≥40 mg/{dL}) and in patients with the metabolic syndrome. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride reductions were greater with atorvastatin. Consecutive elevations {\textgreater}3x the upper limit of normal in alanine aminotransferase ({ALT}) and/or aspartate aminotransferase ({AST}) occurred in significantly fewer patients treated with simvastatin than with atorvostotin (2/453 [0.4\%] vs 13/464 [2.8\%]), with most elevations observed in women taking atorvastatin (11/209 [5.3\%] vs 1/199 [0.5\%] for simvastatin). Conclusions: Simvastatin (80 mg) increased {HDL}-C and apo A-I significantly more than did atorvastatin (80 mg) in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

	abstract = {Statins are considered to be safe, well tolerated and the most efficient drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, one of the main risk factor for atherosclerosis, and therefore they are frequently prescribed medications. The most severe adverse effect of statins is myotoxicity, in the form of myopathy, myalgia, myositis or rhabdomyolysis. Clinical trials commonly define statin toxicity as myalgia or muscle weakness with creatine kinase ({CK}) levels greater than 10 times the normal upper limit. Rhabdomyolysis is the most severe adverse effect of statins, which may result in acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation and death. The exact pathophysiology of statin-induced myopathy is not fully known. Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms may contribute to statin myotoxicity. This review focuses on a number of them. The prevention of statin-related myopathy involves using the lowest statin dose required to achieve therapeutic goals and avoiding polytherapy with drugs known to increase systemic exposure and myopathy risk. Currently, the only effective treatment of statin-induced myopathy is the discontinuation of statin use in patients affected by muscle aches, pains and elevated {CK} levels.

In a retrospective review of 388 bacteremic infections due to aerobic gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus, there was a significant reduction in both overall (6\% vs. 28\%; P=.002) and attributable (3\% vs. 20\%; P=.010) mortality among patients taking statins compared with patients not taking statins. This reduction in mortality persisted in a multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 7.6; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01-57.5).

	abstract = {Introduction: Cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) remains the leading cause of death in industrialized nations. Despite clear evidence of {CVD} risk reduction with {HMG}-{CoA} reductase inhibitors (statins), the side effects of these medications, particularly myopathy, limit their effectiveness. Studies into the mechanisms, aetiology and management of statin myopathy are limited by lack of an internationally agreed clinical definition and tools for assessing outcomes. Currently there is a paucity of evidence to guide the management of patients affected by statin myopathy; with the exception of dose reduction, there is little evidence that other strategies can improve statin tolerance, and even less evidence to suggest these alternate dosing strategies reduce cardiovascular risk.Areas covered: This review will cover current definitions, clinical presentations, risk factors, pathogenesis and management. {PubMed} was searched (English language, to 2014) for key articles pertaining to statin myopathy. This review then briefly describes our experience of managing this condition in a tertiary lipid disorders clinic, in the setting of limited guiding evidence.Expert opinion: Knowledge gaps in the field of statin myopathy are identified and future research directions are suggested. We urge the need for international attention to address this important, but largely neglected clinical problem, that if unresolved will remain an impediment to the effective prevention and treatment of {CVD}. © 2014 Informa {UK}, Ltd.},

Our aim was to develop a process to incorporate the effect of negative controls into the main analysis of a {PSSA}. Methods: Using a previously assessed dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker ({DH}-{CCB}) and loop diuretic {PSSA}, we directly compared the adjusted sequence ratios ({aSRs}) of {DH}-{CCBs} to each of the two negative control index drugs (levothyroxine and angiotensin converting enzyme [{ACE}] inhibitor/angiotensin-2 receptor blocker [{ARB}]) using the ratio of the {aSRs} to estimate a relative {aSR} with a Z test. Further, we utilized the relative {aSR} in stratum-specific analyses and varying exposure windows. Results: The relative {aSR} of {DH}-{CCBs} decreased from 1.87 to 1.72 (95\% {CI} 1.66–1.78) using levothyroxine as a negative control index drug. {ACE} inhibitor/{ARB} negative control index drug resulted in an {aSR} of 1.27 thus reducing the relative {aSR} for {DH}-{CBB} from 1.84 to 1.45 (95\% {CI} 1.41–1.49). When restricting the exposure window to 180 and 90 days, the relative {aSR} of {DH}-{CCBs} increased to 1.68 (95\% {CI} 1.62–1.74) and 1.86 (95\% {CI} 1.78–1.94), respectively, relative to the {ACE} inhibitor/{ARB} negative control index drug. Conclusion: We illustrated how to incorporate negative control index drugs into a {PSSA} and generate relative {aSRs}. Stratum-specific assessments and varying the exposure windows while using negative control index drugs can yield more informative results.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision ({ICD}-10) coding system presents challenges for using administrative data. Recognizing this, we conducted a multistep process to develop {ICD}-10 coding algorithms to define Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities in administrative data and assess the performance of the resulting algorithms. Methods: {ICD}-10 coding algorithms were developed by "translation" of the {ICD}-9-{CM} codes constituting Deyo's (for Charlson comorbidities) and Elixhauser's coding algorithms and by physicians' assessment of the face-validity of selected {ICD}-10 codes. The process of carefully developing {ICD}-10 algorithms also produced modified and enhanced {ICD}-9-{CM} coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities. We then used data on in-patients aged 18 years and older in {ICD}-9-{CM} and {ICD}-10 administrative hospital discharge data from a Canadian health region to assess the comorbidity frequencies and mortality prediction achieved by the original {ICD}-9-{CM} algorithms, the enhanced {ICD}-9-{CM} algorithms, and the new {ICD}-10 coding algorithms. Results: Among 56,585 patients in the {ICD}-9-{CM} data and 58,805 patients in the {ICD}-10 data, frequencies of the 17 Charlson comorbidities and the 30 Elixhauser comorbidities remained generally similar across algorithms. The new {ICD}-10 and enhanced {ICD}-9-{CM} coding algorithms either matched or outperformed the original Deyo and Elixhauser {ICD}-9-{CM} coding algorithms in predicting in-hospital mortality. The C-statistic was 0.842 for Deyo's {ICD}-9-{CM} coding algorithm, 0.860 for the {ICD}-10 coding algorithm, and 0.859 for the enhanced {ICD}-9-{CM} coding algorithm, 0.868 for the original Elixhauser {ICD}-9-{CM} coding algorithm, 0.870 for the {ICD}-10 coding algorithm and 0.878 for the enhanced {ICD}-9-{CM} coding algorithm. Conclusions: These newly developed {ICD}-10 and {ICD}-9-{CM} co-morbidity coding algorithms produce similar estimates of comorbidity prevalence in administrative data, and may outperform existing {ICD}-9-{CM} coding algorithms.

	abstract = {Background: Despite the frequent use of self-controlled methods in pharmacoepidemiological studies, the factors that may bias the estimates from these methods have not been adequately compared in real-world settings. Here, we comparatively examined the impact of a time-varying confounder and its interactions with time-invariant confounders, time trends in exposures and events, restrictions, and misspecification of risk period durations on the estimators from three self-controlled methods. This study analyzed self-controlled case series ({SCCS}), case-crossover ({CCO}) design, and sequence symmetry analysis ({SSA}) using simulated and actual electronic medical records datasets. Methods: We evaluated the performance of the three self-controlled methods in simulated cohorts for the following scenarios: 1) time-invariant confounding with interactions between the confounders, 2) time-invariant and time-varying confounding without interactions, 3) time-invariant and time-varying confounding with interactions among the confounders, 4) time trends in exposures and events, 5) restricted follow-up time based on event occurrence, and 6) patient restriction based on event history. The sensitivity of the estimators to misspecified risk period durations was also evaluated. As a case study, we applied these methods to evaluate the risk of macrolides on liver injury using electronic medical records. Results: In the simulation analysis, time-varying confounding produced bias in the {SCCS} and {CCO} design estimates, which aggravated in the presence of interactions between the time-invariant and time-varying confounders. The {SCCS} estimates were biased by time trends in both exposures and events. Erroneously short risk periods introduced bias to the {CCO} design estimate, whereas erroneously long risk periods introduced bias to the estimates of all three methods. Restricting the follow-up time led to severe bias in the {SSA} estimates. The {SCCS} estimates were sensitive to patient restriction. The case study showed that although macrolide use was significantly associated with increased liver injury occurrence in all methods, the value of the estimates varied. Conclusions: The estimations of the three self-controlled methods depended on various underlying assumptions, and the violation of these assumptions may cause non-negligible bias in the resulting estimates. Pharmacoepidemiologists should select the appropriate self-controlled method based on how well the relevant key assumptions are satisfied with respect to the available data.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Knowledge on adverse effects ({AEs}) related to non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants ({NOACs}) in real-world populations is sparse. Objective: Our objective was to identify signals of potential {AEs} in patients with atrial fibrillation ({AF}) initiating {NOAC} treatment using a hypothesis-free screening approach. Methods: Using the nationwide Danish registries, we identified patients with {AF} initiating dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban between 2011 and 2015 (n = 50,627). Applying a symmetry analysis design, we screened for {AEs} of {NOAC}, as reflected by new drug treatments, incident diagnoses, or procedures. For signals with the lowest number needed for one additional patient to be harmed ({NNTH}), we evaluated whether they likely represented genuine {AEs} or other types of associations. Signals assessed as potential {AEs} were grouped into five categories for analysis of effect modification according to patient and drug characteristics. Results: Of the identified signals, 61 were classified as potential {AEs}. Most signals could be categorized as the following types of {AEs}: bleedings, non-bleeding gastrointestinal symptoms, mental disease, urinary tract disorders, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Older age and first-ever use of anticoagulants was associated with strengthening of all “{NOAC}-adverse effect” associations. Conversely, use of low-dose {NOAC} and apixaban led to attenuation of most associations. Conclusion: Through a symmetry analysis-based hypothesis-free screening of large-scale healthcare databases, we were able to confirm well-established {AEs} of {NOAC} therapy in clinical practice as well as potential {AEs} that deserve further investigation.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Studies have found an association between the use of proton pump inhibitors ({PPIs}) and dementia, but these findings may have been confounded by selection biases. Objective: We used prescription sequence symmetry analysis ({PSSA}) to estimate the sequence ratio ({SR}) between {PPI} use and dementia compared with an active comparator, the use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs). Methods: We conducted a {PSSA} on a nationwide South Korean database between 2002 and 2013. Exposure was defined as new {PPI} users, and outcome was defined as a new dementia diagnosis (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision [{ICD}-10] codes F00-03, F05.1, G30, G31.1, G31.9, G31.82). In this study, we applied the 3-year time window. So the patients who initiated {PPIs} 3 years before or after their first diagnosis of dementia were included. The pairs with the time window {\textless} 6 months were excluded to minimize the potential protopathic bias. The {SR} was calculated as the number of patients first diagnosed with dementia after initiating {PPI} (causal group) divided by the number of patients first diagnosed with dementia before the initiation of {PPI} (non-causal group). The {SR} was adjusted ({aSR}) to avoid the distortion of results due to underlying trends in {PPI} use and dementia diagnosis over time. We calculated 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}) for the {aSR}. The analysis was repeated for initiators of H2RAs. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using 1-, 2-, and 6-year time windows and using the initiation of medication for dementia treatment (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code: N06D). Results: Our results showed that the {aSR} of dementia and {PPIs} (7342 pairs, {aSR} 1.21 [95\% {CI} 1.16–1.27]) was not higher than that for dementia and H2RAs (6170 pairs, {aSR} 1.91 [95\% {CI} 1.80–2.02]). When we used various time windows and restricted the findings to the use of medication for treating dementia, the results were consistent with the main results. Conclusion: The risk of {PPIs} being associated with dementia may be overestimated. Further pharmacoepidemiological studies are needed to identify the risk of dementia with {PPI} use.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate Atorvastatin ({ATO})-associated hepatotoxicity using prescription sequence symmetry analysis ({PSSA}), based on a health insurance database of a Chinese population living in Jiangsu Province, China. Methods: Patients prescribed {ATO} and hepatoprotective drugs in 2017 were identified, and the run-in period was determined based on the “waiting-time” distribution. Adjusted sequence ratio ({ASR}) and 95\% confidence interval (95\% {CI}) were calculated to estimate the risk of {ATO}-associated hepatotoxicity under different time intervals or based on gender and age stratification. Results: A total of 2,549 patients, with 1,518 filling the {ATO} prescription first and 1,031 filling the {ATO} prescription second, were analyzed. After setting the run-in period as 30 days and the time interval as 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 days, the {ASRs} were 1.492 (95\% {CI}: 1.367-1.652), 1.399 (95\% {CI}: 1.308-1.508), 1.280 (95\% {CI}: 1.213-1.357), 1.292 (95\% {CI}: 1.234-1.356), 1.278 (95\% {CI}: 1.226-1.336), and 1.274 (95\% {CI}: 1.229-1.323), respectively. No significant difference was observed between different genders and ages (χ2=0.161, P=0.688; χ2=1.565, P=0.211, respectively). Conclusion: This is the first study conducted in a real-world setting to evaluate the relationship between {ATO} and hepatotoxicity using the {PSSA} in a Chinese population.

	abstract = {Aims: To determine statins' impact on skin infection risk in view of conflicting literature: that statins may reduce infection risk, but are also associated with diabetes mellitus, a risk factor for skin and soft tissue infections ({SSTIs}). Methods: Sequence symmetry analysis was performed on prescription claims (2001–2011) from the Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs to determine the interrelationships between: (i) statins and {SSTIs}; (ii) statins and diabetes; and (iii) diabetes and {SSTIs}; as well as whether statins increased the risk of {SSTIs}, independent of diabetes status. Chi-square tests were performed to detect differences in Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage scores of patients within each interrelationship. Prescriptions for statins, antidiabetic medication, and antistaphylococcal antibiotics were evaluated using nonidentifiable client numbers, prescription dates filled, residential electorates, and pharmaceutical codes. Adjusted sequence ratio and confidence interval were calculated at intervals of 91, 182 and 365 days for sequence symmetry analysis studies. Results: Statins were associated with: (i) significant {SSTI} risk (adjusted sequence ratio {\textgreater} 1; confidence interval {\textgreater}1), (ii) significant diabetes risk, and (iii) diabetic patients had increased risk of {SSTIs}. Diabetic and nondiabetic statin users had significantly increased risks of {SSTIs}, while the influence from socioeconomic status was not significant for each of the 3 relationships. Conclusions: Statins are associated with increased risk of {SSTIs} via direct and indirect mechanisms, probably independent of diabetes or socioeconomic statuses. We believe that clinicians should be aware of the association between statins and {SSTIs}, and, where appropriate, monitor blood glucose levels of statin users.},

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ({STROBE}) initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September, 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of {STROBE} contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the {STROBE} statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles.18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies.A detailed explanation and elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the websites of {PLoS} Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology.

	abstract = {Many cardiovascular drugs have been implicated as causes of depression. With the exception of beta-blockers, few have been studied in formal epidemiologic designs. I present a new approach to such analyses that effectively controls for confounders that are stable over time. I analyzed the exposure histories of 11,244 incident antidepressant users, using the Odense University {PharmacoEpidemiologic} Database. All persons starting both beta-blockers and antidepressants during a predefined period were identified. If beta-blockers do not cause depression, this particular population should show equal numbers of persons starting either drug first. A depression-provoking effect of beta-blockers would generate an excess of persons starting beta-blockers first, that is a nonsymmetrical distribution of prescription orders. Confounders causing the two drugs to be co-prescribed would rarely be expected to affect the symmetry. The initial screening showed nonsymmetrical prescription orders for a wide range of cardiovascular drugs. After adjustment for an increasing incidence of antidepressant prescribing, I found a depression-provoking effect only for angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors (rate ratio = 1.29; 95\% confidence interval = 1.08-1.56) and calcium channel blockers (rate ratio = 1.31; 95\% confidence interval = 1.14-1.51).

	abstract = {Background: The (prescription) sequence symmetry analysis ({PSSA}) design has been used to identify potential prescribing cascade signals by assessing the prescribing sequence of an index drug relative to a marker drug presumed to treat an adverse drug event provoked by the index drug. Objectives: This review aimed to explore the use of the {PSSA} design as a pharmacovigilance tool with a particular focus on the breadth of identified signals and advances in {PSSA} methodology. Methods: We searched Embase, {PubMed}/Medline, Google Scholar, Web of Science and grey literature to identify studies that used the {PSSA} methodology. Two reviewers independently extracted relevant data for each included article. Study characteristics including signals identified, exposure time window, stratified analyses, and use of controls were extracted. Results: We identified 53 studies which reported original results obtained using {PSSA} methodology or quantified the validity of components of the {PSSA} design. Of those, nine studies provided validation metrics showing reasonable sensitivity and high specificity of {PSSA} to identify prescribing cascade signals. We identified 340 unique index drug – marker drug signals published in the {PSSA} literature, representing 281 unique index – marker pharmacological class dyads (i.e., unique fourth-level Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [{ATC}] classification dyads). Commonly observed signals were identified for index drugs acting upon the nervous system (34\%), cardiovascular system (21\%), and blood and blood-forming organs (15\%), and many marker drugs were related to the nervous system (25\%), alimentary tract and metabolism (23\%), cardiovascular system (17\%), and genitourinary system and sex hormones (14\%). Negative controls and positive controls were utilized in 21\% and 13\% of studies, respectively. Conclusions: The {PSSA} methodology has been used in 53 studies worldwide to detect and evaluate over 300 unique prescribing cascades signals. Researchers should consider sensitivity analyses incorporating negative and/or positive controls and additional time windows to evaluate time-varying biases when designing {PSSA} studies.},

All drug dispensings and all secondary care contacts in Denmark during the period 1995–2012 for persons born before 1950 were analyzed by a symmetry design. We analyzed all drug–drug sequences and all drug–disease sequences occurring during the study period. The identified associations were ranked according to the number of outcomes that potentially could be attributed to the exposure. In the main analysis, 29,891,212 incident drug therapies, and 21,300,000 incident diagnoses were included. Out of 186,758 associations tested in the main analysis, 43,575 (23.3\%) showed meaningful effect size. For the top 200 drug–drug associations, 47\% represented unknown associations, 24\% represented known adverse drug reactions, 30\% were explained by mutual indication or reverse causation. For the top 200 drug–disease associations the proportions were 31, 15, and 55\%, respectively.

	abstract = {What is known and objective: Prescription sequence symmetry analyses ({PSSA}) is a ubiquitous tool employed in pharmacoepidemiological research to predict adverse drug reactions ({ADRs}). Several studies have reported the advantage of {PSSA} as a method that can be applied to a large prescription database with computational ease. The objective of this study was to validate New Zealand ({NZ}) prescription database as a potential source for identifying {ADRs} using the {PSSA} method. Methods: We analysed de-identified individual-level prescription data for people aged 65 years and above for the period 2005 to 2014 from the pharmaceutical collections supplied by the {NZ} Ministry of Health. We selected six positive controls that have been previously investigated and reported for causing {ADRs}. The six positive controls identified were amiodarone (repeated twice), frusemide, simvastatin, lithium and fluticasone. Amiodarone and lithium have been reported to induce thyroid dysfunction. Simvastatin reported to cause muscle cramps while fluticasone is well documented to cause oral candidiasis. Thyroxine was identified as a marker drug to treat hypothyroidism associated with amiodarone and lithium. Carbimazole was identified as a marker drug to treat hyperthyroidism associated with amiodarone use. Quinine sulphate was identified as a marker drug to treat muscle cramps associated with statins. In addition, we also analysed six negative controls that are unlikely to be associated with {ADRs}. The main outcome measure is to determine associations with {ADRs} using adjusted sequence ratios ({ASR}), and 95\% confidence intervals. Results and discussion: Our analyses confirmed a significant signal for all six positive controls. Significant positive associations were noted for amiodarone [{ASR} = 3·57, 95\% {CI} (3·17–4·02)], and lithium chloride induced hypothyroidism [{ASR} = 3·43, 95\% {CI} (2·55–4·70)]. Amiodarone was also strongly associated with hyperthyroidism [{ASR} = 8·81 95\% {CI} (5·86–13·77)]. Simvastatin was associated with muscle cramps [{ASR} = 1·69, 95\% {CI} (1·61–1·77)]. Fluticasone was positively associated with oral candidiasis [{ASR} = 2·34, 95\% {CI} (2·19–2·50)]. Frusemide was associated with hypokalaemia [{ASR} = 2·94, 95\% {CI} (2·83–3·05]). No strong associations were noted for the negative pairs. It is important to highlight that {PSSA} automatically controls for all confounding factors including unknown and unmeasured confounding variables, plus the effect of temporal trend in prescriptions, and hence allows a more robust {ADR} detection especially when confounding factors are difficult to determine or measure. What is new and conclusion: New Zealand prescription database can be a potential source to identify {ADRs} engaging the {PSSA} method, and this could complement pharmacovigilance surveillance in {NZ}. The {PSSA} can be an important method for post-marketing surveillance and monitoring of {ADRs} which have relatively short latency. However, the predictive validity of {PSSA} will be compromised in certain scenarios, particularly when sample size is small, when new drugs are in the market and data are sparse.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To assess adverse events with use of antiepileptic drugs ({AEDs}) by the method of sequence symmetry analysis. Methods: We used data from two population-based sources in Funen County, Denmark (population 2006: 479 000); prescription data from Odense University Pharmacoepidemiological Database ({OPED}) for the period of 1 August 1990-31 December 2006, and diagnoses from the County Hospital register for the period of 1994-2006 to perform sequence symmetry analysis. The method assesses the distribution of disease entities and prescription of other drugs ({ODs}), before and after initiation of {AED} treatment, as asymmetry in these distributions may indicate adverse events of {AED} use. Crude and adjusted sequence ratios ({ASRs}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) were calculated. Results: We identified 24 882 incident {AED} users during the study period. Analysis with predefined drugs and diagnoses detected known {AED} adverse events of unspecific (constipation, nausea) and specific character (hyponatraemia, osteoporosis). Unanticipated signals from analysis without any preselection of drugs and diagnoses were the association of topiramate with dopaminergic agents ({ASR} 10.4; 95\%{CI} 1.5-448), of gabapentin with glaucoma ({ASR} 8.0; 95\%{CI} 1.1-355) and of valproic acid with hypothyroidism ({ASR} 8.0; 95\%{CI} 1.1-355). Conclusions: Few unsuspected adverse {AED} effects were recognized in our study. Sequence symmetry analysis is a feasible method of monitoring for adverse {AED} effects.

	abstract = {Background: The use of diuretics, statins, and inhaled long-acting β2-agonists ({LABAs}) is linked to muscle cramps but largely by anecdotal evidence. This study sought population-level data to better evaluate these associations. Methods: Linked health care databases containing prescribing information (December 1, 2000, to November 30, 2008) about 4.2 million residents of British Columbia, Canada, were evaluated using sequence symmetry analysis to determine in adults 50 years or older whether new quinine prescriptions (initiations of cramp treatment) increase in the year following diuretic, statin, or {LABA} starts. The statistic of interest was the sequence ratio: the number of quinine starts in the year following index drug introduction compared with the number of quinine starts in the preceding year (adjusted for age and time trends in population prescribing). Results: Adjusted sequence ratios (95\% {CIs}) for the 3 drug classes were 1.47 (1.33-1.63 [P{\textless}.001]) for diuretics, 1.16 (1.04-1.29 [P=.004]) for statins, and 2.42 (2.02-2.89 [P{\textless}.001]) for {LABAs}. For diuretic subclasses, adjusted sequence ratios (95\% {CIs}) were 2.12 (1.61-2.78 [P{\textless}.001]) for potassium sparing, 1.48 (1.29-1.68 [P{\textless}.001]) for thiazidelike, and 1.20 (1.00-1.44 [P=.07]) for loop. For {LABA} subclasses, adjusted sequence ratios (95\% {CIs}) were 2.17 (1.56-3.02) for {LABAs} alone and 2.55 (2.06-3.12) for {LABAs}-corticosteroids (P{\textless}.001 for both). Conclusions: Cramp treatment was substantially more likely in the year following introduction of {LABAs}, potassium-sparing diuretics, or thiazidelike diuretics, and 60.3\% of quinine users (individuals experiencing cramp) received at least 1 of these medications during a 13-year period. In contrast, statin and loop diuretic associations were small. Physicians should be mindful that the use of these medications may worsen symptoms in patients experiencing nocturnal leg cramps. ©2012 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: The efficacy and safety of statins have been studied in a number of clinical trials and epidemiological studies. In recent years, the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ({MHRA}) has assessed the evidence available on the following adverse reactions associated with the use of statins: sleep disturbances, memory loss, micturition disorders (problems with urination), sexual disturbances, depression, and interstitial pneumopathy. However, the association between statin use and the risk of these adverse reactions remains unclear. To examine the association between statin use and the risk of lower urinary tract symptoms ({LUTS}) or the disorder causing {LUTS}, we carried out data mining using a prescription database. Methods: A large organized database of prescriptions constructed by a database vendor was used in the study. Symmetry analysis was used to identify the risk of {LUTS} after using statins over the period January 2006 to August 2013. Statin use in combination with drugs administered for storage {LUTS} was examined by prescription sequence symmetry analysis ({PSSA}). Results: A significant association between statins and drugs for storage {LUTS} was found, with adjusted sequence ratios ({ASRs}) of 1.21 (95\% {CI}, 1.00-1.46), 1.19 (95\% {CI}, 1.04-1.38), and 1.17 (95\% {CI}, 1.05-1.30) for intervals of 91, 182, and 365 days, respectively. In the analyses of individual statins, significant associations were found only for pravastatin. Significant associations with individual drugs for storage {LUTS} were found for solifenacin succinate with {ASRs} of 1.36 (95\% {CI}, 1.02-1.81), 1.48 (95\% {CI}, 1.19-1.84), and 1.47 (95\% {CI}, 1.25-1.73) for intervals of 91, 182, and 365 days, for flavoxate hydrochloride with an {ASR} of 1.56 (95\% {CI}, 1.13-2.17) at an interval of 182 days, and for oxybutynin hydrochloride with {ASRs} of 2.06 (95\% {CI}, 1.11-3.94) and 1.71 (95\% {CI}, 1.09-2.72) at intervals of 182 and 365 days. Significant associations with gender were found only in females with {ASRs} of 1.25 (95\% {CI}, 1.04-1.51) and 1.23 (95\% {CI}, 1.07-1.41) at intervals of 182 and 365days, respectively.

	abstract = {Background: Particular interest has been generated regarding the possible influence of statin use on sleep quality. However, no conclusive evidence exists that a particular statin is more likely to be associated with sleep disturbances versus others. It remains uncertain whether different statins produce different risks for sleep disturbance. Objective: To examine the association between statin use and the risk of sleep disturbances, we conducted data mining using the {US} Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System ({FAERS}) and a large organized database of prescriptions constructed by a database vendor (Japan Medical Information Research Institute, Inc. Japan). Methods: Relevant reports in the {FAERS} were identified and analyzed. Data from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2013 were included in this study. The reporting odds ratio ({ROR}) was used to detect spontaneous report signals, calculated using the case/non-case method. For the {ROR}, a signal was detected if the lower limit of 95 \% two-sided confidence interval (95 \% {CI}) was {\textgreater}1. Additionally, signal detection using the {IC} was conducted using the {IC}025 metric, a lower limit of the 95 \% {CI} of the {IC}, where a signal is detected if the {IC}025 value exceeds 0. In addition, symmetry analysis was used to identify the risk of insomnia after using statins over the period of January 2006 to August 2013. Results: In the analyses of the {FAERS} database, significant signals for sleep disturbances including disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep, sleep disorders {NEC}, sleeping disorders due to a general medical condition, and parasomnias were found. In the prescription sequence symmetry analysis, a significant association between statin use and hypnotic drug use was found, with adjusted sequence ratios of 1.14 (1.03-1.26), 1.20 (1.11-1.29), and 1.18 (1.11-1.25) at intervals of 91, 182, and 365 days, respectively. Conclusion: Multi-methodological approaches using different algorithms and databases strongly suggest that statin use is associated with an increased risk for sleep disturbances including insomnia. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

At present, this potential has not been fully realized, because many patients at heightened risk are not being treated with these drugs. There is a well documented under-use of statins in clinical practice. Statins have proven to be extremely safe in the vast majority of patients receiving them. Few significant side effects were observed in clinical trials, and post-marketing reports of adverse events have been very limited when considered in comparison to the very large number of persons safely receiving these drugs. Even so, these drugs are not entirely free of side effects, and as for all drags, they should be used appropriately and judiciously. This advisory encourages the appropriate use of statins while pointing out the possibility of side effects in certain patients. If statins are used with appropriate caution in these selected patients, the likelihood of developing clinically important myopathy should be substantially reduced. (See Tables 1 and 2.).},

We refine the definition to encompass both recognized and unrecognized {ADEs} because they can both contribute to problematic prescribing practices. In addition, we discuss that although prescribing cascades are most commonly viewed as problematic, they may be appropriate and therapeutically beneficial in certain clinical situations. We differentiate between appropriate and problematic prescribing cascades by adopting a similar approach to the framework proposed in the highly acclaimed King's Fund report Polypharmacy and Medicines Optimization. Practical considerations are also presented to aid clinicians in preventing the propagation of problematic prescribing cascades within their clinical practice. Providing new perspectives on the scope and appropriateness of the prescribing cascade concept is an important step in describing clinically relevant cascades and in encouraging safe prescribing practices.

Clinicians answered questions about the diagnostic criteria, estimated incidence of {SAS}, and choice of treatment for patients with {SAS}.{ResultsOverall}, 810 clinicians (78\% cardiologists) completed the survey. An average of 72\% of patients with potential {SAS} were reported to present with muscle-related symptoms (range across countries [{RAC}] 50-87\%) that could be {SAMS}. Clinicians took a range of steps to confirm {SAMS} in these patients, including discontinuation of statin (average 59\%; {RAC} 48-67\%); re-challenge with ≥2 statins (average 74\%; {RAC} 60-85\%); modification of statin regimen (average 76\%; {RAC} 65-85\%); or a combination of these steps.

	abstract = {One in 4 Americans {\textgreater}40 years of age takes a statin to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and other complications of atherosclerotic disease. The most effective statins produce a mean reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 55\% to 60\% at the maximum dosage, and 6 of the 7 marketed statins are available in generic form, which makes them affordable for most patients. Primarily using data from randomized controlled trials, supplemented with observational data where necessary, this scientific statement provides a comprehensive review of statin safety and tolerability. The review covers the general patient population, as well as demographic subgroups, including the elderly, children, pregnant women, East Asians, and patients with specific conditions such as chronic disease of the kidney and liver, human immunodeficiency viral infection, and organ transplants. The risk of statin-induced serious muscle injury, including rhabdomyolysis, is {\textgreater}0.1\%, and the risk of serious hepatotoxicity is ?0.001\%. The risk of statin-induced newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus is ?0.2\% per year of treatment, depending on the underlying risk of diabetes mellitus in the population studied. In patients with cerebrovascular disease, statins possibly increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke; however, they clearly produce a greater reduction in the risk of atherothrombotic stroke and thus total stroke, as well as other cardiovascular events. There is no convincing evidence for a causal relationship between statins and cancer, cataracts, cognitive dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, erectile dysfunction, or tendonitis. In {US} clinical practices, roughly 10\% of patients stop taking a statin because of subjective complaints, most commonly muscle symptoms without raised creatine kinase. In contrast, in randomized clinical trials, the difference in the incidence of muscle symptoms without significantly raised creatinine kinase in statin-treated compared with placebo-treated participants is {\textgreater}1\%, and it is even smaller (0.1\%) for patients who discontinued treatment because of such muscle symptoms. This suggests that muscle symptoms are usually not caused by pharmacological effects of the statin. Restarting statin therapy in these patients can be challenging, but it is important, especially in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events, for whom prevention of these events is a priority. Overall, in patients for whom statin treatment is recommended by current guidelines, the benefits greatly outweigh the risks.},

Demographic, medical condition, and prescribed medicine information of adults 40 years and older between 2002 and 2013 were obtained from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey database. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: Estimated trends in statin use, total expenditure, and {OOP} share among the general adult population, those with established {ASCVD}, and those at risk for {ASCVD}. Costs were adjusted to 2013 {US} dollars using the Gross Domestic Product Index. {RESULTS}: From 2002 to 2013, more than 157 000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey participants were eligible for the study (mean [{SD}] age, 57.7 [39.9] years; 52.1\% female). Overall, statin use among {US} adults 40 years of age and older in the general population increased 79.8\% from 21.8 million individuals (17.9\%) in 2002-2003 (134 million prescriptions) to 39.2 million individuals (27.8\%) in 2012-2013 (221 million prescriptions). Among those with established {ASCVD}, statin use was 49.8\% and 58.1\% in 2002-2003 and 2012-2013, respectively, and less than one-third were prescribed as a high-intensity dose. Across all subgroups, statin use was significantly lower in women (odds ratio, 0.81; 95\% {CI}, 0.79-0.85), racial/ethnic minorities (odds ratio, 0.65; 95\% {CI}, 0.61-0.70), and the uninsured (odds ratio, 0.33; 95\% {CI}, 0.30-0.37). The proportion of generic statin use increased substantially, from 8.4\% in 2002-2003 to 81.8\% in 2012-2013. Gross domestic product-adjusted total cost for statins decreased from \$17.2 billion ({OOP} cost, \$7.6 billion) in 2002-2003 to \$16.9 billion ({OOP} cost, \$3.9 billion) in 2012-2013, and the mean annual {OOP} costs for patients decreased from \$348 to \$94. Brand-name statins were used by 18.2\% of statin users, accounting for 55\% of total costs in 2012-2013. {CONCLUSION} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: Statin use increased substantially in the last decade among {US} adults, although the uptake was suboptimal in high-risk groups. While total and {OOP} expenditures associated with statins decreased, further substitution of brand-name to generic statins may yield more savings.},

	abstract = {Background: Studies evaluating titration of antihypertensive medication using self-monitoring give contradictory findings and the precise place of telemonitoring over self-monitoring alone is unclear. The {TASMINH}4 trial aimed to assess the efficacy of self-monitored blood pressure, with or without telemonitoring, for antihypertensive titration in primary care, compared with usual care. Methods: This study was a parallel randomised controlled trial done in 142 general practices in the {UK}, and included hypertensive patients older than 35 years, with blood pressure higher than 140/90 mm Hg, who were willing to self-monitor their blood pressure. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to self-monitoring blood pressure (self-montoring group), to self-monitoring blood pressure with telemonitoring (telemonitoring group), or to usual care (clinic blood pressure; usual care group). Randomisation was by a secure web-based system. Neither participants nor investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was clinic measured systolic blood pressure at 12 months from randomisation. Primary analysis was of available cases. The trial is registered with {ISRCTN}, number {ISRCTN} 83571366. Findings: 1182 participants were randomly assigned to the self-monitoring group (n=395), the telemonitoring group (n=393), or the usual care group (n=394), of whom 1003 (85\%) were included in the primary analysis. After 12 months, systolic blood pressure was lower in both intervention groups compared with usual care (self-monitoring, 137·0 [{SD} 16·7] mm Hg and telemonitoring, 136·0 [16·1] mm Hg vs usual care, 140·4 [16·5]; adjusted mean differences vs usual care: self-monitoring alone, −3·5 mm Hg [95\% {CI} −5·8 to −1·2]; telemonitoring, −4·7 mm Hg [–7·0 to −2·4]). No difference between the self-monitoring and telemonitoring groups was recorded (adjusted mean difference −1·2 mm Hg [95\% {CI} −3·5 to 1·2]). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses including multiple imputation. Adverse events were similar between all three groups. Interpretation: Self-monitoring, with or without telemonitoring, when used by general practitioners to titrate antihypertensive medication in individuals with poorly controlled blood pressure, leads to significantly lower blood pressure than titration guided by clinic readings. With most general practitioners and many patients using self-monitoring, it could become the cornerstone of hypertension management in primary care.

The therapeutic intensity score ({TIS}) is a summary measure that accounts for the number of medications and the relative doses a patient received, but its relationship to {BP} change and its utility as a method to project dosing equivalence has not been reported. We conducted a prospective, single center, randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of Joint National Committee ({JNC}) 7 compliant treatment with more intensive ({\textless}120/80 mm Hg) {BP} goals on left ventricular structure and function in hypertensive patients with echocardiographically determined subclinical heart disease who were treated over a 12-month period. For this preplanned subanalysis, we sought to compare changes in {BP} over time with changes in {TIS}. Antihypertensive therapy was open label. {TIS} and {BP} were determined at 3-month intervals with titration of medication doses as needed to achieve targeted {BP}. Mixed linear models defined antihypertensive medication {TIS} as an independent variable and change in systolic {BP} as an outcome measure, while controlling for gender, age, baseline {BP}, and treatment group. A total of 123 patients (mean age 49.4 ± 8.2 years; 66\% female; 95.1\% African-American) were enrolled and 88 completed the protocol. For each single point increase in total antihypertensive {TIS}, a 14.5 (95\% confidence interval: 11.5, 17.4) mm Hg decrease in systolic {BP} was noted (15.5 [95\% confidence interval: 13.0, 18.0] mm Hg for those who completed the trial).

	abstract = {Instrumental variable analyses are increasingly used in epidemiologic studies. For dichotomous exposures and outcomes, the typical 2-stage least squares approach produces risk difference estimates rather than relative risk estimates and is criticized for assuming normally distributed errors. Using 2 example drug safety studies evaluated in 3 cohorts from Pennsylvania (1994-2003) and British Columbia, Canada (1996-2004), the authors compared instrumental variable techniques that yield relative risk and risk difference estimates and that are appropriate for dichotomous exposures and outcomes. Methods considered include probit structural equation models, 2-stage logistic models, and generalized method of moments estimators. Employing these methods, in the first study the authors observed relative risks ranging from 0.41 to 0.58 and risk differences ranging from -1.41 per 100 to -1.28 per 100; in the second, they observed relative risks of 1.38-2.07 and risk differences of 7.53-8.94; and in the third, they observed relative risks of 1.45-1.59 and risk differences of 3.88-4.84. The 2-stage logistic models showed standard errors up to 40\% larger than those of the instrumental variable probit model. Generalized method of moments estimation produced substantially the same results as the 2-stage logistic method. Few substantive differences among the methods were observed, despite their reliance on distinct assumptions. © The Author 2008. Published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

In parallel cohort studies of outpatient and inpatient {COVID}-19-diagnosed adults with hypertension, we assessed associations between antihypertensive exposure ({ACEI}/{ARB} vs. non-{ACEI}/{ARB} antihypertensives, as well as between {ACEI}- vs. {ARB}) at the time of {COVID}-19 diagnosis, using electronic health record data from {PCORnet} health systems. The primary outcomes were all-cause hospitalization or death (outpatient cohort) or all-cause death (inpatient), analyzed via Cox regression weighted by inverse probability of treatment weights. From February 2020 through December 9, 2020, 11,246 patients (3477 person-years) and 2200 patients (777 person-years) were included from 17 health systems in outpatient and inpatient cohorts, respectively. There were 1015 all-cause hospitalization or deaths in the outpatient cohort (incidence, 29.2 events per 100 person-years), with no significant difference by {ACEI}/{ARB} use (adjusted {HR} 1.01; 95\% {CI} 0.88, 1.15). In the inpatient cohort, there were 218 all-cause deaths (incidence, 28.1 per 100 person-years) and {ACEI}/{ARB} exposure was associated with reduced death (adjusted {HR}, 0.76; 95\% {CI}, 0.57, 0.99). {ACEI}, versus {ARB} exposure, was associated with higher risk of hospitalization in the outpatient cohort, but no difference in all-cause death in either cohort. There was no evidence of effect modification across pre-specified baseline characteristics. Our results suggest {ACEI} and {ARB} exposure have no detrimental effect on hospitalizations and may reduce death among hypertensive patients diagnosed with {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {Background: Individuals aged 65 and older face unique barriers to adoption of telehealth, and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has provided a “natural experiment” in how to meet the health needs of older patients remotely. Physician perspectives on practical considerations surrounding telehealth adoption, motivations of use, and reasons for nonuse are necessary to inform the future of healthcare delivery. The objective is to understand the experiences of physicians using telemedicine for older patients. Methods: From September to November 2020, we conducted 30-min semi-structured interviews using purposeful sampling to identify and enroll participants from diverse settings. We included 48 U.S.-based physicians (geriatrician, n = 18, primary care, n = 15, emergency, n = 15) from all geographic regions, rural–urban and academic/community settings. Audio-recorded interviews were professionally transcribed and analyzed using framework analysis. Major themes and subthemes were identified. Results: Participants had a median (interquartile range) age of 37.5 (34–44.5), 27 (56\%) were women. Five major themes emerged: (1) telehealth uptake was rapid and iterative, (2) telehealth improved the safety of medical care, (3) use cases were specialty-specific (for geriatricians and primary care physicians telehealth substituted for in-person visits; for emergency physicians it primarily supplemented in-person visits), (4) physicians altered clinical care to overcome older patient barriers to telehealth use, and (5) telehealth use among physicians declined in mid-April 2020, due primarily to patient needs and administrator preferences, not physician factors. Conclusion: In this qualitative analysis, physicians reported a rapid, iterative uptake of telehealth and attenuation of use as coronavirus disease 2019 prevalence declined. Physician experiences during the pandemic can inform interventions and policies to help buoy telehealth for ongoing healthcare delivery and ensure its accessibility for older Americans.},

	abstract = {Electronic health records ({EHRs}) are widely used in epidemiological research, but the validity of the results is dependent upon the assumptions made about the healthcare system, the patient, and the provider. In this review, we identify four overarching challenges in using {EHR}-based data for epidemiological analysis, with a particular emphasis on threats to validity. These challenges include representativeness of the {EHR} to a target population, the availability and interpretability of clinical and non-clinical data, and missing data at both the variable and observation levels. Each challenge reveals layers of assumptions that the epidemiologist is required to make, from the point of patient entry into the healthcare system, to the provider documenting the results of the clinical exam and follow-up of the patient longitudinally; all with the potential to bias the results of analysis of these data. Understanding the extent of as well as remediating potential biases requires a variety of methodological approaches, from traditional sensitivity analyses and validation studies, to newer techniques such as natural language processing. Beyond methods to address these challenges, it will remain crucial for epidemiologists to engage with clinicians and informaticians at their institutions to ensure data quality and accessibility by forming multidisciplinary teams around specific research projects.},

	volume = {11},
	doi = {10.2196/29880},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} While telemedicine has been expanding over the past decade, the {COVID}-19-related restrictions regarding in-person care have led to unprecedented levels of telemedicine utilization. To the authors' knowledge, no studies to date have quantitatively analyzed both national and regional trends in telemedicine utilization during the pandemic, both of which have key implications for informing health policy. {OBJECTIVE} This study aimed to investigate how trends in telemedicine utilization changed across the course of the {COVID}-19 pandemic. {METHODS} Using data from doxy.me, the largest free telemedicine platform, and the {NIH} (National Institutes of Health) Clinical Center, the largest clinical research hospital in the United States, we assessed changes in total telemedicine minutes, new provider registrations, monthly sessions, and average session length from March to November 2020. We also conducted a state-level analysis of how telemedicine expansion differed by region. {RESULTS} National telemedicine utilization peaked in April 2020 at 291 million minutes and stabilized at 200 to 220 million monthly minutes from May to November 2020. Surges were strongest in New England and weakest in the South and West. Greater telemedicine expansion during the {COVID}-19 pandemic was geographically associated with fewer {COVID}-19 cases per capita. The nature of telemedicine visits also changed, as the average monthly visits per provider doubled and the average visit length decreased by 60\%. {CONCLUSIONS} The {COVID}-19 pandemic led to an abrupt and subsequently sustained uptick in telemedicine utilization. Regional and institute-level differences in telemedicine utilization should be further investigated to inform policy and procedures for sustaining meaningful telemedicine use in clinical practice.},

To evaluate how, we measure ambulatory clinician {EHR} use in the United States throughout the {COVID}-19 pandemic. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We use {EHR} meta-data from ambulatory care clinicians in 366 health systems using the Epic {EHR} system in the United States from December 2019 to December 2020. We used descriptive statistics for clinician {EHR} use including active-use time across clinical activities, time after-hours, and messages received. Multivariable regression to evaluate total and after-hours {EHR} work adjusting for daily volume and organizational characteristics, and to evaluate the association between messages and {EHR} time. {RESULTS}: Clinician time spent in the {EHR} per day dropped at the onset of the pandemic but had recovered to higher than prepandemic levels by July 2020. Time spent actively working in the {EHR} after-hours showed similar trends. These differences persisted in multivariable models. In-Basket messages received increased compared with prepandemic levels, with the largest increase coming from messages from patients, which increased to 157\% of the prepandemic average. Each additional patient message was associated with a 2.32-min increase in {EHR} time per day (P {\textless} .001). {DISCUSSION}: Clinicians spent more total and after-hours time in the {EHR} in the latter half of 2020 compared with the prepandemic period.

Patient preferences for telehealth or in-person care are an important factor in defining the role of telehealth in the postpandemic world. Objective: To ascertain patient preferences for video visits after the ongoing {COVID}-19 public health emergency and to identify patient perceptions of the value of video visits and the role of out-of-pocket cost in changing patient preference for each visit modality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study was conducted using a nationally representative sample of adult members of the {RAND} American Life Panel. The data were obtained from the American Life Panel Omnibus Survey, which was fielded between March 8 and 19, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Preferences for video visits vs in-person care were analyzed in the survey. The first question was about participants' baseline preference for an in-person or a video visit for a nonemergency health issue. The second question entailed choosing between the preferred visit modality with a cost of \$30 and another modality with a cost of \$10. Questions also involved demographic characteristics, experience with video visits, willingness to use video visits, and preferences for the amount of telehealth use after the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 2080 of 3391 sampled panel members completed the survey (participation rate, 61.3\%). Participants in the weighted sample had a mean ({SE}) age of 51.1 (0.67) years and were primarily women (1079 [51.9\%]). Most participants (66.5\%) preferred at least some video visits in the future, but when faced with a choice between an in-person or a video visit for a health care encounter that could be conducted either way, more than half of respondents (53.0\%) preferred an in-person visit. Among those who initially preferred an in-person visit when out-of-pocket costs were not a factor, 49.8\% still preferred in-person care and 23.5\% switched to a video visit when confronted with higher relative costs for in-person care. In contrast, among those who initially preferred a video visit, only 18.9\% still preferred a video visit and 61.7\% switched to in-person visit when confronted with higher relative costs for video visits. Conclusions and Relevance: This survey study found that participants were generally willing to use video visits but preferred in-person care, and those who preferred video visits were more sensitive to paying out-of-pocket cost. These results suggest that understanding patient preferences will help identify telehealth's role in future health care delivery..},

Objective: To describe the changes in management, control, and outcomes in older people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated with the shift from in-person to virtual visits. Design and Participants: In veterans aged ≥ 65 years with T2D, we assessed the rates of visits (in person, virtual), A1c measurements, antidiabetic deintensification/intensification, {ER} visits and hospitalizations (for hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, other causes), and A1c level, in March 2020 and April–November 2020 (pandemic period). We used negative binomial regression to assess change over time (reference: pre-pandemic period, July 2018 to February 2020), by baseline Charlson Comorbidity Index ({CCI}; {\textgreater} 2 vs. {\textless}= 2) and A1c level. Key Results: Among 740,602 veterans (mean age 74.2 [{SD} 6.6] years), there were 55\% (95\% {CI} 52–58\%) fewer in-person visits, 821\% (95\% {CI} 793–856\%) more virtual visits, 6\% (95\% {CI} 1–11\%) fewer A1c measurements, and 14\% (95\% {CI} 10–17\%) more treatment intensification during the pandemic, relative to baseline. Patients with {CCI} {\textgreater} 2 had a 14\% (95\% {CI} 12–16\%) smaller relative increase in virtual visits than those with {CCI} {\textless}= 2. We observed a seasonality of A1c level and treatment modification, but no association of either with the pandemic. After a decrease at the beginning of the pandemic, there was a rebound in other-cause (but not hypo- and hyperglycemia-related) {ER} visits and hospitalizations from June to November 2020. Conclusion: Despite a shift to virtual visits and a decrease in A1c measurement during the pandemic, we observed no association with A1c level or short-term T2D-related outcomes, providing some reassurance about the adequacy of virtual visits. Further studies should assess the longer-term effects of shifting to virtual visits in different populations to help individualize care, improve efficiency, and maintain appropriate care while reducing overuse.},

The present study looks at the online conversation regarding telemedicine at the beginning of the pandemic and one year later. The Technology Acceptance Model is utilized to explain the findings. Methods: Brandwatch and {NUVI} software captured social mentions on Twitter regarding telemedicine during the beginning of the pandemic (March 15, 2020–April 20, 2020) and one year later (March 12, 2021–April 19, 2021). {SAS} text-mining software analyzed the social mentions and organized them into ten unique topics for each time period. The research team analyzed the topics and organized them into themes. A network analysis was also performed to examine structure and influence within the network. Results: In March–April 2020, the themes focused on the use of telehealth in general, telehealth for mental health applications, and Medicare covering telehealth services. In March–April 2021, the themes focused on news events regarding telehealth and the rise in prominence of telehealth services. The network analysis shows a shift in the distribution of telehealth information among influential accounts and reveals that the network became more connected, with a change in the control of information spread. Conclusions: Technology Acceptance Model explains the social acceptance and spread of telemedicine. The transition in the conversation about telemedicine suggests a pattern of greater system use consistent with the Technology Acceptance Model. Telemedicine may have greatly increased in use because of the pandemic, but data suggests that its use may persist after the pandemic subsides.},

Objectives: To document patterns and costs of ambulatory care in the {US} before and during the initial stage of the pandemic and to assess how patient, practitioner, community, and {COVID}-19-related factors are associated with telehealth adoption. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a cohort study of working-age persons continuously enrolled in private health plans from March 2019 through June 2020. The comparison periods were March to June in 2019 and 2020. Claims data files were provided by Blue Health Intelligence, an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Data analysis was performed from June to October 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ambulatory encounters (in-person and telehealth) and allowed charges, stratified by characteristics derived from enrollment files, practitioner claims, and community characteristics linked to the enrollee's zip code. Results: A total of 36568010 individuals (mean [{SD}] age, 35.71 [18.77] years; 18466557 female individuals [50.5\%]) were included in the analysis. In-person contacts decreased by 37\% (from 1.63 to 1.02 contacts per enrollee) from 2019 to 2020. During 2020, telehealth visits (0.32 visit per person) accounted for 23.6\% of all interactions compared with 0.3\% of contacts in 2019. When these virtual contacts were added, the overall {COVID}-19 era patient and practitioner visit rate was 18\% lower than that in 2019 (1.34 vs 1.64 visits per person). Behavioral health encounters were far more likely than medical contacts to take place virtually (46.1\% vs 22.1\%). {COVID}-19 prevalence in an area was associated with higher use of telehealth; patients from areas within the top quintile of {COVID}-19 prevalence during the week of their encounter were 1.34 times more likely to have a telehealth visit compared with those in the lowest quintile (the reference category). Persons living in areas with limited social resources were less likely to use telehealth (most vs least socially advantaged neighborhoods, 27.4\% vs 19.9\% usage rates). Per enrollee medical care costs decreased by 15\% between 2019 and 2020 (from \$358.32 to \$306.04 per person per month). During 2020, those with 1 or more {COVID}-19-related service (1470721 members) had more than 3 times the medical costs (\$1701 vs \$544 per member per month) than those without {COVID}-19-related services. Persons with 1 or more telehealth visits in 2020 had considerably higher costs than persons having only in-person ambulatory contacts (\$2214.10 vs \$1337.78 for the {COVID}-19-related subgroup and \$735.87 vs \$456.41 for the non-{COVID}-19 subgroup). Conclusions and Relevance: This study of a large cohort of patients enrolled in {US} health plans documented patterns of care at the onset of {COVID}-19. The findings are relevant to policy makers, payers, and practitioners as they manage the use of telehealth during the pandemic and afterward.},

	doi = {10.2196/18961},
	abstract = {Background: As the novel coronavirus disease ({COVID}-19) is widely spreading across the United States, there is a concern about the overloading of the nation’s health care capacity. The expansion of telehealth services is expected to deliver timely care for the initial screening of symptomatic patients while minimizing exposure in health care facilities, to protect health care providers and other patients. However, it is currently unknown whether {US} hospitals have the telehealth capacity to meet the increasing demand and needs of patients during this pandemic. Objective: We investigated the population-level internet search volume for telehealth (as a proxy of population interest and demand) with the number of new {COVID}-19 cases and the proportion of hospitals that adopted a telehealth system in all {US} states. Methods: We used internet search volume data from Google Trends to measure population-level interest in telehealth and telemedicine between January 21, 2020 (when the first {COVID}-19 case was reported), and March 18, 2020. Data on {COVID}-19 cases in the United States were obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resources Center. We also used data from the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey to estimate the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (including telemedicine and electronic visits) and those with the capability of telemedicine intensive care unit (tele-{ICU}). Pearson correlation was used to examine the relations of population search volume for telehealth and telemedicine (composite score) with the cumulative numbers of {COVID}-19 cases in the United States during the study period and the proportion of hospitals with telehealth and tele-{ICU} capabilities. Results: We found that {US} population–level interest in telehealth increased as the number of {COVID}-19 cases increased, with a strong correlation (r=0.948, P{\textless}.001). We observed a higher population-level interest in telehealth in the Northeast and West census region, whereas the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth was higher in the Midwest region. There was no significant association between population interest and the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (r=0.055, P=.70) nor hospitals having tele-{ICU} capability (r=–0.073, P=.61). Conclusions: As the number of {COVID}-19 cases increases, so does the {US} population’s interest in telehealth. However, the level of population interest did not correlate with the proportion of hospitals providing telehealth services in the United States, suggesting that increased population demand may not be met with the current telehealth capacity. Telecommunication infrastructures in {US} hospitals may lack the capability to address the ongoing health care needs of patients with other health conditions. More practical investment is needed to deploy the telehealth system rapidly against the impending patient surge.},

The evolution of digital health is entwined with federal regulation and policy. Whether considering what is or is not a medical device, the reimbursement for digital medical technologies, or physician services under Medicare or Medicaid related to remote patient monitoring or telehealth, the rules and policies governing digital health have not been easy to distinguish. In the face of rapid innovation, it has been difficult to fit these products and services into existing regulations of the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, particularly when these frameworks never contemplated what communications technologies can do today. Instead, rules have been misapplied, and in some cases, they have hampered the use of these technologies, depressing the proliferation of associated services. However, regulations have begun to change. We discuss the policy and regulatory changes that have begun to evolve and where they should continue to head.},

Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined {CHD} (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with hospitalization), and combined {CVD} (combined {CHD}, stroke, treated angina without hospitalization, heart failure [{HF}], and peripheral arterial disease). {RESULTS}: Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, with no difference between treatments. Compared with chlorthalidone (6-year rate, 11.5\%), the relative risks ({RRs}) were 0.98 (95\% {CI}, 0.90-1.07) for amlodipine (6-year rate, 11.3\%) and 0.99 (95\% {CI}, 0.91-1.08) for lisinopril (6-year rate, 11.4\%). Likewise, all-cause mortality did not differ between groups. Five-year systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P =.03) and lisinopril (2 mm Hg, P{\textless}.001) groups compared with chlorthalidone, and 5-year diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower with amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P{\textless}.001). For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar except for a higher 6-year rate of {HF} with amlodipine (10.2\% vs 7.7\%; {RR}, 1.38; 95\% {CI}, 1.25-1.52). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, lisinopril had higher 6-year rates of combined {CVD} (33.3\% vs 30.9\%; {RR}, 1.10; 95\% {CI}, 1.05-1.16); stroke (6.3\% vs 5.6\%; {RR}, 1.15; 95\% {CI}, 1.02-1.30); and {HF} (8.7\% vs 7.7\%; {RR}, 1.19; 95\% {CI}, 1.07-1.31). {CONCLUSION}: Thiazide-type diuretics are superior in preventing 1 or more major forms of {CVD} and are less expensive. They should be preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy.},

	abstract = {Background: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Million Hearts initiative includes an ambitious ≥80\% blood pressure control goal in {US} adults with hypertension by 2022. We used the validated Blood Pressure Control Model to quantify changes in clinic-based hypertension management processes needed to attain ≥80\% blood pressure control. Methods and Results: The Blood Pressure Control Model simulates patient blood pressures weekly using 3 key modifiable hypertension management processes: office visit frequency, clinician treatment intensification given uncontrolled blood pressure, and continued antihypertensive medication use (medication adherence rate). We compared blood pressure control rates (using the Seventh Joint National Committee on hypertension targets) achieved over 4 years between usual care and the best-observed values for management processes identified from the literature (1-week return visit interval, 20\%-44\% intensification rate, and 76\% adherence rate). We determined the management process values needed to achieve ≥80\% blood pressure control in {US} adults. In adults with uncontrolled blood pressure, usual care achieved 45.6\% control (95\% uncertainty interval, 39.6\%-52.5\%) and literature-based best-observed values achieved 79.7\% control (95\% uncertainty interval, 79.3\%-80.1\%) over 4 years. Increasing treatment intensification rates to 62\% of office visits with an uncontrolled blood pressure resulted in ≥80\% blood pressure control, even when the return visit interval and adherence remained at usual care values. Improving to best-observed values for all 3 management processes would achieve 78.1\% blood pressure control in the overall {US} population with hypertension, approaching the ≥80\% Million Hearts 2022 goal. Conclusions: Achieving the Million Hearts blood pressure control goal by 2022 will require simultaneously increasing visit frequency, overcoming therapeutic inertia, and improving patient medication adherence. As the relative importance of each of these 3 processes will depend on local characteristics, simulation models like the Blood Pressure Control Model can help local healthcare systems tailor strategies to reach local and national benchmarks.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamacardio.2021.4996},
	abstract = {Importance: Black patients with hypertension often have the lowest rates of blood pressure ({BP}) control in clinical settings. It is unknown to what extent variation in health care processes explains this disparity. Objective: To assess whether and to what extent treatment intensification, scheduled follow-up interval, and missed visits are associated with racial and ethnic disparities in {BP} control. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, nested logistic regression models were used to estimate the likelihood of {BP} control (defined as a systolic {BP} [{SBP}] level {\textless}140 mm Hg) by race and ethnicity, and a structural equation model was used to assess the association of treatment intensification, scheduled follow-up interval, and missed visits with racial and ethnic disparities in {BP} control. The study included 16114 adults aged 20 years or older with hypertension and elevated {BP} (defined as an {SBP} level ≥140 mm Hg) during at least 1 clinic visit between January 1, 2015, and November 15, 2017. A total of 11 safety-net clinics within the San Francisco Health Network participated in the study. Data were analyzed from November 2019 to October 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Blood pressure control was assessed using the patient's most recent {BP} measurement as of November 15, 2017. Treatment intensification was calculated using the standard-based method, scored on a scale from-1.0 to 1.0, with-1.0 being the least amount of intensification and 1.0 being the most. Scheduled follow-up interval was defined as the mean number of days to the next scheduled visit after an elevated {BP} measurement. Missed visits measured the number of patients who did not show up for visits during the 4 weeks after an elevated {BP} measurement. Results: Among 16 114 adults with hypertension, the mean ({SD}) age was 58.6 (12.1) years, and 8098 patients (50.3\%) were female. A total of 4658 patients (28.9\%) were Asian, 3743 (23.2\%) were Black, 3694 (22.9\%) were Latinx, 2906 (18.0\%) were White, and 1113 (6.9\%) were of other races or ethnicities (including American Indian or Alaska Native [77 patients (0.4\%)], Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander [217 patients (1.3\%)], and unknown [819 patients (5.1\%)]). Compared with patients from all racial and ethnic groups, Black patients had lower treatment intensification scores (mean [{SD}],-0.33 [0.26] vs-0.29 [0.25]; β =-0.03, P {\textless}.001) and missed more visits (mean [{SD}], 0.8 [1.5] visits vs 0.4 [1.1] visits; β = 0.35; P {\textless}.001). In contrast, Asian patients had higher treatment intensification scores (mean [{SD}],-0.26 [0.23]; β = 0.02; P {\textless}.001) and fewer missed visits (mean [{SD}], 0.2 [0.7] visits; β =-0.20; P {\textless}.001). Black patients were less likely (odds ratio [{OR}], 0.82; 95\% {CI}, 0.75-0.89; P {\textless}.001) and Asian patients were more likely ({OR}, 1.13; 95\% {CI}, 1.02-1.25; P {\textless}.001) to achieve {BP} control than patients from all racial or ethnic groups. Treatment intensification and missed visits accounted for 21\% and 14\%, respectively, of the total difference in {BP} control among Black patients and 26\% and 13\% of the difference among Asian patients. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that racial and ethnic inequities in treatment intensification may be associated with more than 20\% of observed racial or ethnic disparities in {BP} control, and racial and ethnic differences in visit attendance may also play a role. Ensuring more equitable provision of treatment intensification could be a beneficial health care strategy to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in {BP} control.},

	abstract = {Background. Treatment of resistant hypertension has attained much attention during the past few years and naturally so has the prevalence of resistant hypertension. In the search for sources of such documentation, the lack of blood pressure ({BP}) control in randomized clinical outcome trials in hypertension has been used as indication of treatment-resistant hypertension. In the present study, we aimed at using previously unpublished information from monitoring of clinical trials in investigating the mechanism explaining why large fractions of patients in the trials remained uncontrolled for their high {BP}. Methods. We report insight information from {LIFE} (n = 9193), {VALUE} (n = 15,245), {ASCOT} (n = 19,257) and {ACCOMPLISH} (n = 11,506). Data stored during the course of the trials for monitoring purposes were scrutinized for fractions of patients with {BP} control, which was {BP} {\textless} 140/90 {mmHg} in all trials, and we identified monitoring data showing fractions of patients who had been uptitrated to the various dosing levels or combinations of study drugs in the trials. Fractions of patients who had not been uptitrated on drugs and who remained without {BP} control identified the level of physician (investigator) inertia in these trials. Results. In the {LIFE} Study the majority of patients remained with systolic {BP} {\textgreater} 140 {mmHg} throughout. Approximately 1500 patients remained on the first dose titration step despite not having reached target {BP}. In the {VALUE} Trial 59.5\% had reached systolic {BP} target 2 years into the study; 23.9\% of patients remained on the lowest study dose and only 15.1\% had been uptitrated to the highest study dose. In the {ASCOT} Trial, as many as 28\% of participants had not reached target diastolic {BP} at year 4 in the study, and of these patients 37\% still remained on the first drug dose titration step. In the {ACCOMPLISH} Trial approximately 80\% had achieved the systolic {BP} target at study end; however, during the course of the trial approximately 25\% of participants remained uncontrolled and at 6 months almost 60\% of these patients had not been titrated to the highest drug dose level. Conclusion. These data, taken from the monitoring phases of large outcome trials in hypertension, show that inertia, the lack of titration of study drugs to higher dosing levels or drug combinations according to the study protocols, is a major cause of not reaching {BP} targets in the trials. Thus, fractions of patients not reaching {BP} targets in outcome trials cannot be taken as evidence of treatment-resistant hypertension.},

To determine risk factors for syncope in a community-based sample, we performed a nested case-control study. We examined reports of syncope in Framingham Heart Study participants who underwent routine clinic visits from 1971 to 1990. For each syncope case (n = 543) 2 controls were matched for age, sex, and examination period. Mean age of subjects was 67 years (range 25 to 95); 59\% were women. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack, history of myocardial infarction, high blood pressure, use of antihypertensive medication, use of other cardiac medication, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, atrial fibrillation, {PR} interval prolongation, interventricular block, and diabetes or elevated glucose level were examined as potential predictors. Using conditional logistic regression analysis, the predictors of syncope included a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (odds ratio [{OR}] 2.56, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.62 to 4.04), use of cardiac medication ({OR} 1.67, 95\% {CI} 1.21 to 2.30), and high blood pressure ({OR} 1.46, 95\% {CI} 1.14 to 1.88).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Achieving hypertension control requires multiple supportive inventions, including self-measured blood pressure ({SMBP}). The objective of this study is to report the use of {SMBP} among {US} adults. {METHOD}(S): Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were used for this study. The 2019 survey included, for the first time, an optional {SMBP} module. Twenty states and the District of Columbia (N=159,536) opted to include the module, which assessed whether participants were advised by a healthcare professional to use {SMBP}, and if they used {SMBP} monitoring. Among those using {SMBP}, additional questions assessed the location of {SMBP} monitoring and whether {SMBP} readings were shared with a healthcare professional. {RESULT}(S): Among adults in the study population, 33.9\% (95\% confidence interval 33.4\%-34.5\%) reported having hypertension (N=66,869). Among them, nearly 70\% were recommended to use {SMBP} by their healthcare professional and approximately 61\% reported {SMBP} use regardless of recommendation. The most common location of {SMBP} was the home (85.6\%). Overall, {\textgreater}80\% shared their {SMBP} reading with their healthcare professional, 74\% and 7\% were shared in person and via the internet or email, respectively. There were differences in healthcare professional recommendations, use of {SMBP}, and {SMBP} information sharing across demographic characteristics and state of residency. {CONCLUSION}(S): {SMBP} recommendation was common practice among healthcare professionals, as reported by {US} adults with hypertension. Data from this study can be used to guide interventions to promote hypertension self-management and control.Copyright © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of American Journal of Hypertension Ltd 2021.

	abstract = {Home blood pressure monitor ({HBPM}) ownership prevalence and the factors that influence it are unclear. This study aimed to investigate factors associated with {HBPM} ownership among participants in the Treatment in Morning versus Evening ({TIME}) hypertension study. This study is a sub-analysis of the {TIME} study, a randomised trial investigating the effect of day-time versus night-time dosing of antihypertensive medication on cardiovascular outcomes in adults with hypertension. As part of the {TIME} study online registration process, participants were asked to indicate whether they owned an {HBPM}. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to determine factors associated with {HBPM} ownership. Of 21,104 randomised participants, 11,434 (54.2\%) reported owning an {HBPM}. The mean age of all participants at enrolment was 67.7 ± 9.3 years, 12,134 (57.5\%) were male, and 8892 (42.1\%) reported a current or previous history of smoking. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of reporting {HBPM} owned include being male ({OR}:1.47; 95\% {CI} 1.39–1.56) or residing in a less deprived socioeconomic region ({IMD} Decile 6–10) ({OR}:1.31; 95\% {CI} 1.23–1.40). Participants with a history of diabetes mellitus ({OR}:0.74; 95\% {CI}:0.64–0.86) or current smokers, compared to non-smokers, ({OR}:0.71; 95\% {CI}:0.62–0.82) were less likely to report owning an {HBPM}. This study has identified important patient factors influencing {HBPM} ownership. Further qualitative research would be valuable to identify and explore potential patient-level barriers to engagement with self-monitoring of blood pressure.},

The frequency of {HBPM} increased with age, body mass index, and the number of health care visits (all, P {\textless} 0.05). Also, race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic Blacks and non- Hispanic Asians), health insurance, diagnosed with diabetes, told by a health care provider to engage in {HBPM}, and diagnosed as hypertensive, were all associated with more frequent {HBPM} (P {\textless} 0.05). Adjusting for covariates, hypertensives who were aware of, treated for, and controlled engaged in more frequent {HBPM} compared to their respective references: unaware (odds ratio [{OR}] = 2.00, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 1.53-2.63), untreated ({OR} = 1.99, 95\% {CI} = 1.52-2.60), and uncontrolled ({OR} = 1.42, 95\% {CI} = 1.13-1.82).

	abstract = {Background: Widespread disruptions of medical care to mitigate {COVID}-19 spread and reduce burden on healthcare systems may have deleterious public health consequences. Design and methods: To examine factors contributing to healthcare interruptions during the pandemic, we conducted a {COVID}-19 impact survey between 10/7-12/14/2020 among participants of the Southern Community Cohort Study, which primarily enrolled low-income individuals in 12 southeastern states from 2002-2009. {COVID} survey data were combined with baseline and follow-up data. Results: Among 4463 respondents, 40\% reported having missed/delayed a health appointment during the pandemic; the common reason was provider-initiated cancellation or delay (63\%). In a multivariable model, female sex was the strongest independent predictor of interrupted care, with odds ratio ({OR}) 1.63 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.40-1.89). Those with higher education ({OR} 1.27; 95\% {CI} 1.05-1.54 for college graduate vs ≤high school) and household income ({OR} 1.47; 95\% {CI} 1.16-1.86 for {\textgreater}\$50,000 vs {\textless}\$15,000) were at significantly increased odds of missing healthcare. Having greater perceived risk for acquiring ({OR} 1.42; 95\% {CI} 1.17-1.72) or dying from {COVID}-19 ({OR} 1.25; 95\% {CI} 1.04-1.51) also significantly increased odds of missed/delayed healthcare. Age was inversely associated with missed healthcare among men ({OR} for 5-year increase in age 0.88; 95\% {CI} 0.80-0.96) but not women ({OR} 0.97; 95\% {CI} 0.91-1.04; P-interaction=0.04). Neither race/ethnicity nor comorbidities were associated with interrupted healthcare. Conclusions: Disruptions to healthcare disproportionately affected women and were primarily driven by health system-initiated deferrals and individual perceptions of {COVID}-19 risk, rather than medical co-morbidities or other traditional barriers to healthcare access.},

During the pandemic, 30.1 percent of all visits were provided via telemedicine, and the weekly number of visits increased twenty-three-fold compared with the prepandemic period. Telemedicine use was lower in communities with higher rates of poverty (31.9 percent versus 27.9 percent for the lowest and highest quartiles of poverty rate, respectively). Across specialties, the use of any telemedicine during the pandemic ranged from 68 percent of endocrinologists to 9 percent of ophthalmologists. Across common conditions, the percentage of visits provided during the pandemic via telemedicine ranged from 53 percent for depression to 3 percent for glaucoma. Higher rates of telemedicine use for common conditions were associated with smaller decreases in total weekly visits during the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Background: Our objective was to examine the variation in telemedicine adoption by specialty line and patient demographic characteristics after the initial peak period of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic when in-person visits had resumed and visit volume returned to prepandemic levels. Materials and Methods: Aggregated encounter data were extracted for six service lines (dermatology, psychiatry, endocrinology, cardiology, orthopedics, and nonurgent primary care) in an integrated health system across three time periods: July 1 to September 30, 2019 (n = 239,803), July 1 to September 30, 2020 (n = 245,648), and December 29, 2019 to October 3, 2020 (n = 624,886). Risk ratios were calculated to assess the relative use of telemedicine compared with in-person encounters and telemedicine modality (i.e., synchronous audio/video vs. audio-only telephone) by patient race, age, sex, and insurance type. Results: By June 2020, total visit volume returned to prepandemic levels. Differences in patient demographics between July 1 to September 30, 2020 and the previous year's baseline were negligible. Telemedicine adoption varied by medical specialty, from 3.2\% (dermatology) to 98.3\% (psychiatry) of visits. African American and male patients were less likely to use telemedicine (telephone or video) compared with white and female patients. Among telemedicine encounters, African American, publicly insured, and older patients were less likely to use video compared with white, commercially insured, and younger patients. Discussion: Variation in telemedicine adoption and modality underscores the importance of balancing patient- A nd clinic-level implementation factors to promote sustainable, equitable telemedicine integration. Conclusion: Understanding current trends in the "new normal"of telemedicine provides valuable insights into future implementation and financing.},

	abstract = {Background: Dramatic decreases in outpatient visits and sudden increases in telehealth visits were observed during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, but it was unclear whether these changes differed by patient demographics and socioeconomic status. Objective: This study aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on in-person outpatient and telehealth visits (telephone and video) by demographic characteristics and household income in a diverse population. Methods: We calculated weekly rates of outpatient and telehealth visits by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood-level median household income among members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California ({KPSC}) from January 5, 2020, to October 31, 2020, and the corresponding period in 2019. We estimated the percentage change in visit rates during the early pandemic period (March 22 to April 25, 2020) and the late pandemic period (October 4 to October 31, 2020) from the prepandemic period (January 5 to March 7, 2020) in Poisson regression models for each subgroup while adjusting for seasonality using 2019 data. We examined if the changes in visit rates differed by subgroups statistically by comparing their 95\% {CIs}. Results: Among 4.56 million {KPSC} members enrolled in January 2020, 15.0\% (n=682,947) were ≥65 years old, 51.5\% (n=2,345,020) were female, 39.4\% (n=1,795,994) were Hispanic, and 7.7\% (n=350,721) lived in an area of median household income {\textless}{US} \$40,000. Increases in telehealth visits during the pandemic varied across subgroups, while decreases in outpatient visits were similar, except by age. Among age groups, the ≥65 years population had the least increase in telehealth visits (236.6\%, 95\% {CI} 228.8\%-244.5\%), with 4.9 per one person-year during the early pandemic period versus 1.5 per one person-year during the prepandemic period. During the same periods, across racial/ethnic groups, Hispanic individuals had the largest increase in telehealth visits (295.5\%, 95\% {CI} 275.5\%-316.5\%). Across income levels, telehealth visits in the low-income group increased the most (313.5\%, 95\% {CI} 294.8\%-333.1\%). The rate of combined outpatient and telehealth visits in the Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and low-income groups returned to prepandemic levels by October 2020. Conclusions: The Hispanic group and low-income group had the largest percentage increase in telehealth utilization in response to the {COVID}-19 pandemic. The use of virtual care potentially mitigated the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization in these vulnerable populations.},

The model is informed by data from national surveys, cohort studies and trials, and was validated against two multicenter clinical trials ({ALLHAT} and {VALUE}). {SUBJECTS}: We studied a simulated, nationally representative cohort of patients with diagnosed but uncontrolled hypertension with a usual source of care. {INTERVENTIONS}: We simulated a base case and improvements of 10 and 50 \%, and an ideal scenario for three modifiable parameters: visit frequency, treatment intensification, and medication adherence. Ideal scenarios were defined as 100 \% for treatment intensification and adherence, and return visits occurring within 4 weeks of an elevated office systolic {BP}. {MAIN} {OUTCOME}: {BP} control at 52 weeks of follow-up was examined. {RESULTS}: Among 25,000 hypothetical adult patients with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic {BP} ≥ 140 {mmHg}), only 18 \% achieved {BP} control after 52 weeks using base-case assumptions. With 10/50 \%/idealized enhancements in each isolated parameter, enhanced treatment intensification achieved the greatest {BP} control (19/23/71 \%), compared with enhanced visit frequency (19/21/35 \%) and medication adherence (19/23/26 \%). When all three processes were idealized, the model predicted a {BP} control rate of 95 \% at 52 weeks. {CONCLUSION}: Substantial improvements in {BP} control can only be achieved through major improvements in processes of care. Healthcare systems may achieve greater success by increasing the frequency of clinical encounters and improving physicians’ prescribing behavior than by attempting to improve patient adherence to medications.},

This article describes the M.A.P. checklists: a framework to help practice teams summarize best practices for providing coordinated, evidence-based care to patients with hypertension. Consisting of three domains—Measure Accurately; Act Rapidly; and Partner With Patients, Families, and Communities—the checklists were developed by a team of clinicians, hypertension experts, and quality improvement experts through a multistep process that combined literature review, iterative feedback from a panel of internationally recognized experts, and pilot testing among a convenience sample of primary care practices in two states. In contrast to many guidelines, the M.A.P. checklists specifically target practice teams, instead of individual clinicians, and are designed to be brief, cognitively easy to consume and recall, and accessible to healthcare workers from a range of professional backgrounds.},

	abstract = {Background The {COVID}-19 pandemic led to dramatic increases in telemedicine use to provide outpatient care without in-person contact risks. Telemedicine increases options for health care access, but a digital divide of disparate access may prevent certain populations from realizing the benefits of telemedicine. Objectives The study aimed to understand telemedicine utilization patterns after a widespread deployment to identify potential disparities exacerbated by expanded telemedicine usage. Methods We performed a cross-sectional retrospective analysis of adults who scheduled outpatient visits between June 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 at a single-integrated academic health system encompassing a broad range of subspecialties and a large geographic region in the Upper Midwest, during a period of time after the initial surge of {COVID}-19 when most standard clinical services had resumed. At the beginning of this study period, approximately 72\% of provider visits were telemedicine visits. The primary study outcome was whether a patient had one or more video-based visits, compared with audio-only (telephone) visits or in-person visits only. The secondary outcome was whether a patient had any telemedicine visits (video-based or audio-only), compared with in-person visits only. Results A total of 197,076 individuals were eligible (average age = 46 years, 56\% females). Increasing age, rural status, Asian or Black/African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, and self-pay/uninsured status were significantly negatively associated with having a video visit. Digital literacy, measured by patient portal activation status, was significantly positively associated with having a video visit, as were Medicaid or Medicare as payer and American Indian/Alaskan Native race. Conclusion Our findings reinforce previous evidence that older age, rural status, lower socioeconomic status, Asian race, Black/African American race, and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity are associated with lower rates of video-based telemedicine use. Health systems and policies should seek to mitigate such barriers to telemedicine when possible, with efforts such as digital literacy outreach and equitable distribution of telemedicine infrastructure.},

Design: Randomized clinical trial. Setting: Academic and private practices across the United States (N = 102). Participants: Adults aged 50 and older with a systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) of 130 to 180 {mmHg} at high risk of cardiovascular disease events, but without diabetes, history of stroke, symptomatic heart failure or ejection fraction less than 35\%, dementia, or standing {SBP} less than 110 {mmHg} (N = 9,361). Intervention: Treatment of {SBP} to a goal of less than 120 {mmHg} or 140 {mmHg}. Measurements: Outcomes were {SAEs} involving syncope, hypotension, and falls. Predictors were treatment assignment, demographic characteristics, comorbidities, baseline measurements, and baseline use of cardiovascular medications. Results: One hundred seventy-two (1.8\%) participants had {SAEs} involving syncope, 155 (1.6\%) hypotension, and 203 (2.2\%) falls. Randomization to intensive {SBP} control was associated with greater risk of an {SAE} involving hypotension (hazard ratio ({HR}) = 1.67, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) = 1.21–2.32, P =.002), and possibly syncope ({HR} = 1.32, 95\% {CI} = 0.98–1.79, P =.07), but not falls ({HR} = 0.98, 95\% {CI} = 0.75–1.29, P =.90). Risk of all three outcomes was higher for participants with chronic kidney disease or frailty. Older age was also associated with greater risk of syncope, hypotension, and falls, but there was no age-by-treatment interaction for any of the {SAE} outcomes. Conclusions: Participants randomized to intensive {SBP} control had greater risk of hypotension and possibly syncope, but not falls. The greater risk of developing these events associated with intensive treatment did not vary according to age.},

	abstract = {Objective: Our objective was to assess the relationship between antihypertensive drugs, loop diuretics, and the risk of hospitalization for hip fracture ({HF}). Design: We conducted a population-based study in a cohort of 81,617 patients from Lombardy (Italy) aged 70–90 years who were newly treated with antihypertensive agents or loop diuretics between 2005 and 2009. Cases were the 2153 patients who experienced the outcome (hospitalization for {HF} before 31 December 2012). For each case, up to three controls were randomly selected from the cohort to be matched for sex, age at cohort entry, and date of initial prescription. The case–control and case-crossover designs and the logistic regression for matched sets were used to measure the strength of the association between current use of an antihypertensive drug (within 30 days before the {HF} hospitalization) and the risk of outcome. Results: Case–control and case-crossover odds ratios ({ORs}) for current use of loop diuretics were 1.67 (95 \% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.28–2.18) and 1.49 (95 \% {CI} 1.05–2.10), respectively. Among patients aged 81–90 years, case–control and case-crossover {ORs} were 1.52 (95 \% {CI} 1.04–2.21) and 1.82 (95 \% {CI} 1.10–3.00) for current use of loop diuretics and 1.86 (95 \% {CI} 1.03–3.35) and 1.88 (95 \% {CI} 1.01–3.48) for α-blockers. No other agent was associated with the outcome. Conclusions: Evidence that loop diuretics and α-blockers are associated with a higher risk of {HF} was consistent in the two observational approaches. Clinicians should carefully consider the risk of falls in their selection of drugs for hypertension and in the clinical use of loop diuretics.},

Among adults aged 35 to 64 years, county-level hypertension-related {CVD} death rates increased from a median of 23.2 per 100 000 in 2000 to 43.4 per 100 000 in 2019.

Increases were larger and more prevalent among adults aged 35 to 64 years than those aged ≥65 years. More than 75\% of counties experienced increasing hypertension-related {CVD} death rates among patients aged 35 to 64 years during 2000 to 2010 and 2010 to 2019 (76.2\% [95\% credible interval, 74.7–78.4] and 86.2\% [95\% credible interval, 84.6–87.6], respectively), compared with 48.2\% (95\% credible interval, 47.0–49.7) during 2000 to 2010 and 66.1\% (95\% credible interval, 64.9–67.1) for patients aged ≥65 years.

In this article, we explore the utility and interpretation of the standardized difference for comparing the prevalence of dichotomous variables between two groups. We examined the relationship between the standardized difference, and the maximal difference in the prevalence of the binary variable between two groups, the relative risk relating the prevalence of the binary variable in one group compared to the prevalence in the other group, and the phi coefficient for measuring correlation between the treatment group and the binary variable. We found that a standardized difference of 10\% (or 0.1) is equivalent to having a phi coefficient of 0.05 (indicating negligible correlation) for the correlation between treatment group and the binary variable.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of real-world antihypertensive use is largely restricted to those with prevalent hypertension, limiting our understanding of how antihypertensive treatment evolves and its contribution to persistently poor {BP} control. We sought to characterize antihypertensive initiation patterns among new users. Using Medicaid and Medicare data from the {OneFlorida} Clinical Research Consortium, we identified new users of ≥1 first-line antihypertensive (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor [{ACEI}], calcium channel blocker [{CCB}], angiotensin receptor blocker [{ARB}], thiazide diuretic, or β-blocker) between 2013 and 2021 among adults with a hypertension diagnosis, and no prior antihypertensive fill during a continuous insurance enrollment period of 12 months prior to first antihypertensive fill. Where possible, we linked clinical {EHR} data from the prescribing visit preceding the fill. We evaluated initial antihypertensive regimens (including all antihypertensives filled on index date) by class and drug overall and across study years, and examined variation in antihypertensive initiation across demographic (sex, race, ethnicity), comorbidity (chronic kidney disease [{CKD}], diabetes, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [{ASCVD}]), and {BP} category. We identified 152,904 patients initiating 204,170 antihypertensives (74\% monotherapy; 26\% combination therapy), with mean age of 58 years and 57\% of whom were women. The most commonly initiated antihypertensive class was {ACEIs} (39\%) followed by β-blockers (32\%), {CCBs} (24\%), thiazides (19\%), and {ARBs} (11\%). Excepting β-blockers, a single drug accounted for ≥75\% of use of each class. β-blocker use decreased substantially (36\% to 26\%) and {CCB} use increased (20\% to 26\%) over the study period, while initiation of most other classes remained relatively stable. We also observed significant differences in proportion of patients initiating several first-line classes across demographic, comorbidity, and especially, baseline {BP} strata. Substantial variation exists in initial antihypertensive prescribing and there remain significant gaps between current guideline recommendations and real world implementation in early hypertension care.},

Here, we review studies in which dietary intake by self report was determined while energy expenditure was simultaneously measured using the doubly labeled water ({DLW}) method. In seeking to establish the relative accuracy of each instrument to capture true habitual energy intake, we conclude that none of the self-reported intake instruments demonstrates greater accuracy against {DLW}. Instead, it is evident that the physical and psychological characteristics of study participants play a significant role in the underreporting bias observed in these studies.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Over the course of human evolution, shifts in dietary practices such as meat-eating and cooking, have resulted in reduced fiber intake, a trend that has been exaggerated more recently in industrialized populations. Reduced fiber consumption is associated with a loss of gut microbial taxa that degrade fiber, particularly butyrate. Therefore, this dietary shift in humans may have altered the abundance of microbial genes involved in butyrate production. This study uses a gene-targeted alignment approach to quantify the abundance of butyrate production pathway genes from published wild nonhuman primate and human gut metagenomes. Surprisingly, humans have higher diversity and relative abundances of butyrate production pathways compared with all groups of nonhuman primates except cercopithecoids. Industrialized populations of humans also differ only slightly in butyrate pathway abundance from nonindustrialized populations. This apparent resilience of butyrate production pathways to shifts in human diet across both evolutionary and modern populations may signal an evolutionary shift in host–microbe interactions in humans that increased {SCFA} production. Such a shift could have contributed to meeting the increased energy requirements of humans relative to nonhuman primates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Butyrate-producing bacteria have recently gained attention, since they are important for a healthy colon and when altered contribute to emerging diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and type {II} diabetes. This guild is polyphyletic and cannot be accurately detected by 16S {rRNA} gene sequencing. Consequently, approaches targeting the terminal genes of the main butyrate-producing pathway have been developed. However, since additional pathways exist and alternative, newly recognized enzymes catalyzing the terminal reaction have been described, previous investigations are often incomplete. We undertook a broad analysis of butyrate-producing pathways and individual genes by screening 3, 184 sequenced bacterial genomes from the Integrated Microbial Genome database. Genomes of 225 bacteria with a potential to produce butyrate were identified, including many previously unknown candidates. The majority of candidates belong to distinct families within the Firmicutes, but members of nine other phyla, especially from Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Thermotogae, were also identified as potential butyrate producers. The established gene catalogue (3, 055 entries) was used to screen for butyrate synthesis pathways in 15 metagenomes derived from stool samples of healthy individuals provided by the {HMP} (Human Microbiome Project) consortium. A high percentage of total genomes exhibited a butyrate-producing pathway (mean, 19.1\%; range, 3.2\% to 39.4\%), where the acetyl-coenzyme A ({CoA}) pathway was the most prevalent (mean, 79.7\% of all pathways), followed by the lysine pathway (mean, 11.2\%). Diversity analysis for the acetyl-{CoA} pathway showed that the same few firmicute groups associated with several Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae were dominating in most individuals, whereas the other pathways were associated primarily with Bacteroidetes. © 2014 Vital et al.},

Contaminants come from various sources, including reagents. Appropriate laboratory practices can reduce contamination, but do not eliminate it. Here we introduce decontam (https://github.com/benjjneb/decontam), an open-source R package that implements a statistical classification procedure that identifies contaminants in {MGS} data based on two widely reproduced patterns: contaminants appear at higher frequencies in low-concentration samples and are often found in negative controls. Results: Decontam classified amplicon sequence variants ({ASVs}) in a human oral dataset consistently with prior microscopic observations of the microbial taxa inhabiting that environment and previous reports of contaminant taxa. In metagenomics and marker-gene measurements of a dilution series, decontam substantially reduced technical variation arising from different sequencing protocols. The application of decontam to two recently published datasets corroborated and extended their conclusions that little evidence existed for an indigenous placenta microbiome and that some low-frequency taxa seemingly associated with preterm birth were contaminants. Conclusions: Decontam improves the quality of metagenomic and marker-gene sequencing by identifying and removing contaminant {DNA} sequences. Decontam integrates easily with existing {MGS} workflows and allows researchers to generate more accurate profiles of microbial communities at little to no additional cost.},

	abstract = {Background: Identifying which taxa are targeted by immunoglobulins can uncover important host-microbe interactions. Immunoglobulin binding of commensal taxa can be assayed by sorting bound bacteria from samples and using amplicon sequencing to determine their taxonomy, a technique most widely applied to study Immunoglobulin A ({IgA}-Seq). Previous experiments have scored taxon binding in {IgA}-Seq datasets by comparing abundances in the {IgA} bound and unbound sorted fractions. However, as these are relative abundances, such scores are influenced by the levels of the other taxa present and represent an abstract combination of these effects. Diversity in the practical approaches of prior studies also warrants benchmarking of the individual stages involved. Here, we provide a detailed description of the design strategy for an optimised {IgA}-Seq protocol. Combined with a novel scoring method for {IgA}-Seq datasets that accounts for the aforementioned effects, this platform enables accurate identification and quantification of commensal gut microbiota targeted by host immunoglobulins. Results: Using germ-free and Rag1−/− mice as negative controls, and a strain-specific {IgA} antibody as a positive control, we determine optimal reagents and fluorescence-activated cell sorting ({FACS}) parameters for {IgA}-Seq. Using simulated {IgA}-Seq data, we show that existing {IgA}-Seq scoring methods are influenced by pre-sort relative abundances. This has consequences for the interpretation of case-control studies where there are inherent differences in microbiota composition between groups. We show that these effects can be addressed using a novel scoring approach based on posterior probabilities. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of both the {IgA}-Seq protocol and probability-based scores by examining both novel and published data from in vivo disease models. Conclusions: We provide a detailed {IgA}-Seq protocol to accurately isolate {IgA}-bound taxa from intestinal samples. Using simulated and experimental data, we demonstrate novel probability-based scores that adjust for the compositional nature of relative abundance data to accurately quantify taxon-level {IgA} binding. All scoring approaches are made available in the {IgAScores} R package. These methods should improve the generation and interpretation of {IgA}-Seq datasets and could be applied to study other immunoglobulins and sample types.

	abstract = {Microbial communities carry out the majority of the biochemical activity on the planet, and they play integral roles in processes including metabolism and immune homeostasis in the human microbiome. Shotgun sequencing of such communities' metagenomes provides information complementary to organismal abundances from taxonomic markers, but the resulting data typically comprise short reads from hundreds of different organisms and are at best challenging to assemble comparably to single-organism genomes. Here, we describe an alternative approach to infer the functional and metabolic potential of a microbial community metagenome. We determined the gene families and pathways present or absent within a community, as well as their relative abundances, directly from short sequence reads. We validated this methodology using a collection of synthetic metagenomes, recovering the presence and abundance both of large pathways and of small functional modules with high accuracy. We subsequently applied this method, {HUMAnN}, to the microbial communities of 649 metagenomes drawn from seven primary body sites on 102 individuals as part of the Human Microbiome Project ({HMP}). This provided a means to compare functional diversity and organismal ecology in the human microbiome, and we determined a core of 24 ubiquitously present modules. Core pathways were often implemented by different enzyme families within different body sites, and 168 functional modules and 196 metabolic pathways varied in metagenomic abundance specifically to one or more niches within the microbiome. These included glycosaminoglycan degradation in the gut, as well as phosphate and amino acid transport linked to host phenotype (vaginal {pH}) in the posterior fornix. An implementation of our methodology is available at http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann. This provides a means to accurately and efficiently characterize microbial metabolic pathways and functional modules directly from high-throughput sequencing reads, enabling the determination of community roles in the {HMP} cohort and in future metagenomic studies. © 2012 Abubucker et al.},

A mediation model can be used to describe the interaction between host gene expression, the gut microbiome, and clinical/health situation (e.g., diseased or not, inflammation level) and may provide insights into underlying disease mechanisms. Current mediation regression methodology cannot adequately model high-dimensional exposures and mediators or mixed data types. Additionally, regression based mediation models require some assumptions for the model parameters, and the relationships are usually assumed to be linear and additive. With the microbiome being the mediators, these assumptions are violated. We propose two novel nonparametric procedures utilizing information theory to detect significant mediation effects with high-dimensional exposures and mediators and varying data types while avoiding standard regression assumptions. Compared with available methods through comprehensive simulation studies, the proposed method shows higher power and lower error.

It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for {ANOVA} (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by {McArdle} and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, including control and stress, attitudes, and personality traits. We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators. © 1986 American Psychological Association.},

	abstract = {Studies focusing on taxonomic compositions of the gut microbiota are plentiful, whereas its functional capabilities are still poorly understood. Specific key functions deserve detailed investigations, as they regulate microbiota-host interactions and promote host health and disease. The production of butyrate is among the top targets since depletion of this microbe-derived metabolite is linked to several emerging noncommunicable diseases and was shown to facilitate establishment of enteric pathogens by disrupting colonization resistance. In this study, we established a workflow to investigate in detail the composition of the polyphyletic butyrate-producing community from omics data extracting its biochemical and taxonomic diversity. By combining information from various publicly available data sets, we identified universal ecological key features of this functional group and shed light on its role in health and disease. Our results will assist the development of precision medicine to combat functional dysbiosis. Given the key role of butyrate for host health, understanding the ecology of intestinal butyrate-producing communities is a top priority for gut microbiota research. To this end, we performed a pooled analysis on 2,387 metagenomic/transcriptomic samples from 15 publicly available data sets that originated from three continents and encompassed eight diseases as well as specific interventions. For analyses, a gene catalogue was constructed from gene-targeted assemblies of all genes from butyrate synthesis pathways of all samples and from an updated reference database derived from genome screenings. We demonstrate that butyrate producers establish themselves within the first year of life and display high abundances ({\textgreater}20\% of total bacterial community) in adults regardless of origin. Various bacteria form this functional group, exhibiting a biochemical diversity including different pathways and terminal enzymes, where one carbohydrate-fueled pathway was dominant with butyryl coenzyme A ({CoA}):acetate {CoA} transferase as the main terminal enzyme. Subjects displayed a high richness of butyrate producers, and 17 taxa, primarily members of the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae along with some Bacteroidetes , were detected in {\textgreater}70\% of individuals, encompassing {\textasciitilde}85\% of the total butyrate-producing potential. Most of these key taxa were also found to express genes for butyrate formation, indicating that butyrate producers occupy various niches in the gut ecosystem, concurrently synthesizing that compound. Furthermore, results from longitudinal analyses propose that diversity supports functional stability during ordinary life disturbances and during interventions such as antibiotic treatment. A reduction of the butyrate-producing potential along with community alterations was detected in various diseases, where patients suffering from cardiometabolic disorders were particularly affected.  {IMPORTANCE} Studies focusing on taxonomic compositions of the gut microbiota are plentiful, whereas its functional capabilities are still poorly understood.

Suboptimal adherence, which includes failure to initiate pharmacotherapy, to take medications as often as prescribed, and to persist on therapy long-term, is a well-recognized factor contributing to the poor control of blood pressure in hypertension. Several categories of factors including demographic, socioeconomic, concomitant medical-behavioral conditions, therapy-related, healthcare team and system-related factors, and patient factors are associated with nonadherence. Understanding the categories of factors contributing to nonadherence is useful in managing nonadherence. In patients at high risk for major adverse cardiovascular outcomes, electronic and biochemical monitoring are useful for detecting nonadherence and for improving adherence. Increasing the availability and affordability of these more precise measures of adherence represent a future opportunity to realize more of the proven benefits of evidence-based medications. In the absence of new antihypertensive drugs, it is important that healthcare providers focus their attention on how to do better with the drugs they have. This is the reason why recent guidelines have emphasize the important need to address drug adherence as a major issue in hypertension management.},

	doi = {10.1101/2022.03.14.22272365},
	abstract = {Freezing of gait ({FOG}) is a major cause of falling and leads to loss of independence in Parkinson’s disease ({PD}). The pathophysiology of {FOG} is poorly understood – although there is a hypothesized link with {NE} systems. {PD}-{FOG} can present in levodopa-responsive and unresponsive forms.

We examined {NE} transporter ({NET}) binding via brain positron emission tomography ({PET}) to evaluate changes in {NET} density associated with {FOG} using the high affinity selective {NET} antagonist radioligand [11C]{MeNER} (2S,3S)(2-[α-(2-methoxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine) in N=52 parkinsonian patients. We used a rigorous levodopa challenge paradigm to characterize patients as non-freezing {PD} ({NO}-{FOG}, N=16), levodopa responsive freezing ({OFF}-{FOG}, N=10), levodopa-unresponsive freezing ({ONOFF}-{FOG}, N=21), and primary progressive freezing of gait ({PP}-{FOG}, N=5).

Linear mixed models identified significant reductions in whole brain {NET} binding in the {OFF}-{FOG} group compared to the {NO}-{FOG} group (−16.8\%, P=0.021). Additional contrasts tested post-hoc identified trends toward increased {NET} expression in {ONOFF}-{FOG} vs. {OFF}-{FOG} (≈10\%; P=0.123). Linear mixed models with interaction terms identified significantly reduced {NET} binding in right thalamus in the {OFF}-{FOG} group (P=0.038). A linear regression analysis identified an association between reduced {NET} binding and more severe {NFOG}-Q score only in the {OFF}-{FOG} group (P=0.022).

This is the first study to examine brain noradrenergic innervation using {NET}-{PET} in {PD} patients with and without {FOG}. Based on the normal regional distribution of noradrenergic innervation and pathological studies in the thalamus of {PD} patients, the implications of our findings suggest that noradrenergic limbic pathways may play a key role in {OFF}-{FOG} in {PD}. This finding could have implications for clinical subtyping of {FOG} as well as development of therapies.

	abstract = {The {ECAT} high resolution research tomograph ({HRRT}) is a dedicated brain and small animal {PET} scanner, with design features that enable high image spatial resolution combined with high sensitivity. The {HRRT} is the first commercially available scanner that utilizes a double layer of {LSO}/{LYSO} crystals to achieve photon detection with depth-of-interaction information. In this study, the performance of the commercial {LSO}/{LYSO} {HRRT} was characterized, using the {NEMA} protocol as a guideline. Besides measurement of spatial resolution, energy resolution, sensitivity, scatter fraction, count rate performance, correction for attenuation and scatter, hot spot recovery and image quality, a clinical evaluation was performed by means of a {HR}+/{HRRT} human brain comparison study. Point source resolution varied across the field of view from approximately 2.3 to 3.2 mm ({FWHM}) in the transaxial direction and from 2.5 to 3.4 mm in the axial direction. Absolute line-source sensitivity ranged from 2.5 to 3.3\% and the {NEMA}-2001 scatter fraction equalled 45\%. Maximum {NECR} was 45 kcps and 148 kcps according to the {NEMA}-2001 and 1994 protocols, respectively. Attenuation and scatter correction led to a volume uniformity of 6.3\% and a system uniformity of 3.1\%. Reconstructed values deviated up to 15 and 8\% in regions with high and low densities, respectively, which can possibly be assigned to inaccuracies in scatter estimation. Hot spot recovery ranged from 60 to 94\% for spheres with diameters of 1 to 2.2 cm. A high quantitative agreement was met between {HR}+ and {HRRT} clinical data. In conclusion, the {ECAT} {HRRT} has excellent resolution and sensitivity properties, which is a crucial advantage in many research studies. © 2007 {IOP} Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The analysis of the human cerebral cortex and the measurement of its thickness based on {MRI} data can provide insight into normal brain development and neurodegenerative disorders. Accurate and reproducible results of the cortical thickness measurement are desired for sensitive detection. This study compares ultra-high resolution data acquired at 7. T with 3. T data for determination of the cortical thickness of the human brain. The impact of field strength, resolution, and processing method is evaluated systematically. Methods: Five subjects were scanned at 3. T (1. mm isotropic resolution) and 7. T (1. mm and 0.5. mm isotropic resolution) with 3D {MP}-{RAGE} and 3D gradient echo methods. The inhomogeneous signal and contrast of the 7. T data due to the B1 field was corrected by division of the {MP}-{RAGE} with the {GE}. {ARCTIC}, utilizing a voxel-based approach, and {FreeSurfer}, utilizing a surface-based approach, have been used to compute the cortical thickness of the high resolution 3. T and 7. T data and of the ultra-high resolution 7. T data. {FreeSurfer} is not designed to process data with a spatial resolution other than 1. mm and was modified to avoid this limitation. Additionally {SPM} and {FSL} have been used to generate segmentations which were further processed with {ARCTIC} to determine the cortical thickness. Results and Conclusion: At identical resolution, the cortical thickness determination yielded consistent results between 3. T and 7. T confirming the robustness of the acquisition and processing against potential field strength related effects. However, the ultra-high resolution 7. T data resulted in significantly reduced values for the cortical thickness estimation compared to the lower resolution data. The reduction in thickness amounts approximately one sixth to one third, depending on the processing algorithm and software used. This suggests a bias in the gray matter segmentation due to partial volume effects and indicates that true cortical thickness is overestimated by most current {MR} studies using both a voxel-based or surface-based method and can be more accurately determined with high resolution imaging at 7.

The techniques described include only a few of the literally thousands of {MR} imaging pulse sequences that have been developed over the past 20 years. As this brief survey indicates, pulse sequences have been developed that furnish a great range of image contrast behaviors, acquisition speeds, and sensitivities to artifacts.

However, quantitative interpretations of signal are confounded by large interindividual variability in binding affinity, which displays a trimodal distribution compatible with a codominant genetic trait. Here, we tested directly for an underlying genetic mechanism to explain this. Binding affinity of {PBR}28 was measured in platelets isolated from 41 human subjects and tested for association with polymorphisms in {TSPO} and genes encoding other proteins in the {TSPO} complex. Complete agreement was observed between the {TSPO} Ala147Thr genotype and {PBR}28 binding affinity phenotype (P value3.1 × 10 13). The {TSPO} Ala147Thr polymorphism predicts {PBR}28 binding affinity in human platelets. As all second-generation {TSPO} {PET} radioligands tested hitherto display a trimodal distribution in binding affinity analogous to {PBR}28, testing for this polymorphism may allow quantitative interpretation of {TSPO} {PET} studies with these radioligands. © 2012 {ISCBFM} All rights reserved.},

We tested if in vitro binding to leukocytes distinguished {TSPO} genotypes and if genotype could affect clinical studies using the {TSPO} radioligand [11 C]{PBR}28. In vitro binding to leukocytes and [ 11 C]{PBR}28 brain imaging were performed in 27 human subjects with known {TSPO} genotype. Specific [3 H]{PBR}28 binding was measured in prefrontal cortex of 45 schizophrenia patients and 47 controls. Leukocyte binding to {PBR}28 predicted genotype in all subjects. Brain uptake was ∼40\% higher in {HH} than {HL} subjects. Specific [3 H]{PBR}28 binding in {LL} controls was negligible, while {HH} controls had ∼80\% higher binding than {HL} controls. After excluding {LL} subjects, specific binding was 16\% greater in schizophrenia patients than controls. This difference was insignificant by itself (P=0.085), but was significant after correcting for {TSPO} genotype (P=0.011).

The aim of this study was to develop a database and a food frequency questionnaire ({FFQ}) allowing detailed {DF} intake estimation including prebiotic (oligo)saccharides. A repertoire of {DF} detailing total, soluble {DF}, insoluble {DF} and prebiotic (oligo)saccharides (inulin-type fructans, fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides) in food products consumed in Europe has been established. A 12 month {FFQ} was developed and submitted to 15 healthy volunteers from the {FiberTAG} study. Our data report a total {DF} intake of 38 g/day in the tested population. Fructan and fructo-oligosaccharides intake, linked notably to condiments (garlic and onions) ingestion, reached 5 and 2 g/day, respectively, galacto-oligosaccharides intake level being lower (1 g/day). We conclude that the {FiberTAG} repertoire and {FFQ} are major tools for the evaluation of the total amount of {DF} including prebiotics. Their use can be helpful in intervention or observational studies devoted to analyze microbiota–nutrient interactions in different pathological contexts, as well as to revisit {DF} intake recommendations as part of healthy lifestyles considering specific {DF}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Low dietary fibre intake has been associated with poorer health outcomes, therefore having the ability to be able to quickly assess an individual’s dietary fibre intake would prove useful in clinical practice and for research purposes. Current dietary assessment methods such as food records and food frequency questionnaires are time-consuming and burdensome, and there are presently no published short dietary fibre intake questionnaires that can quantify an individual’s total habitual dietary fibre intake and classify individuals as low, moderate or high habitual dietary fibre consumers. Therefore, we aimed to develop and validate a habitual dietary fibre intake short food frequency questionnaire ({DFI}-{FFQ}) which can quickly and accurately classify individuals based on their habitual dietary fibre intake. In this study the {DFI}-{FFQ} was validated against the Monash University comprehensive nutrition assessment questionnaire ({CNAQ}). Fifty-two healthy, normal weight male (n = 17) and female (n = 35) participants, aged between 21 and 61 years, completed the {DFI}-{FFQ} twice and the {CNAQ} once. All eligible participants completed the study, however the data from 46\% of the participants were excluded from analysis secondary to misreporting. The {DFI}-{FFQ} cannot accurately quantify total habitual dietary fibre intakes, however, it is a quick, valid and reproducible tool in classifying individuals based on their habitual dietary fibre intakes.},

	abstract = {Hypertension is a worldwide problem with major impacts on health including morbidity and mortality, as well as consumption of health care resources. Nearly 50\% of American adults have high blood pressure, and this rate is rising. Even with multiple antihypertensive drugs and aggressive lifestyle modifications, blood pressure is inadequately controlled in about 1 of 5 hypertensive individuals. This review highlights a hypothesis for hypertension that suggests alternative mechanisms for blood pressure elevation and maintenance. A better understanding of these mechanisms could open avenues for more successful treatments. The hypothesis accounts for recent understandings of the involvement of gut physiology, gut microbiota, and neuroinflammation in hypertension. It includes bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and gut epithelium in the gut-brain axis that is involved in regulation of autonomic nervous system activity and blood pressure control. Dysfunction of this gut-brain axis, including dysbiosis of gut microbiota, gut epithelial dysfunction, and deranged input to the brain, contributes to hypertension via inflammatory mediators, metabolites, bacteria in the circulation, afferent information alterations, etc resulting in neuroinflammation and unbalanced autonomic nervous system activity that elevates blood pressure. This in turn negatively affects gut function and its microbiota exacerbating the problem. We focus this review on the gut-brain axis hypothesis for hypertension and possible contribution to racial disparities in hypertension. A novel idea, that immunoglobulin A-coated bacteria originating in the gut with access to the brain could be involved in hypertension, is raised. Finally, minocycline, with its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, is evaluated as a potential antihypertensive drug acting on this axis.},

	abstract = {Noninfectious (autoimmune and immune-mediated) uveitis is an ocular inflammatory disease which can lead to blindness in severe cases. Due to the potential side effects of first-line drugs for clinical uveitis, novel drugs and targets against uveitis are still urgently needed. In the present study, using rat experimental autoimmune uveitis ({EAU}) model, we first found that minocycline treatment can substantially inhibit the development of {EAU} and improve the retinal function by suppressing the retinal microglial activation, and block the infiltration of inflammatory cells, including Th17, into the retina by decreasing the major histocompatibility complex class {II} ({MHC} {II}) expression in resident and infiltrating cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that minocycline treatment can remodel the gut microenvironment of {EAU} rats by restoring the relative abundance of Ruminococcus bromii, Streptococcus hyointestinalis, and Desulfovibrio sp. {ABHU}2SB and promoting a functional shift in the gut via reversing the levels of L-proline, allicin, aceturic acid, xanthine, and leukotriene B4, and especially increasing the production of propionic acid, histamine, and pantothenic acid. At last, we revealed that minocycline treatment can significantly attenuate the progression of {EAU} after inflammation onset, which may be explained by the role of minocycline in the remodeling of the gut microenvironment since selective elimination of retinal microglia on the later stages of {EAU} was shown to have little effect. These data clearly demonstrated that inhibition of microglial activation and remodeling of the gut microenvironment can suppress the development and progression of experimental autoimmune uveitis. Considering the excellent safety profile of minocycline in multiple clinical experiments, we suggest that minocycline may have therapeutic implications for clinical uveitis.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Increased microglial activation and neuroinflammation within autonomic brain regions have been implicated in sustained hypertension, and their inhibition by minocycline-an anti-inflammatory antibiotic-produces beneficial effects. These observations led us to propose a dysfunctional brain-gut communication hypothesis for hypertension. However, it has been difficult to reconcile whether an anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial action is the primary beneficial effect of minocycline in hypertension. Accordingly, we utilized chemically modified tetracycline-3 ({CMT}-3)- A derivative of tetracycline that has potent anti-inflammatory activity-to address this question. Objective: Test the hypothesis that central administration of {CMT}-3 would inhibit microglial activation, attenuate neuroinflammation, alter selective gut microbial communities, protect the gut wall from developing hypertension-associated pathology, and attenuate hypertension. Methods and Results: Rats were implanted with radiotelemetry devices for recording mean arterial pressure. Ang {II} (angiotensin {II}) was infused subcutaneously using osmotic mini-pumps to induce hypertension. Another osmotic mini-pump was surgically implanted to infuse {CMT}-3 intracerebroventricularly. Intracerebroventricular {CMT}-3 infusion was also investigated in {SHR} (spontaneously hypertensive rats). Physiological, pathological, immunohistological parameters, and fecal microbiota were analyzed. Intracerebroventricular {CMT}-3 significantly inhibited Ang {II}-induced increases in number of microglia, their activation, and proinflammatory cytokines in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus. Further, intracerebroventricular {CMT}-3 attenuated increased mean arterial pressure, normalized sympathetic activity, and left ventricular hypertrophy in Ang {II} rats, as well as in the {SHR}. Finally, {CMT}-3 beneficially restored certain gut microbial communities altered by Ang {II} and attenuated pathological alterations in gut wall. Conclusions: These observations demonstrate that inhibition of microglial activation alone was sufficient to induce significant antihypertensive effects. This was associated with unique changes in gut microbial communities and profound attenuation of gut pathology. They suggest, for the first time, a link between microglia and certain microbial communities that may have implications for treatment of hypertension.},

We analyzed data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009 to 2012, 2013 to 2016, and 2017 to 2020 to confirm this finding. {METHODS} Hypertension was defined as systolic {BP} ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic {BP} ≥90 mm Hg and antihypertensive medication use. {BP} control among those with hypertension was defined as systolic {BP} {\textless}140 mm Hg and diastolic {BP} {\textless}90 mm Hg. {RESULTS} The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension was 31.5\% (95\% {CI}, 30.3\%-32.8\%), 32.0\% (95\% {CI}, 30.6\%-33.3\%), and 32.9\% (95\% {CI}, 31.0\%-34.7\%) in 2009 to 2012, 2013 to 2016, and 2017 to 2020, respectively (P trend=0.218). The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension increased among non-Hispanic Asian adults from 27.0\% in 2011 to 2012 to 33.5\% in 2017 to 2020 (P trend=0.003). Among Hispanic adults, the age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension increased from 29.4\% in 2009 to 2012 to 33.2\% in 2017 to 2020 (P trend=0.029). In 2009 to 2012, 2013 to 2016, and 2017 to 2020, 52.8\% (95\% {CI}, 50.0\%-55.7\%), 51.3\% (95\% {CI}, 47.9\%-54.6\%), and 48.2\% (95\% {CI}, 45.7\%-50.8\%) of {US} adults with hypertension had controlled {BP} (P trend=0.034). Among {US} adults taking antihypertensive medication, 69.9\% (95\% {CI}, 67.8\%-72.0\%), 69.3\% (95\% {CI}, 66.6\%-71.9\%), and 67.7\% (95\% {CI}, 65.2\%-70.3\%) had controlled {BP} in 2009 to 2012, 2013 to 2016, and 2017 to 2020, respectively (P trend=0.189). Among all {US} adults with hypertension and those taking antihypertensive medication, a decline in {BP} control between 2009 to 2012 and 2017 to 2020 occurred among those ≥75 years, women, and non-Hispanic black adults. {CONCLUSIONS} These data confirm that the proportion of {US} adults with hypertension who have controlled {BP} has declined.},

Interference with neuroinflammation by an anti-inflammatory reagent or overexpression of interleukin-10 in the brain was found to attenuate hypertension. However, the cellular mechanism of neuroinflammation, as well as its impact on neurogenic regulation of blood pressure, is unclear. Here, we found that hypertension, induced by either angiotensin {II} or l-{NG}-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, is accompanied by microglial activation as manifested by microgliosis and proinflammatory cytokine upregulation. Targeted depletion of microglia significantly attenuated neuroinflammation, glutamate receptor expression in the paraventricular nucleus, plasma vasopressin level, kidney norepinephrine concentration, and blood pressure. Furthermore, when microglia were preactivated and transferred into the brains of normotensive mice, there was a significantly prolonged pressor response to intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin {II}, and inactivation of microglia eliminated these effects. These data demonstrate that microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, are the major cellular factors in mediating neuroinflammation and modulating neuronal excitation, which contributes to the elevated blood pressure.},

Emerging evidence indicates that immune activation is highly involved in the entire progress of hypertension and end organ damage. In addition to immunity, autonomic nervous system, particularly sympathetic nervous system, is one of the most conserved systems to maintain body homeostasis. Immune and sympathetic activities are found simultaneously increased in hypertension, suggesting a synergistic action of these two systems in the progression of this disease. Microglia, the primary immune cells in the central nervous system, have been suggested in the regulation of sympathetic outflow; depletion of microglia alters neuroinflammation and pressor responses in hypertensive models. In this review, we firstly updated the current understanding on microglial ontogeny and functions in both steady state and diseases. Then we reviewed on the interaction between autonomic nervous system and peripheral immunity in hypertension. Microglia bridge the central and peripheral inflammation via regulating the sympathetic nerve activity in hypertension. Future exploration of the molecular linkage of this pathway may provide novel therapeutic angel for hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases.},

This review highlights the importance of the blood–brain barrier in the context of diseases involving autonomic dysfunction, such as hypertension and heart failure. What advances does it highlight? It highlights the potential role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leucocytes and angiotensin {II} in disrupting the blood–brain barrier in cardiovascular diseases. Advances are highlighted in our understanding of neurovascular unit cells, astrocytes and microglia, with a specific emphasis on their pathogenic roles within the brain. The blood–brain barrier ({BBB}) is a crucial barrier that provides both metabolic and physical protection to an immune-privileged {CNS}. The {BBB} has been shown to be disrupted in hypertension. This review addresses the importance of the {BBB} in maintaining homeostasis in the context of diseases related to autonomic dysfunction, such as hypertension. We highlight the potentially important roles of the immune system and neurovascular unit in the maintenance of the {BBB}, whereby dysregulation may lead to autonomic dysfunction in diseases such as heart failure and hypertension. Circulating leucocytes and factors such as angiotensin {II} and pro-inflammatory cytokines are thought ultimately to downregulate endothelial tight junction proteins that are a crucial component of the {BBB}. The specific mechanisms underlying {BBB} disruption and their role in contributing to autonomic dysfunction are not yet fully understood but are a growing area of interest. A greater understanding of these systems and advances in our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms causing {BBB} disruption will allow for the development of future therapeutic interventions in the treatment of autonomic imbalance associated with diseases such as heart failure and hypertension.},

	abstract = {Angiotensin {II} ({AngII}) is a pivotal peptide implicated in the regulation of blood pressure. In addition to its systemic vascular and renal effects, {AngII} acts centrally to modulate the activities of neuroendocrine and sympathetic neuronal networks, influencing in turn sympatho-humoral outflows to the circulation. Moreover, a large body of evidence supports {AngII} signalling dysregulation as a key mechanism contributing to exacerbated sympathoexcitation during hypertension. Due to its hydrophilic actions, circulating {AngII} does not cross the blood-brain barrier ({BBB}), signalling to the brain via the circumventricular organs which lack a tight {BBB}. In this review, we present and discuss recent studies from our laboratory showing that elevated circulating levels of {AngII} during hypertension result in disruption of the {BBB} integrity, allowing access of circulating {AngII} to critical sympathoexcitatory brain centres such as the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the rostral ventrolateral medulla. We propose the novel hypothesis that {AngII}-driven {BBB} breakdown constitutes a complementary mechanism by which circulating {AngII}, working in tandem with the central renin-angiotensin system, further exacerbates sympatho-humoral activation during hypertension. These results are discussed within the context of a growing body of evidence in the literature supporting {AngII} as a pro-inflammatory signal, and brain microglia as key cell targets mediating central {AngII} actions during hypertension.},

There is also growing body of evidence suggesting the potential role of the renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}) in the pathogenesis of small-vessel disease and cognitive impairment. However, the specific contribution of the {RAS} to {BBB} disruption and cognitive impairment remains unclear. We found a significant leakage from brain microvessels in the hippocampus and impaired cognitive functions in angiotensin {II} ({AngII})-infused hypertensive mice, which were associated with increased brain {AngII} levels. These changes were not observed in {AngII}-infused {AT}1a receptor (-/-) mice. We also observed that Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats exhibited hypertension, leakage from brain microvessels in the hippocampus, and impaired cognitive function. In these animals, treatment with an {AngII} receptor blocker, olmesartan, did not alter blood pressure, but markedly ameliorated leakage from brain microvessels and restored the cognitive decline. These data support the hypothesis that {RAS} inhibition attenuates cognitive impairment by reducing {BBB} injury, which is independent of blood pressure changes. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

Intracisternal injections of {IL}-1 caused dose-dependent vasopressor responses, which were accompanied by corresponding increases in the abdominal sympathetic discharge. Blood pressure increased gradually, and attained a peak response at 20 to 30 min. Heart rate also increased dose-de- pendently. Intracerebroventricular pretreatments with indomethacin abolished both the pressor responses and tachycardia. The {IV} injections similarly elicited vasopressor responses with gradual onset, which were also accompanied by corresponding increases in the abdominal sympathetic firings. However, {IL}-1 did not constrict the peripheral vasculature in the perfused hindlimb preparation. Both {IC} and {IV} injections of {IL}-1 increased plasma vasopressin and corticotropin dose-depen- dently after 30 min.

Recent studies have implicated an involvement of {TNF}-α in the development of salt-sensitive hypertension induced by angiotensin {II} (Ang {II}). To understand further the relationship between {TNF}-α and Ang {II}, we examined the responses to Ang {II} in {TNF}-α knockout ({TNF}-α) mice in the present study. A continuous infusion of Ang {II} (1 μg/kg per minute) for 2 weeks was given to both {TNF}-α and wild-type ({WT}) mice with implanted osmotic minipumps. Daily measurement of water intake, salt intake, and urine output were performed using metabolic cages. Blood pressure was monitored continuously with implanted radiotelemetry. Ang {II} administration for 2 weeks caused increases in salt (0.2±0.07 to 5.6±0.95 {mL}/d) and water (5.4±0.34 to 11.5±1.2 {mL}/d) intake and in mean arterial pressure (115±1 to 151±3 mm Hg) in wild-type mice, but these responses were absent in {TNF}-α mice (0.2±0.04 to 0.3±0.09 {mL}/d, 5.5±0.2 to 6.1±0.07 {mL}/d, and 113±2 to 123±3 mm Hg, respectively). Cardiac hypertrophy induced by Ang {II} was significantly attenuated in {TNF}-α mice compared with wild-type mice. In a group of {TNF}-α mice, when replacement therapy was made with recombinant {TNF}-α, Ang {II} induced similar responses in salt appetite, mean arterial pressure, and cardiac hypertrophy, as observed in wild-type mice. These results suggest that {TNF}-α plays a mechanistic role in mediating chronic Ang {II}-induced effects on salt appetite and blood pressure, as well as on cardiac hypertrophy. © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.},

	abstract = {Our previous work indicated that the subfornical organ ({SFO}) is an important brain sensor of blood-borne proinflammatory cytokines, mediating their central effects on autonomic and cardiovascular function. However, the mechanisms by which {SFO} mediates the central effects of circulating proinflammatory cytokines remain unclear. We hypothesized that proinflammatory cytokines act within the {SFO} to upregulate the expression of excitatory and inflammatory mediators that drive sympathetic nerve activity. In urethane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, direct microinjection of tumor necrosis factor ({TNF})-α (25 ng) or interleukin ({IL})-1β (25 ng) into {SFO} increased mean blood pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity within 15 to 20 minutes, mimicking the response to systemically administered proinflammatory cytokines. Pretreatment of {SFO} with microinjections of the angiotensin {II} type-1 receptor blocker losartan (1 μg), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (1 μg) or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor {NS}-398 (2 μg) attenuated those responses. Four hours after the {SFO} microinjection of {TNF}-α (25 ng) or {IL}-1β (25 ng), {mRNA} for angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin {II} type-1 receptor, {TNF}-α and the p55 {TNF}-α receptor, {IL}-1β and the {IL}-1R receptor, and cyclooxygenase-2 had increased in {SFO}, and {mRNA} for angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin {II} type-1 receptor, and cyclooxygenase-2 had increased downstream in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Confocal immunofluorescent images revealed that immunoreactivity for the p55 {TNF}-α receptor and the {IL}-1 receptor accessory protein, a subunit of the {IL}-1 receptor, colocalized with angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin {II} type-1 receptor-like, cyclooxygenase-2, and prostaglandin E2 {EP}3 receptor immunoreactivity in {SFO} neurons. These data suggest that proinflammatory cytokines act within the {SFO} to upregulate the expression of inflammatory and excitatory mediators that drive sympathetic excitation.},

	abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates a key role of inflammation in hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. However, the role of inflammatory processes in neurogenic hypertension remains to be determined. Thus, our objective in the present study was to test the hypothesis that activation of microglial cells and the generation of proinflammatory cytokines in the paraventricular nucleus ({PVN}) contribute to neurogenic hypertension. Intracerebroventricular infusion of minocycline, an anti-inflammatory antibiotic, caused a significant attenuation of mean arterial pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, and plasma norepinephrine induced by chronic angiotensin {II} infusion. This was associated with decreases in the numbers of activated microglia and {mRNAs} for interleukin ({IL}) 1β, {IL}-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, and an increase in the {mRNA} for {IL}-10 in the {PVN}. Overexpression of {IL}-10 induced by recombinant adenoassociated virus-mediated gene transfer in the {PVN} mimicked the antihypertensive effects of minocycline. Furthermore, acute application of a proinflammatory cytokine, {IL}-1β, into the left ventricle or the {PVN} in normal rats resulted in a significant increase in mean arterial pressure. Collectively, this indicates that angiotensin {II} induced hypertension involves activation of microglia and increases in proinflammatory cytokines in the {PVN}. These data have significant implications on the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for the control of neurogenic hypertension. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Increased sympathetic nervous system activity is a hallmark of hypertension ({HTN}), and it is implicated in altered immune system responses in its pathophysiology. However, the precise mechanisms of neural-immune interaction in {HTN} remain elusive. We have previously shown an association between elevated sympathetic drive to the bone marrow ({BM}) and activated {BM} immune cells in rodent models of {HTN}. Moreover, microglial-dependent neuroinflammation is also seen in rodent models of {HTN}. However, the cause-effect relationship between central and systemic inflammatory responses and the sympathetic drive remains unknown. These observations led us to hypothesize that increase in the femoral {BM} sympathetic nerve activity ({fSNA}) initiates a cascade of events leading to increase in blood pressure ({BP}). Here, we investigated the temporal relationship between the {BM} sympathetic drive, activation of the central and peripheral immune system, and increase in {BP} in the events leading to established {HTN}. The present study demonstrates that central infusion of angiotensin {II} ({ANG} {II}) induces early microglial activation in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, which preceded increase in the {fSNA}. In turn, activation of {fSNA} correlated with the timing of increased production and release of {CD}4 $^{\textrm{+}}$ .{IL}17 $^{\textrm{+}}$ T cells and other proinflammatory cells into circulation and elevation in {BP}, whereas infiltration of {CD}4 $^{\textrm{+}}$ cells to the paraventricular nucleus marked establishment of {ANG} {II} {HTN}.

	abstract = {{IL} (Interleukin)-17A is a key inflammatory mediator contributing to chronic tissue inflammation. The present study sought to determine whether {IL}-17A plays a role in regulating neuroinflammation, hemodynamics, and sympathetic outflow in normal and hypertensive animals. In urethane-anesthetized rats, intravenous injection of {IL}-17A induced dramatic and prolonged increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity, which were significantly attenuated by an {IL}-17RA ({IL}-17 receptor A) {siRNA} in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus ({PVN}). Either intracerebroventricular or {PVN} microinjection of {IL}-17A also elicited a similar excitatory response in blood pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity. Intravenous injection of {IL}-17A upregulated the {mRNA} level of {IL}-17A, {IL}-17F, and {IL}-17RA in the {PVN}. Additionally, intravenous injection of {IL}-17A activated brain-resident glial cells and elevated the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the {PVN}, which were markedly diminished by {PVN} microinjection of {IL}-17RA {siRNA}. Pretreatments with microglia or astrocyte inhibitors attenuated the increase in blood pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity in response to {PVN} {IL}-17A. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of {IL}-17A activated {TGF} (transforming growth factor)-β activated kinase 1, p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and transcriptional nuclear factor κB in the {PVN}. {IL}-17A interacted with tumor necrosis factor-α or {IL}-1β synergistically to exaggerate its influence on hemodynamic and sympathetic responses. Central intervention suppressing {IL}-17RA in the {PVN} significantly reduced angiotensin {II}-induced hypertension, neuroinflammation, and sympathetic tone in the rats. Collectively, these data indicated that {IL}-17A in the brain promotes neuroinflammation to advance sympathetic activation and hypertension, probably by a synergistic mechanism involving the interaction with various inflammatory mediators within the brain.},

	abstract = {{APPIAN} is an automated pipeline for user-friendly and reproducible analysis of positron emission tomography ({PET}) images with the aim of automating all processing steps up to the statistical analysis of measures derived from the final output images. The three primary processing steps are coregistration of {PET} images to T1-weighted magnetic resonance ({MR}) images, partial-volume correction ({PVC}), and quantification with tracer kinetic modeling. While there are alternate open-source {PET} pipelines, none offers all of the features necessary for making automated {PET} analysis as reliably, flexibly and easily extendible as possible. To this end, a novel method for automated quality control ({QC}) has been designed to facilitate reliable, reproducible research by helping users verify that each processing stage has been performed as expected. Additionally, a web browser-based {GUI} has been implemented to allow both the 3D visualization of the output images, as well as plots describing the quantitative results of the analyses performed by the pipeline. {APPIAN} also uses flexible region of interest ({ROI}) definition—with both volumetric and, optionally, surface-based {ROI}—to allow users to analyze data from a wide variety of experimental paradigms, e.g., longitudinal lesion studies, large cross-sectional population studies, multi-factorial experimental designs, etc. Finally, {APPIAN} is designed to be modular so that users can easily test new algorithms for {PVC} or quantification or add entirely new analyses to the basic pipeline. We validate the accuracy of {APPIAN} against the Monte-Carlo simulated {SORTEO} database and show that, after {PVC}, {APPIAN} recovers radiotracer concentrations within 93–100\% accuracy.},

The aim of the present study was to compare {BP} measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based device to a standard sphygmomanometer device. Males and females were recruited from within the general population who arrived at a public {BP} screening station. One to two measurements were taken from each using a sphygmomanometer-based and the photoplethysmography-based devices. Devices were considered equal if the mean difference between paired measurements was below 5\&nbsp;{mmHg} and the Standard Deviation ({SD}) was no greater than 8\&nbsp;{mmHg}. Agreement and reliability analyses were also performed. 1057 subjects were included in the study analysis. There were no adverse events during the study. The mean (± {SD}) difference between paired measurements for all subjects was -0.1 ± 3.6\&nbsp;{mmHg} for the systolic and 0.0 ± 3.5\&nbsp;{mmHg} for the diastolic readings. We found 96.31\% agreement in identifying hypertension and an Interclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.99 and 0.97 for systolic and diastolic measurements, respectively. The photoplethysmography-based device was found similar to the gold-standard sphygmomanometer-based device with high agreement and reliability levels. The device might enable a reliable, more convenient method for repeated {BP} monitoring.},

However, race in {eGFR} equations is a social and not a biologic construct. {METHODS} We developed new {eGFR} equations without race using data from two development data sets: 10 studies (8254 participants, 31.5\% Black) for serum creatinine and 13 studies (5352 participants, 39.7\% Black) for both serum creatinine and cystatin C. In a validation data set of 12 studies (4050 participants, 14.3\% Black), we compared the accuracy of new {eGFR} equations to measured {GFR}. We projected the prevalence of chronic kidney disease ({CKD}) and {GFR} stages in a sample of U.S. adults, using current and new equations. {RESULTS} In the validation data set, the current creatinine equation that uses age, sex, and race overestimated measured {GFR} in Blacks (median, 3.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.8 to 5.4) and to a lesser degree in non-Blacks (median, 0.5 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% {CI}, 0.0 to 0.9). When the adjustment for Black race was omitted from the current {eGFR} equation, measured {GFR} in Blacks was underestimated (median, 7.1 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% {CI}, 5.9 to 8.8). A new equation using age and sex and omitting race underestimated measured {GFR} in Blacks (median, 3.6 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% {CI}, 1.8 to 5.5) and overestimated measured {GFR} in non-Blacks (median, 3.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% {CI}, 3.4 to 4.4). For all equations, 85\% or more of the {eGFRs} for Blacks and non-Blacks were within 30\% of measured {GFR}. New creatinine-cystatin C equations without race were more accurate than new creatinine equations, with smaller differences between race groups. As compared with the current creatinine equation, the new creatinine equations, but not the new creatinine-cystatin C equations, increased population estimates of {CKD} prevalence among Blacks and yielded similar or lower prevalence among non-Blacks. {CONCLUSIONS} New {eGFR} equations that incorporate creatinine and cystatin C but omit race are more accurate and led to smaller differences between Black participants and non-Black participants than new equations without race with either creatinine or cystatin C alone.

	abstract = {Background: Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease ({CAD}), the main cause of death in women. While association between the two is frequent, limited data exist regarding the feasibility of blood pressure ({BP}) management and outcomes in women across the spectrum of {CAD}. Accordingly, we analyzed patient characteristics, {BP} control rates, and outcomes among hypertensive women with {CAD}, enrolled in The {INternational} {VErapamil} {SR}-trandolapril {STudy} ({INVEST}). Methods: The 11,770 hypertensive women with {CAD} in {INVEST} were studied based on presence (n = 3,879) or absence (n = 7,891) of history of myocardial infarction ({MI}) or coronary revascularization, to evaluate outcomes across risk groups based on severity of {CAD}. Results: Women with prior {MI} or revascularization were older (4 years, p {\textless} 0.0001), were predominantly white (62\% vs. 29\%), and had more associated comorbidities than women without these events. At 24 months, {JNC} {VI} (sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure) {BP} control rates were lower in women with prior {MI} or revascularization (57\% vs. 64\%, p {\textless} 0.0001), despite more intensive antihypertensive therapy. The primary outcome (first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal {MI}, or nonfatal stroke) was also more frequent in women with prior {MI} or revascularization (adjusted hazard ratio [{HR}] 1.53, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.34-1.74), who were 42\% more likely to die (adjusted {HR} 1.42; 95\% {CI} 1.22-1.64), twice as likely to have a nonfatal {MI} (adjusted {HR} 2.4, 95\% {CI} 1.64-3.51), and 56\% more likely to have a nonfatal stroke (adjusted {HR} 1.56, 95\% {CI} 1.1-2.21). Conclusions: In a prospective, multinational cohort of hypertensive women with {CAD}, those with prior {MI} or revascularization comprised a group at higher risk for death, nonfatal {MI}, and nonfatal stroke, and were less likely to have their {BP} controlled, despite more aggressive therapy. The feasibility and benefit of reducing {BP} to {\textless}130/80 {mmHg} in women, particularly with more severe {CAD}, warrant further investigation.},

A total of 102 patients were randomized, and mean age was 63 years, 52\% female and 75\% Caucasian. Attended and unattended {SBP} was 125.4 ± 20.4 and 122.6 ± 21.0 mm Hg, mean ± {SD}, respectively. Routine clinic {SBP} was 130.6 ± 23.6 mm Hg. Attended {SBP} was 2.7 mm Hg higher than the unattended measurement (95\% {CI} 1.3-4.1; P =.0002). Routine clinic {SBP} was 5.2 mm Hg higher than attended {SBP} (95\% {CI} 2.4-8.0; P =.0003) and 8.0 mm Hg higher than unattended {SBP} (95\% {CI} 5.4-10.5; P {\textless}.0001). Attended measurement of {BP} is significantly higher than unattended measurement and the difference is physiologically meaningful, even in a {CVD} cohort with generally well-controlled hypertension. Furthermore, routine clinic {SBP} substantially overestimates both attended and unattended automated {SBP}, with important implications for treatment decisions like dose and/or drug escalation.},

We hypothesized that older women with hypertension and {CAD} may not derive long-term benefit by achieving systolic {BP} ({SBP}) {\textless} 130 {mmHg}. Methods: We analyzed long-term all-cause mortality data from the International Verapamil {SR}/Trandolapril Study ({INVEST}), stratified by risk attributable to clinical severity of {CAD} (women with prior coronary events of myocardial infarction or revascularization considered high risk, all others at low risk) and by age group (50–64 or ≥65 years). The prognostic impact of achieving mean in-trial {SBP} {\textless}130 (referent group) was compared with 130–139 and ≥ 140 {mmHg} using Cox proportional hazards, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Results: {SBPs} {\textless}130, 130–139, and ≥140 were achieved in 2960, 3024, and 3232 women, respectively. Among high-risk women aged ≥65 years, those achieving {SBP} 130–139 {mmHg} had lower mortality up to 16.7 years later than those with {SBP} {\textless}130 (hazard ratio [{HR}] 0.81, 95\% {CI} 0.69–0.96). High-risk women aged 50–64 achieving {SBP} 130–139 had a similar mortality risk as those with {SBP} {\textless}130 ({HR} 1.21, 95\% {CI} 0.87–1.68), while those achieving {SBP} ≥140 {mmHg} had a higher mortality risk than {SBP} {\textless} 130 ({HR} 1.92, 95\% {CI} 1.37–2.68). A similar pattern was observed among low-risk women ≥65 and {\textless}65 years old. Conclusion: Among women ≥65 years old with hypertension and prior coronary events, in-trial {SBP} between 130 and 139 {mmHg} was associated with lower mortality over the long term versus {SBP} {\textless}130 {mmHg}.},

	abstract = {Importance: Accumulating evidence indicates that higher blood pressure ({BP}) variability from one physician office visit to the next (hereafter referred to as visit-to-visit {BP} variability) is associated with poor outcomes. Short-term measurement (throughout 1 year) of visit-to-visit {BP} variability in high-risk older patients may help identify patients at increased risk of death. Objective: To evaluate whether short-term visit-to-visit {BP} variability is associated with increased long-term mortality risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: The {US} cohort of the International Verapamil {SR}-Trandolapril Study ({INVEST}), a randomized clinical trial of 16688 patients aged 50 years or older with hypertension and coronary artery disease, was conducted between September 2, 1997, and December 15, 2000, with in-trial follow-up through February 14, 2003. The study evaluated a calcium antagonist (sustained-release verapamil plus trandolapril) vs β-blocker (atenolol plus hydrochlorothiazide) treatment strategy. Blood pressure measurement visits were scheduled every 6 weeks for the first 6 months and biannually thereafter. Statistical analysis was performed from September 2, 1997, to May 1, 2014. Exposures: Visit-to-visit systolic {BP} ({SBP}) and diastolic {BP} variability during the first year of enrollment using 4 different {BP} variability measures: standard deviation, coefficient of variation, average real variability, and variability independent of the mean. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause death, assessed via the {US} National Death Index, beginning after the exposure assessment period through May 1, 2014. Results: For the present post hoc analysis, long-term mortality data were available on 16688 patients (9001 women [54\%]; mean [{SD}] age, 66.5 [9.9] years; 45\% White patients, 16\% Black patients, and 37\% Hispanic patients). During a mean ({SD}) follow-up of 10.9 (4.2) years, 5058 patients (30\%) died. All 4 variability measures for {SBP} were significantly associated with long-term mortality after adjustment for baseline demographic characteristics and comorbidities. After comparison of lowest vs highest variability measure quintiles, the magnitude of the association with death remained statistically significant even after adjustment for baseline demographic characteristics and comorbidities (average real variability: adjusted hazard ratio [{aHR}], 1.18; 95\% {CI}, 1.08-1.30; standard deviation: {aHR}, 1.14; 95\% {CI}, 1.04-1.24; coefficient of variation: {aHR}, 1.15; 95\% {CI}, 1.06-1.26; variability independent of the mean: {aHR}, 1.15; 95\% {CI}, 1.05-1.25). The signal was stronger in women compared with men. Associations of diastolic {BP} variability measures with death were weaker than for {SBP} and were not significant after adjustment. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that, in a large population of older patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease, short-term visit-to-visit {SBP} variability was associated with excess long-term mortality, especially for women. Efforts to identify and minimize visit-to-visit {SBP} variability may be important in reducing excess mortality later in life. Trial Registration: {ClinicalTrials}.gov Identifier: {NCT}00133692.},

	abstract = {Introduction Antihypertensive medication nonadherence is a prevalent issue but is very difficult to accurately assess. To clarify this problem among hypertensive patients attending a cardiovascular disease outpatient clinic, we utilized high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ({HPLC}-{MS}) to assess antihypertensive medication adherence and identify trends by sex and drug class. Methods Serum was extracted from blood samples obtained from patients with either drug-controlled or drug resistant hypertension ({RHTN}) and analyzed via {HPLC}-{MS} for antihypertensive drugs which were categorized by drug class as beta blockers, aldosterone antagonists, diuretics, {ACE} inhibitor/{ARBs}, or calcium channel blockers. Clinic blood pressure ({BP}), sex, and prescription regimens were extracted from medical records at or near the time of blood collection. “Adherence” or “nonadherence” was determined by comparison of the patient's prescribed drug regimen and the presence/absence of prescribed drug(s) in their serum. Results Among 76 patients (47 women; mean age 63; 53\% white), nonadherence was confirmed in 29\%. {RHTN} was more frequently identified in women than men (55\% vs 38\%) and nonadherence was higher in women than men (34\% vs 21\%). {BP} in those who were adherent to prescribed antihypertensive drugs was significantly lower than in those who were nonadherent (129/75 vs 145/83 {mmHg}, p = 0.0015). Overall, {ACE} inhibitors/{ARBs} were associated with the least nonadherence. Among women, nonadherence was highest for aldosterone antagonists, whereas among men, nonadherence was highest for diuretics. Conclusion We observed nonadherence was more frequent among older women in a cohort of {HTN} and {RHTN} patients with cardiovascular disease based on {HPLC}-{MS} confirmed drug levels.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives In 2011, the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services implemented bundling of all services for patients receiving dialysis, including erythropoietin-stimulating agents use, and the Food and Drug Administration recommended conservative erythropoietin-stimulating agent dosing.

Design, setting, participants, \& measurements This retrospective cohort study investigated anemia care and clinical outcomes before and after the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services bundled payment and the revised Food and Drug Administration–recommended erythropoietin-stimulating agent labeling for Medicare-insured adults receiving hemodialysis using data from the United States Renal Data System from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2016. Clinical outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular event (stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality), cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure. Measurements were compared between prepolicy (2006–2010) and postpolicy (2012–2016) implementation using interrupted time series and Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Results Of 481,564 patients, erythropoietin-stimulating agent use immediately decreased by 84.8 per 1000 persons ( P {\textless}0.001), with a significant decrease in the slope of the trend line (both P =0.001). Blood transfusion use rapidly increased by 8.34 per 1000 persons in April 2012 and then gradually decreased (both P =0.001). The percentage of patients with hemoglobin {\textgreater}11 g/dl decreased from 68\% in January 2006 to 28\% in December 2016, whereas those with hemoglobin {\textless}9 g/dl increased from 5\% to 9\%. Overall major adverse cardiovascular event (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.95; 95\% confidence interval, 0.94 to 0.96), stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95\% confidence interval, 0.80 to 0.86), all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.89), cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.81; 95\% confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.83), and heart failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.86; 95\% confidence interval, 0.84 to 0.88) risks were lower. Acute myocardial infarction risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.06) was higher after policies changed.

Conclusions The Medicare reimbursement policy and Food and Drug Administration–recommended erythropoietin-stimulating agent dosing changes were associated with lower erythropoietin-stimulating agent use and lower hemoglobin levels. These changes in anemia care were associated with lower risks of major adverse cardiovascular event, stroke, mortality, and heart failure but higher risk of acute myocardial infarction among adults receiving hemodialysis.},

	abstract = {Temporary disruptions in routine and nonemergency medical care access and delivery have been observed during periods of considerable community transmission of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) (1). However, medical care delay or avoidance might increase morbidity and mortality risk associated with treatable and preventable health conditions and might contribute to reported excess deaths directly or indirectly related to {COVID}-19 (2). To assess delay or avoidance of urgent or emergency and routine medical care because of concerns about {COVID}-19, a web-based survey was administered by Qualtrics, {LLC}, during June 24-30, 2020, to a nationwide representative sample of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years. Overall, an estimated 40.9\% of U.S. adults have avoided medical care during the pandemic because of concerns about {COVID}-19, including 12.0\% who avoided urgent or emergency care and 31.5\% who avoided routine care. The estimated prevalence of urgent or emergency care avoidance was significantly higher among the following groups: unpaid caregivers for adults* versus noncaregivers (adjusted prevalence ratio [{aPR}] = 2.9); persons with two or more selected underlying medical conditions † versus those without those conditions ({aPR} = 1.9); persons with health insurance versus those without health insurance ({aPR} = 1.8); non-Hispanic Black (Black) adults ({aPR} = 1.6) and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) adults ({aPR} = 1.5) versus non-Hispanic White (White) adults; young adults aged 18-24 years versus adults aged 25-44 years ({aPR} = 1.5); and persons with disabilities § versus those without disabilities ({aPR} = 1.3). Given this widespread reporting of medical care avoidance because of {COVID}-19 concerns, especially among persons at increased risk for severe {COVID}-19, urgent efforts are warranted to ensure delivery of services that, if deferred, could result in patient harm. Even during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, persons experiencing a medical emergency should seek and be provided care without delay (3).},

	abstract = {Importance: Following reductions in {US} ambulatory care early in the pandemic, it remains unclear whether care consistently returned to expected rates across insurance types and services. Objective: To assess whether patients with Medicaid or Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility had significantly lower than expected return to use of ambulatory care rates than patients with commercial, Medicare Advantage, or Medicare fee-for-service insurance. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective cohort study examining ambulatory care service patterns from January 1, 2019, through February 28, 2021, claims data from multiple {US} payers were combined using the Milliman {MedInsight} research database. Using a difference-in-differences design, the extent to which utilization during the pandemic differed from expected rates had the pandemic not occurred was estimated. Changes in utilization rates between January and February 2020 and each subsequent 2-month time frame during the pandemic were compared with the changes in the corresponding months from the year prior. Age- and sex-adjusted Poisson regression models of monthly utilization counts were used, offsetting for total patient-months and stratifying by service and insurance type. Exposures: Patients with Medicaid or Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility compared with patients with commercial, Medicare Advantage, or Medicare fee-for-service insurance, respectively. Main Outcomes and Measures: Utilization rates per 100 people for 6 services: emergency department, office and urgent care, behavioral health, screening colonoscopies, screening mammograms, and contraception counseling or {HIV} screening. Results: More than 14.5 million {US} adults were included (mean age, 52.7 years; 54.9\% women). In the March-April 2020 time frame, the combined use of 6 ambulatory services declined to 67.0\% (95\% {CI}, 66.9\%-67.1\%) of expected rates, but returned to 96.7\% (95\% {CI}, 96.6\%-96.8\%) of expected rates by the November-December 2020 time frame. During the second {COVID}-19 wave in the January-February 2021 time frame, overall utilization again declined to 86.2\% (95\% {CI}, 86.1\%-86.3\%) of expected rates, with colonoscopy remaining at 65.0\% (95\% {CI}, 64.1\%-65.9\%) and mammography at 79.2\% (95\% {CI}, 78.5\%-79.8\%) of expected rates. By the January-February 2021 time frame, overall utilization returned to expected rates as follows: patients with Medicaid at 78.4\% (95\% {CI}, 78.2\%-78.7\%), Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility at 73.3\% (95\% {CI}, 72.8\%-73.8\%), commercial at 90.7\% (95\% {CI}, 90.5\%-90.9\%), Medicare Advantage at 83.2\% (95\% {CI}, 81.7\%-82.2\%), and Medicare fee-for-service at 82.0\% (95\% {CI}, 81.7\%-82.2\%; P {\textless}.001; comparing return to expected utilization rates among patients with Medicaid and Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility, respectively, with each of the other insurance types). Conclusions and Relevance: Between March 2020 and February 2021, aggregate use of 6 ambulatory care services increased after the preceding decrease in utilization that followed the onset of the {COVID}-19 pandemic. However, the rate of increase in use of these ambulatory care services was significantly lower for participants with Medicaid or Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility than for those insured by commercial, Medicare Advantage, or Medicare fee-for-service.},

	abstract = {Background: Acute kidney injury ({AKI}) is a common complication in hospitalized patients and a common cause for chronic kidney disease ({CKD}) and increased hospital cost and mortality. By timely detection of {AKI} and {AKI} progression, effective preventive or therapeutic measures could be offered. This study aims to develop and validate an electronic phenotype to identify patients with {CKD} and {AKI}. Methods: A database with electronic health records data from a retrospective study cohort of 84,352 hospitalized adults was created. This repository includes demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory values, medications, diagnoses and procedure codes for all index admission, 12 months prior and 12 months follow-up encounters. We developed algorithms to identify {CKD} and {AKI} based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes ({KDIGO}) criteria. To measure diagnostic performance of the algorithms, clinician experts performed clinical adjudication of {AKI} and {CKD} on 300 selected cases. Results: Among 149,136 encounters, identified {CKD} by medical history was 12\% which increased to 16\% using creatinine criteria. Among 130,081 encounters with sufficient data for {AKI} phenotyping 21\% had {AKI}. The comparison of {CKD} phenotyping algorithm to manual chart review yielded {PPV} of 0.87, {NPV} of 0.99, sensitivity of 0.99, and specificity of 0.89. The comparison of {AKI} phenotyping algorithm to manual chart review yielded {PPV} of 0.99, {NPV} of 0.95 , sensitivity 0.98, and specificity 0.98. Conclusions: We developed phenotyping algorithms that yielded very good performance in identification of patients with {CKD} and {AKI} in validation cohort.

	abstract = {Purpose: Ticagrelor increases serum adenosine concentrations, slowing conduction and possibly leading to bradycardia. Clinical trial data have shown numerically, though not statistically significantly, higher rates of bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel. Additionally, recent case reports have further raised concerns for this adverse effect. We explored the association between ticagrelor and hospitalization for bradycardia in a real-world setting. Methods: We conducted a population-based, nested case–control study of Ontario residents, 66 years of age or older, discharged after a first acute coronary syndrome by linking multiple healthcare databases. Cases included patients hospitalized for bradycardia within 1 year of starting a P2Y12 inhibitor. For each case, we identified 4 controls matched on age, sex, index date, and current use of a P2Y12 inhibitor. The exposure of interest was a prescription for ticagrelor within 90 days, with clopidogrel use as the reference group. Results: From April 2012 to March 2014, we identified 140 cases and 560 controls who met the study criteria. We found no significant association between bradycardia and exposure to ticagrelor relative to clopidogrel in the previous 90 days prior to the index date (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, 95\% confidence interval 0.65–2.21). Further adjustment for potential confounders also did not identify a significant association. Conclusions: Among older patients with a first acute coronary syndrome, use of ticagrelor was not associated with a greater risk of admission for bradycardia relative to clopidogrel.

	abstract = {Objectives To estimate and compare the risk of emergent bradycardia associated with starting immediate-release ({IR}) and slow-release ({SR}) formulations of metoprolol. Design Retrospective analysis of administrative claims data. Data Source State of California Medicaid program (Medi-Cal) claims database. Patients A total of 31,574 adults beginning metoprolol between May 1, 2004, and November 1, 2009, without a pharmacy claim for a β blocker within the previous 6 months of metoprolol initiation; patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of symptomatic bradycardia, pacemaker, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement before metoprolol initiation were excluded. Measurements and Main Results The study outcome was the time to first occurrence of emergent bradycardia, measured at an emergency department visit or hospitalization due to diagnosis of symptomatic bradycardia, after metoprolol initiation. We calculated the incidence and compared the risk of emergent bradycardia by using a proportional hazards model that included the metoprolol formulation with adjustment for total daily metoprolol dose and the use of other drugs as time-varying covariates, as well as demographics and comorbidities. Among 31,574 patients starting metoprolol, 18,516 (58.6\%) used the {IR} formulation. The incidence of emergent bradycardia was 19.1/1000 person-years overall but was nearly twice as common in patients using the {IR} versus the {SR} formulation (24.1/1000 person-yrs in the {IR} group versus 12.9/1000 person-yrs in the {SR} group, unadjusted hazard ratio [{HR}] 1.81, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.28-2.56). Adjustment for other drugs also associated with symptomatic bradycardia (cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors, class I or {III} antiarrhythmics, and atrioventricular node-blocking agents), metoprolol dose, and other participant characteristics somewhat attenuated the association (adjusted {HR} 1.48, 95\% {CI} 1.03-2.13). Conclusion The risk of emergent bradycardia associated with metoprolol initiation was higher with the {IR} formulation than the {SR} formulation, although the absolute risk was low. © 2013 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.},

	abstract = {Importance: Reflex syncope is the major cause of transient loss of consciousness, which affects one-third of the population, but effective treatment for individuals with severe syncope is lacking. Better understanding of reflex syncope predisposition may offer new therapeutic solutions. Objectives: To determine the familial risk of syncope in first-, second-, and third-degree relatives of affected individuals and to explore the role of genes and family environment in reflex syncope. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this national population-based family cohort study, the Swedish multigeneration register was linked to 3 Swedish nationwide registers: hospital discharge, outpatient care, and primary care registers for the period from 1997 to 2015. Sibling pairs born to Swedish parents between 1948 and 2005 were included. Linkage was also made to half-siblings and cousins. Data analysis was performed from June to October 2020. Exposures: Register-based syncope diagnosis among relatives: pairs of twins, siblings, half-siblings, and cousins. Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds ratios for syncope were calculated for relatives (twins, siblings, half-siblings, and cousins) of individuals who had syncope compared with relatives of individuals without syncope for reference. Sensitivity analysis excluding families with definite nonreflex syncope diagnosis was performed. Results: Among the study population of 2694442 participants, 1381453 (51.3\%) were male, and the median (interquartile range) age was 32 (22-43) years. The study population consisted of 24020 twins, 1546108 siblings, 264244 half-siblings, and 1044546 cousins. In total, 61861 (2.30\%) unique individuals were diagnosed with syncope. Sixty-two percent (38226) of the syncope-positive individuals were female. The odds ratio ({OR}) for syncope was 2.39 (95\% {CI}, 1.61-3.53) for twins, 1.81 (95\% {CI}, 1.71-1.91) for siblings, 1.28 (95\% {CI}, 1.20-1.37) for half-siblings, and 1.13 (95\% {CI}, 1.10-1.17) for cousins of individuals with syncope. The {OR} was highest among male twins at 5.03 (95\% {CI}, 2.57-9.85). The proportion of syncope-positive individuals was consistently higher in women vs men, regardless of degree of relationship (twins: 346 [2.88\%] vs 193 [1.61\%]; siblings: 22111 [2.92\%] vs 13419 [1.70\%], half-siblings: 4148 [3.44\%] vs 2425 [1.93\%], cousins: 14498 [2.87\%] vs 9246 [1.72\%]). Exclusion of nonreflex syncope diagnoses did not change syncope risk in affected families. Conclusions and Relevance: In this Swedish national population-based study, the risk of syncope among relatives of affected individuals was associated with the relationship degree and was strongest in twins and siblings, which suggests that there are genetic components of reflex syncope. Women were more likely to experience syncope independently of family relationship. A better understanding of genetic predisposition to reflex syncope may offer new therapeutic options in severely affected individuals.},

	abstract = {Background: Hypertensive emergency ({HTNE}) diagnostic code was introduced, in the {US}, in October 2016 to improve identification of patients with end-organ damage due to high blood pressure but its impact is unclear.  Objective: To assess the accuracy of {HTNE} code using administrative data.  Methods: We used National Inpatient Sample 2017 to identify adult patients, age ≥18 years, with International Classification of Disease-10th Clinical modification ({ICD}-10-{CM}) code of I16.1. We used the presence of end-organ damage diagnostic codes to identify true {HTNE}.  Results: A total of 194,495 patients had a diagnosis of {HTNE}. Of these only 144,070 (74.1\%) had a concomitant diagnosis of end-organ damage. Baseline characteristics of entire cohort stratified by presence of target organ damage (Table 1A) and frequency of end-organ damage in true {HTNE} patients (Table 1B) are shown. Patients with true {HTNE} were likely to be older and male with higher co-morbidity burden. There was also significant difference in outcomes between two groups with a higher proportion of true {HTNE} patients experiencing longer length of stay and increased mortality which is in-line with previous studies.  Conclusions: The accuracy of hypertensive emergency diagnosis code is low with positive predictive value of 74.1\% and caution is advised when using with administrative data. Further studies, using individual patient discharge records, are required to validate {HTNE} code.},

Telemedicine use was lower in communities with higher rates of poverty (31.9 percent versus 27.9 percent for the lowest and highest quartiles of poverty rate, respectively). Across specialties, the use of any telemedicine during the pandemic ranged from 68 percent of endocrinologists to 9 percent of ophthalmologists. Across common conditions, the percentage of visits provided during the pandemic via telemedicine ranged from 53 percent for depression to 3 percent for glaucoma.

Objective: To examine changes in health care use during the first 2 months of the {COVID}-19 pandemic in March and April of 2020 relative to March and April of 2019 and 2018, and to examine whether changes in use differ by patient's zip code-level race/ethnicity or income. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed health insurance claims for patients from all 50 {US} states who receive health insurance through their employers. Changes in use of preventive services, nonelective care, elective procedures, prescription drugs, in-person office visits, and telemedicine visits were examined during the first 2 months of the {COVID}-19 pandemic in 2020 relative to existing trends in 2019 and 2018. Disparities in the association of the pandemic with health care use based on patient's zip code-level race and income were also examined. Results: Data from 5.6, 6.4, and 6.8 million {US} individuals with employer-sponsored insurance in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, were analyzed. Patient demographics were similar in all 3 years (mean [{SD}] age, 34.3 [18.6] years in 2018, 34.3 [18.5] years in 2019, and 34.5 [18.5] years in 2020); 50.0\% women in 2018, 49.5\% women in 2019, and 49.5\% women in 2020). In March and April 2020, regression-adjusted use rate per 10000 persons changed by -28.2 (95\% {CI}, -30.5 to -25.9) and -64.5 (95\% {CI}, -66.8 to -62.2) for colonoscopies; -149.1 (95\% {CI}, -162.0 to -16.2) and -342.1 (95\% {CI}, -355.0 to -329.2) for mammograms; -60.0 (95\% {CI}, -63.3 to -54.7) and -118.1 (95\% {CI}, -112.4 to -113.9) for hemoglobin A1ctests; -300.5 (95\% {CI}, -346.5 to -254.5) and -369.0 (95\% {CI}, -414.7 to -323.4) for child vaccines; -4.6 (95\% {CI}, -5.3 to -3.9) and -10.9 (95\% {CI}, -11.6 to -10.2) for musculoskeletal surgery; -1.1 (95\% {CI}, -1.4 to -0.7) and -3.4 (95\% {CI}, -3.8 to -3.0) for cataract surgery; -13.4 (95\% {CI}, -14.6 to -12.2) and -31.4 (95\% {CI}, -32.6 to -30.2) for magnetic resonance imaging; and -581.1 (95\% {CI}, -612.9 to -549.3) and -1465 (95\% {CI}, -1496 to -1433) for in-person office visits. Use of telemedicine services increased by 227.9 (95\% {CI}, 221.7 to 234.1) per 10000 persons and 641.6 (95\% {CI}, 635.5 to 647.8) per 10000 persons. Patients living in zip codes with lower-income or majority racial/ethnic minority populations experienced smaller reductions in in-person visits (≥80\% racial/ethnic minority zip code: 200.0 per 10000 [95\% {CI}, 128.9-270.1]; 79\%-21\% racial/ethnic minority zip code: 54.2 per 10000 [95\% {CI}, 33.6-74.9]) but also had lower rates of adoption of telemedicine (≥80\% racial/ethnic minority zip code: -71.6 per 10000 [95\% {CI}, -87.6 to -55.5]; 79\%-21\% racial/ethnic minority zip code: -15.1 per 10000 [95\% {CI}, -19.8 to -10.4]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of a large {US} population with employer-sponsored insurance, the first 2 months of the {COVID}-19 pandemic were associated with dramatic reductions in the use of preventive and elective care. Use of telemedicine increased rapidly but not enough to account for reductions in in-person primary care visits. Race and income disparities at the zip code level exist in use of telemedicine..},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Drug-related adverse events associated with antihypertensive therapy may result in subsequent prescribing of other potentially harmful medications, known as prescribing cascades. The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude and characteristics of a beta-blocker-edema-loop diuretic prescribing cascade. {METHODS}: A prescription sequence symmetry analysis was used to assess loop diuretic initiation before and after initiation of beta-blockers among patients 20 years or older without heart failure, atrial fibrillation, other arrythmias, or use of calcium channel blocker within a U.S. private insurance claims database (2005-2018). The temporality of loop diuretic initiation relative to a beta-blocker or negative control (renin-angiotensin system blocker) initiation was tabulated. Secular trend-adjusted sequence ratios ({aSRs}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}) compared the initiation of loop diuretic 90 days before and after initiation of beta-blockers. {RESULTS}: Among 988,675 beta-blocker initiators, 9,489 patients initiated a new loop diuretic prescription 90 days after and 5,245 patients before beta-blocker initiation, resulting in an {aSR} of 1.78 (95\% {CI}, 1.72-1.84). An estimated 1.72 beta-blocker initiators per 100 patient-years experienced the prescribing cascade in the first 90 days.

Negative control results ({aSR} 1.09, 95\% {CI}, 1.05-1.13) generally corroborated our findings, but suggested modest within-person time-varying confounding. {CONCLUSIONS}: We observed excess use of loop diuretics following beta-blocker initiation that was only partially explained by secular trends or hypertension progression.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Phenotyping algorithms applied to electronic health record ({EHR}) data enable investigators to identify large cohorts for clinical and genomic research. Algorithm development is often iterative, depends on fallible investigator intuition, and is time- and labor-intensive. We developed and evaluated 4 types of phenotyping algorithms and categories of {EHR} information to identify hypertensive individuals and controls and provide a portable module for implementation at other sites. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We reviewed the {EHRs} of 631 individuals followed at Vanderbilt for hypertension status. We developed features and phenotyping algorithms of increasing complexity. Input categories included International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ({ICD}9) codes, medications, vital signs, narrative-text search results, and Unified Medical Language System ({UMLS}) concepts extracted using natural language processing ({NLP}). We developed a module and tested portability by replicating 10 of the best-performing algorithms at the Marshfield Clinic. {RESULTS}: Random forests using billing codes, medications, vitals, and concepts had the best performance with a median area under the receiver operator characteristic curve ({AUC}) of 0.976. Normalized sums of all 4 categories also performed well (0.959 {AUC}). The best non-{NLP} algorithm combined normalized {ICD}9 codes, medications, and blood pressure readings with a median {AUC} of 0.948. Blood pressure cutoffs or {ICD}9 code counts alone had {AUCs} of 0.854 and 0.908, respectively. Marshfield Clinic results were similar. {CONCLUSION}: This work shows that billing codes or blood pressure readings alone yield good hypertension classification performance. However, even simple combinations of input categories improve performance. The most complex algorithms classified hypertension with excellent recall and precision.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: This study investigated the effect of catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation ({RD}) on central hemodynamics in patients with resistant hypertension. {BACKGROUND}: High central blood pressure ({BP}) increases cardiovascular events and mortality independently of peripheral {BP}. The effect of {RD} on central {BP} is unclear. {METHODS}: A total of 110 patients underwent bilateral {RD}. Radial artery applanation tonometry and pulse wave analysis were used to derive central aortic pressure and hemodynamic indices at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after ablation. Ten patients with resistant hypertension not undergoing {RD} served as controls. {RESULTS}: {RD} significantly reduced mean central aortic {BP} from 167/92 mm Hg to 149/88 mm Hg, 147/85 mm Hg, and 141/85 mm Hg at 1, 3, and 6 months (p {\textless} 0.001), respectively. Aortic pulse pressure decreased from 76.2 +/- 23.3 mm Hg to 61.5 +/- 17.5 mm Hg, 62.7 +/- 18.1 mm Hg, and 54.5 +/- 15.7 mm Hg 1, 3, and 6 months after {RD} (p {\textless} 0.001), respectively. Six months after {RD} aortic augmentation and augmentation index were significantly reduced by -11 mm Hg (p {\textless} 0.001) and -5.3\% (p {\textless} 0.001), respectively. Carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity showed a significant reduction from 11.6 +/- 3.2 m/s to 9.6 +/- 3.1 m/s at 6 months (p {\textless} 0.001). Consistently, ejection duration and aortic systolic pressure load were significantly diminished, indicating improvement of cardiac work load by {RD}. No significant changes were obtained in control patients. {CONCLUSIONS}: Besides the known effect of {RD} on brachial blood pressure, the study showed for the first time that this novel approach significantly improves arterial stiffness and central hemodynamics, which might have important prognostic implications in patients with resistant hypertension at high cardiovascular risk.},

We investigated whether therapy targeting normal systolic pressure (i.e., {\textless}120 mm Hg) reduces major cardiovascular events in participants with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. {METHODS}: A total of 4733 participants with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to intensive therapy, targeting a systolic pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, or standard therapy, targeting a systolic pressure of less than 140 mm Hg. The primary composite outcome was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The mean follow-up was 4.7 years. {RESULTS}: After 1 year, the mean systolic blood pressure was 119.3 mm Hg in the intensive-therapy group and 133.5 mm Hg in the standard-therapy group. The annual rate of the primary outcome was 1.87\% in the intensive-therapy group and 2.09\% in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio with intensive therapy, 0.88; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.73 to 1.06; P=0.20).

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Guidelines generally recommend intensive lowering of blood pressure ({BP}) in patients with type 2 diabetes. There is uncertainty about the impact of this strategy on case-specific events. Thus, we generated estimates of the effects of {BP} reduction on the risk of myocardial infarction ({MI}) and stroke in diabetic patients. {METHODS}: We selected studies which compared different {BP}-lowering agents and different {BP} intervention strategies in patients with diabetes. Outcome measures were {MI} and stroke. We abstracted information about study design, intervention, population, outcomes, and methodological quality for a total of 73,913 patients with diabetes (295,652 patient-years of exposure) randomized in 31 intervention trials. {RESULTS}: Overall, experimental treatment reduced the risk of stroke by 9\% (P = 0.0059), and that of {MI} by 11\% (P = 0.0015). Allocation to more-tight, compared with less-tight, {BP} control reduced the risk of stroke by 31\% [relative risk ({RR}) 0.61, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.48-0.79], whereas the reduction in the risk of {MI} approached, but did not achieve, significance [odds ratio ({OR}) 0.87, 95\% {CI} 0.74-1.02]. In a meta-regression analysis, the risk of stroke decreased by 13\% (95\% {CI} 5-20, P = 0.002) for each 5-{mmHg} reduction in {SBP}, and by 11.5\% (95\% {CI} 5-17, P {\textless} 0.001) for each 2-{mmHg} reduction in {DBP}. In contrast, the risk of {MI} did not show any association with the extent of {BP} reduction ({SBP}: P = 0.793; {DBP}: P = 0.832). {CONCLUSION}: In patients with diabetes, protection from stroke increases with the magnitude of {BP} reduction.

	abstract = {Background: Effects of blood pressure reduction in persons with grade 1 hypertension are unclear. Purpose: To investigate whether pharmacologic blood pressure reduction prevents cardiovascular events and deaths in persons with grade 1 hypertension. Data Sources: Trials included in the {BPLTTC} (Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration) and trials identified from a previous review and electronic database searches. Study Selection: Patients without cardiovascular disease with blood pressures in the grade 1 hypertension range (140 to 159/90 to 99 mm Hg) who were randomly assigned to an active (antihypertensive drug or more intensive regimen) or control (placebo or less intensive regimen) blood pressure-lowering regimen. Data Extraction: Individual-patient data from {BPLTTC} trials and aggregate data from other trials were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed for all trials. Data Synthesis: Individual-patient data involved 10 comparisons from trials where most patients had diabetes, and aggregate data involved 3 comparisons from trials of patients without diabetes. The average blood pressure reduction was about 3.6/2.4 mm Hg. Over 5 years, odds ratios were 0.86 (95\% {CI}, 0.74 to 1.01) for total cardiovascular events, 0.72 ({CI}, 0.55 to 0.94) for strokes, 0.91 ({CI}, 0.74 to 1.12) for coronary events, 0.80 ({CI}, 0.57 to 1.12) for heart failure, 0.75 ({CI}, 0.57 to 0.98) for cardiovascular deaths, and 0.78 ({CI}, 0.67 to 0.92) for total deaths. Results were similar in secondary analyses. Withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects was more common in the active groups. Limitation: Blood pressure reductions and numbers of events were small. Conclusion: Blood pressure-lowering therapy is likely to prevent stroke and death in patients with uncomplicated grade 1 hypertension.

Individual participant data or group tabular data were provided by each trial and combined by standard statistical techniques.{\textbar}The overview of placebo-controlled trials of {ACE} inhibitors (four trials, 12,124 patients mostly with coronary heart disease) revealed reductions in stroke (30\% [95\% {CI} 15-43]), coronary heart disease (20\% [11-28]), and major cardiovascular events (21\% [14-27]). The overview of placebo-controlled trials of calcium antagonists (two trials, 5520 patients mostly with hypertension) showed reductions in stroke (39\% [15-56]) and major cardiovascular events (28\% [13-41]). In the overview of trials comparing blood-pressure-lowering strategies of different intensity (three trials, 20,408 patients with hypertension), there were reduced risks of stroke (20\% [2-35]), coronary heart disease (19\% [2-33]), and major cardiovascular events (15\% [4-24]) with more intensive therapy. In the overviews comparing different antihypertensive regimens (eight trials, 37,872 patients with hypertension), several differences in cause-specific effects were seen between calcium-antagonist-based therapy and other regimens, but each was of borderline significance.{\textbar}Strong evidence of benefits of {ACE} inhibitors and calcium antagonists is provided by the overviews of placebo-controlled trials. There is weaker evidence of differences between treatment regimens of differing intensities and of differences between treatment regimens based on different drug classes.

A substudy of 274 patients measured atherosclerosis progression by intravascular ultrasound ({IVUS}). {INTERVENTIONS}: Patients were randomized to receive amlodipine, 10 mg; enalapril, 20 mg; or placebo. {IVUS} was performed at baseline and study completion. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The primary efficacy parameter was incidence of cardiovascular events for amlodipine vs placebo. Other outcomes included comparisons of amlodipine vs enalapril and enalapril vs placebo. Events included cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, coronary revascularization, hospitalization for angina pectoris, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, fatal or nonfatal stroke or transient ischemic attack, and new diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease. The {IVUS} end point was change in percent atheroma volume. {RESULTS}: Baseline blood pressure averaged 129/78 mm Hg for all patients; it increased by 0.7/0.6 mm Hg in the placebo group and decreased by 4.8/2.5 mm Hg and 4.9/2.4 mm Hg in the amlodipine and enalapril groups, respectively (P{\textless}.001 for both vs placebo). Cardiovascular events occurred in 151 (23.1\%) placebo-treated patients, in 110 (16.6\%) amlodipine-treated patients (hazard ratio [{HR}], 0.69; 95\% {CI}, 0.54-0.88 [P = .003]), and in 136 (20.2\%) enalapril-treated patients ({HR}, 0.85; 95\% {CI}, 0.67-1.07 [P = .16]. Primary end point comparison for enalapril vs amlodipine was not significant ({HR}, 0.81; 95\% {CI}, 0.63-1.04 [P = .10]). The {IVUS} substudy showed a trend toward less progression of atherosclerosis in the amlodipine group vs placebo (P = .12), with significantly less progression in the subgroup with systolic blood pressures greater than the mean (P = .02). Compared with baseline, {IVUS} showed progression in the placebo group (P{\textless}.001), a trend toward progression in the enalapril group (P = .08), and no progression in the amlodipine group (P = .31). For the amlodipine group, correlation between blood pressure reduction and progression was r = 0.19, P = .07. {CONCLUSIONS}: Administration of amlodipine to patients with {CAD} and normal blood pressure resulted in reduced adverse cardiovascular events. Directionally similar, but smaller and nonsignificant, treatment effects were observed with enalapril. For amlodipine, {IVUS} showed evidence of slowing of atherosclerosis progression.},

Studies were excluded if they were crossover trials. {DATA} {EXTRACTION} {AND} {SYNTHESIS}: Dichotomous outcome data from individual trials were analyzed using the risk ratio ({RR}) measure and its 95\% {CI} with random-effects models. We estimated the difference between the estimates of the subgroups according to tests for interaction. We performed meta-regression analyses to identify sources of heterogeneity. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: Primary end points were all-cause mortality and death from {CV} causes. Secondary end points were the effects of {ACEIs} and {ARBs} on major {CV} events. {RESULTS}: Twenty-three of 35 identified trials compared {ACEIs} with placebo or active drugs (32,827 patients) and 13 compared {ARBs} with no therapy (controls) (23,867 patients). When compared with controls (placebo/active treatment), {ACEIs} significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 13\% ({RR}, 0.87; 95\% {CI}, 0.78-0.98), {CV} deaths by 17\% (0.83; 0.70-0.99), and major {CV} events by 14\% (0.86; 0.77-0.95), including myocardial infarction by 21\% (0.79; 0.65-0.95) and heart failure by 19\% (0.81; 0.71-0.93). Treatment with {ARBs} did not significantly affect all-cause mortality ({RR}, 0.94; 95\% {CI}, 0.82-1.08), {CV} death rate (1.21; 0.81-1.80), and major {CV} events (0.94; 0.85-1.01) with the exception of heart failure (0.70; 0.59-0.82). Both {ACEIs} and {ARBs} were not associated with a decrease in the risk for stroke in patients with {DM}. Meta-regression analysis showed that the {ACEI} treatment effect on all-cause mortality and {CV} death did not vary significantly with the starting baseline blood pressure and proteinuria of the trial participants and the type of {ACEI} and {DM}. {CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduced all-cause mortality, {CV} mortality, and major {CV} events in patients with {DM}, whereas {ARBs} had no benefits on these outcomes.

Shifts where a patient experienced an unplanned transfer were event shifts; shifts without a transfer were comparison shifts. Hospitalization records were transformed into 12-hour shift records, with 10 randomly selected comparison shifts identified for each event shift. Analysis employed logistic regression and split validation. {SETTING}: Integrated healthcare delivery system in Northern California. {PATIENTS}: Hospitalized adults at 14 hospitals with comprehensive inpatient {EMRs}. {MEASUREMENTS}: Predictors included vital signs, laboratory test results, severity of illness scores, longitudinal chronic illness burden scores, transpired hospital length of stay, and care directives. Patients were also given a retrospective, electronically (not manually assigned) Modified Early Warning Score, or {MEWS}(re). Outcomes were transfer to the intensive care unit ({ICU}) from the ward or transitional care unit, or death outside the {ICU} among patients who were "full code". {RESULTS}: We identified 4,036 events and 39,782 comparison shifts from a cohort of 102,422 patients' hospitalizations. The {MEWS}(re) had a c-statistic of 0.709 in the derivation and 0.698 in the validation dataset; corresponding values for the {EMR}-based model were 0.845 and 0.775. {LIMITATIONS}: Using these algorithms requires hospitals with comprehensive inpatient {EMRs} and longitudinal data. {CONCLUSIONS}: {EMR}-based detection of impending deterioration outside the {ICU} is feasible in integrated healthcare delivery systems.},

The addition of new treatments to existing therapies will help achieve blood pressure ({BP}) goals in more resistant hypertension patients. In the current trial, 849 patients with resistant hypertension receiving ≥3 antihypertensive drugs, including a diuretic, at optimized doses were randomized to the selective endothelin A receptor antagonist darusentan, placebo, or the central α-2 agonist guanfacine. The coprimary end points of the study were changes from baseline to week 14 in trough, sitting systolic {BP}, and diastolic {BP} measured in the clinic. Decreases from baseline to week 14 in systolic {BP} for darusentan (-15±14 mm Hg) were greater than for guanfacine (-12±13 mm Hg; P{\textless}0.05) but not greater than placebo (-14±14 mm Hg). Darusentan, however, reduced mean 24-hour systolic {BP} (-9±12 mm Hg) more than placebo (-2±12 mm Hg) or guanfacine (-4±12 mm Hg) after 14 weeks of treatment (P{\textless}0.001 for each comparison). The most frequent adverse event associated with darusentan was fluid retention/edema at 28\% versus 12\% in each of the other groups. More patients withdrew because of adverse events on darusentan as compared with placebo or guanfacine. We conclude that darusentan provided greater reduction in systolic {BP} in resistant hypertension patients as assessed by ambulatory {BP} monitoring, in spite of not meeting its coprimary end points. The results of this trial highlight the importance of ambulatory {BP} monitoring in the design of hypertension clinical studies.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: The coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic forced health systems to offer video and telephone visits as in-person visit alternatives. Although video visits offer some benefits compared with telephone visits, they require complex setup, which may disadvantage some patients due to the "digital divide." Our objective was to determine patient and neighborhood characteristics associated with visit modality. {STUDY} {DESIGN}: This was a cross-sectional study across 1652 primary care and specialty care practices of adult patients at an integrated health system from April 23 to June 1, 2020. {METHODS}: We used electronic health record and administrative data. Our primary outcome was visit modality (in-person, video, or telephone), which was captured using billing codes. We assessed predictors of using video vs telephone using multivariable logistic regression. We used hierarchical logistic regression to determine the contribution of patient-, physician-, and practice-level components of variance in the choice of video or telephone visits. {RESULTS}: We analyzed 231,596 visits by 162,102 patients. Sixty-five percent of the visits were virtual (31.7\% telephone, 33.5\% video). Patients who were older than 65 years (adjusted odds ratio [{AOR}], 0.41; 95\% {CI}, 0.40-0.43), Black ({AOR}, 0.60; 95\% {CI}, 0.57-0.63), Hispanic ({AOR}, 0.76; 95\% {CI}, 0.73-0.80), Spanish-speaking ({AOR}, 0.57; 95\% {CI}, 0.52-0.61), and from areas with low broadband access ({AOR}, 0.93; 95\% {CI}, 0.88-0.98) were less likely to use video visits. Practices (38\%) and clinicians (26\%) drove more of the variation in video visit use than patients (9\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: Telemedicine access differences may compound disparities in chronic disease and {COVID}-19 outcomes. Institutions should monitor video visit use across demographics and equip patients, clinicians, and practices to promote telemedicine equity.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: On the basis of the 2014 guidelines for hypertension therapy in the United States, many eligible adults remain untreated. We projected the cost-effectiveness of treating hypertension in U.S. adults according to the 2014 guidelines. {METHODS}: We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to simulate drug-treatment and monitoring costs, costs averted for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, and quality-adjusted life-years ({QALYs}) gained by treating previously untreated adults between the ages of 35 and 74 years from 2014 through 2024. We assessed cost-effectiveness according to age, hypertension level, and the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease or diabetes. {RESULTS}: The full implementation of the new hypertension guidelines would result in approximately 56,000 fewer cardiovascular events and 13,000 fewer deaths from cardiovascular causes annually, which would result in overall cost savings. The projections showed that the treatment of patients with existing cardiovascular disease or stage 2 hypertension would save lives and costs for men between the ages of 35 and 74 years and for women between the ages of 45 and 74 years. The treatment of men or women with existing cardiovascular disease or men with stage 2 hypertension but without cardiovascular disease would remain cost-saving even if strategies to increase medication adherence doubled treatment costs. The treatment of stage 1 hypertension was cost-effective (defined as {\textless}\$50,000 per {QALY}) for all men and for women between the ages of 45 and 74 years, whereas treating women between the ages of 35 and 44 years with stage 1 hypertension but without cardiovascular disease had intermediate or low cost-effectiveness. {CONCLUSIONS}: The implementation of the 2014 hypertension guidelines for U.S. adults between the ages of 35 and 74 years could potentially prevent about 56,000 cardiovascular events and 13,000 deaths annually, while saving costs. Controlling hypertension in all patients with cardiovascular disease or stage 2 hypertension could be effective and cost-saving.

In the Symplicity {HTN}-2 randomized controlled trial, catheter-based renal denervation ({RDN}) lowered systolic blood pressure by 32 +/- 23 mm Hg from 178 +/- 18 mm Hg at baseline. {METHODS}: A state-transition model was used to predict the effect of {RDN} and standard of care on 10-year and lifetime probabilities of stroke, myocardial infarction, all coronary heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and median survival. We adopted a societal perspective and estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in U.S. dollars per quality-adjusted life-year, both discounted at 3\% per year. Robustness and uncertainty were evaluated using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. {RESULTS}: Renal denervation substantially reduced event probabilities (10-year/lifetime relative risks: stroke 0.70/0.83; myocardial infarction 0.68/0.85; all coronary heart disease 0.78/0.90; heart failure 0.79/0.92; end-stage renal disease 0.72/0.81). Median survival was 18.4 years for {RDN} versus 17.1 years for standard of care. The discounted lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was \$3,071 per quality-adjusted life-year. Findings were relatively insensitive to variations in input parameters except for systolic blood pressure reduction, baseline systolic blood pressure, and effect duration. The 95\% credible interval for incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was cost-saving to \$31,460 per quality-adjusted life-year. {CONCLUSIONS}: The model suggests that catheter-based renal denervation, over a wide range of assumptions, is a cost-effective strategy for resistant hypertension that might result in lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

Data about changes in hypertension control are important to set intervention priorities. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies to determine the control of hypertension in Spain over the past decade. {METHODS}: A search of {PubMed}/{MEDLINE}, {SCOPUS} and {IME} was performed for epidemiological studies conducted in Spain (since 2000) with data on control rates for hypertension. The primary outcome was the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension defined as the percentage of patients having {SBP} at least 140 {mmHg} and/or {DBP} at least 90 {mmHg}. For populations at risk (e.g. patients with diabetes), the definition was {SBP} at least 130 {mmHg} and/or {DBP} at least 80-85 {mmHg}. {RESULTS}: Seventy-six studies evaluating 341 632 patients (79\% with hypertension) met the inclusion criteria. Among hypertensive patients, the overall pooled prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension ({\textgreater}/=140/90 {mmHg}) was 67.0\% [95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 64.1-69.9\%], but was 87.6\% (95\% {CI} 86.2-89.0\%) when the most restricted definition ({\textgreater}/=130/80-85 {mmHg}) was used for patients at risk. The test for heterogeneity was significant (P {\textless} 0.001). Using metaregression analyses, we showed that the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension did not change significantly over time, but the percentage of patients receiving at least two antihypertensive drugs increased (P = 0.032 and 0.001). {CONCLUSION}: In Spain, the control of hypertension is far from optimum and does not appear to have improved in recent years despite the increased intensity of therapy.

	abstract = {Medicine has traditionally focused on relieving patient symptoms. However, in developed countries, maintaining good health increasingly involves management of such problems as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, which often have no symptoms. Moreover, abnormal blood pressure, lipid, and glucose values are generally sufficient to warrant treatment without further diagnostic maneuvers. Limitations in managing such problems are often due to clinical inertia-failure of health care providers to initiate or intensify therapy when indicated. Clinical inertia is due to at least three problems: overestimation of care provided; use of "soft" reasons to avoid intensification of therapy; and lack of education, training, and practice organization aimed at achieving therapeutic goals. Strategies to overcome clinical inertia must focus on medical students, residents, and practicing physicians. Revised education programs should lead to assimilation of three concepts: the benefits of treating to therapeutic targets, the practical complexity of treating to target for different disorders, and the need to structure routine practice to facilitate effective management of disorders for which resolution of patient symptoms is not sufficient to guide care. Physicians will need to build into their practice a system of reminders and performance feedback to ensure necessary care.},

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with {COVID}-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed {COVID}-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral {RNA} detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Findings 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48\%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30\%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19\%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8\%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95\% {CI} 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ({SOFA}) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p{\textless}0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/{mL} (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days ({IQR} 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but {SARS}-{CoV}-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. Interpretation The potential risk factors of older age, high {SOFA} score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/{mL} could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

	abstract = {Background: Impressive decreases in cardiovascular mortality have been achieved through risk factor reduction and clinical intervention, yet cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death nationally. Objective: To estimate up-to-date preventable fractions of cardiovascular mortality associated with elimination and reduction of 5 leading risk factors nationally and by state in the United States. Design: Cross-sectional and cohort studies. Setting: Nationally representative and state-representative samples of the U.S. population. Participants: Adults aged 45 to 79 years. Measurements: Self-reported risk factor status in the {BRFSS} (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) 2009-2010 was corrected to approximate clinical definitions. The relative hazards of cardiovascular death (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes I00 to I99) associated with risk factors were estimated using data from {NHANES} (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) (1988-1994 and 1999-2004, followed through 2006). Results: The preventable fraction of cardiovascular mortality associated with complete elimination of elevated cholesterol levels, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and smoking was 54.0\% for men and 49.6\% for women in 2009 to 2010. When the more feasible target of reducing risk factors to the best achieved levels in U.S. states was considered, diabetes (1.7\% and 4.1\%), hypertension (3.8\% and 7.3\%), and smoking (5.1\% and 4.4\%) were independently associated with the largest preventable fractions among men and women, respectively. With both targets, southern states had the largest preventable fractions, and western states had the smallest. Limitation: Self-reported state data; mortality hazards relied on baseline risk factor status. Conclusion: Major modifiable cardiovascular risk factors collectively accounted for half of cardiovascular deaths in U.S. adults aged 45 to 79 years in 2009 to 2010. Fewer than 10\% of cardiovascular deaths nationally could be prevented if all states were to achieve risk factor levels observed in the best-performing states.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: We aimed to investigate whether the benefits of blood pressure-lowering drugs are proportional to baseline cardiovascular risk, to establish whether absolute risk could be used to inform treatment decisions for blood pressure-lowering therapy, as is recommended for lipid-lowering therapy. {METHODS}: This meta-analysis included individual participant data from trials that randomly assigned patients to either blood pressure-lowering drugs or placebo, or to more intensive or less intensive blood pressure-lowering regimens. The primary outcome was total major cardiovascular events, consisting of stroke, heart attack, heart failure, or cardiovascular death. Participants were separated into four categories of baseline 5-year major cardiovascular risk using a risk prediction equation developed from the placebo groups of the included trials ({\textless}11\%, 11-15\%, 15-21\%, {\textgreater}21\%). {FINDINGS}: 11 trials and 26 randomised groups met the inclusion criteria, and included 67,475 individuals, of whom 51,917 had available data for the calculation of the risk equations. 4167 (8\%) had a cardiovascular event during a median of 4.0 years ({IQR} 3.4-4.4) of follow-up. The mean estimated baseline levels of 5-year cardiovascular risk for each of the four risk groups were 6.0\% ({SD} 2.0), 12.1\% (1.5), 17.7\% (1.7), and 26.8\% (5.4). In each consecutive higher risk group, blood pressure-lowering treatment reduced the risk of cardiovascular events relatively by 18\% (95\% {CI} 7-27), 15\% (4-25), 13\% (2-22), and 15\% (5-24), respectively (p=0.30 for trend). However, in absolute terms, treating 1000 patients in each group with blood pressure-lowering treatment for 5 years would prevent 14 (95\% {CI} 8-21), 20 (8-31), 24 (8-40), and 38 (16-61) cardiovascular events, respectively (p=0.04 for trend). {INTERPRETATION}: Lowering blood pressure provides similar relative protection at all levels of baseline cardiovascular risk, but progressively greater absolute risk reductions as baseline risk increases. These results support the use of predicted baseline cardiovascular disease risk equations to inform blood pressure-lowering treatment decisions. {FUNDING}: None.},

A total of 22 576 patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease were divided into 4 groups according to the proportion of visits in which {BP} was in control ({\textless}140/90 mm Hg): {\textless}25\%, 25\% to {\textless}50\%, 50\% to {\textless}75\%, and {\textgreater}or=75\%. Risk of primary outcome (first occurrence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke), myocardial infarction, and stroke decreased progressively from the group with {\textless}25\% to the group with {\textgreater}or=75\% of visits with {BP} control. Adjusted risks of primary outcome (heart rate: 0.60; 95\% {CI}: 0.53 to 0.67), myocardial infarction (heart rate: 0.58; 95\% {CI}: 0.48 to 0.70), and stroke (heart rate: 0.50; 95\% {CI}: 0.37 to 0.67) were less in the group with {\textgreater}or=75\% of visits with {BP} control compared with the group with {\textless}25\% of visits with {BP} control. Baseline {BP} was not predictive of outcomes. Proportion of visits with {BP} control was associated with mean follow-up systolic {BP} (r(2)=0.64), both being independently related to primary outcome. As proportion of visits with {BP} control increases, there is an associated steep reduction in cardiovascular risk, independent of baseline characteristics and mean on-treatment {BP}. Consistency of {BP} control during treatment provides additional information on the protective effect of antihypertensive treatment.

	abstract = {America's health care system has become too complex and costly to continue business as usual. Best Care at Lower Cost explains that inefficiencies, an overwhelming amount of data, and other economic and quality barriers hinder progress in improving health and threaten the nation's economic stability and global competitiveness. According to this report, the knowledge and tools exist to put the health system on the right course to achieve continuous improvement and better quality care at a lower cost. {\textbackslash}{nThe} costs of the system's current inefficiency underscore the urgent need for a systemwide transformation. About 30 percent of health spending in 2009--roughly \$750 billion--was wasted on unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud, and other problems. Moreover, inefficiencies cause needless suffering. By one estimate, roughly 75,000 deaths might have been averted in 2005 if every state had delivered care at the quality level of the best performing state. This report states that the way health care providers currently train, practice, and learn new information cannot keep pace with the flood of research discoveries and technological advances.{\textbackslash}{nAbout} 75 million Americans have more than one chronic condition, requiring coordination among multiple specialists and therapies, which can increase the potential for miscommunication, misdiagnosis, potentially conflicting interventions, and dangerous drug interactions. Best Care at Lower Cost emphasizes that a better use of data is a critical element of a continuously improving health system, such as mobile technologies and electronic health records that offer significant potential to capture and share health data better. In order for this to occur, the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, {IT} developers, and standard-setting organizations should ensure that these systems are robust and interoperable. Clinicians and care organizations should fully adopt these technologies, and patients should be encouraged to use tools, such as personal health information portals, to actively engage in their care.{\textbackslash}{nThis} book is a call to action that will guide health care providers; administrators; caregivers; policy makers; health professionals; federal, state, and local government agencies; private and public health organizations; and educational institutions.},

We measured 48-hour ambulatory {BP} at baseline and 3 months after any adjustment in treatment or, at the least, annually. After a median follow-up of 5.4 years, patients who took at least one {BP}-lowering medication at bedtime had an adjusted risk for total cardiovascular events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, revascularization, heart failure, arterial occlusion of lower extremities, occlusion of the retinal artery, and stroke) that was approximately one-third that of patients who took all medications upon awakening (adjusted {HR} 0.31; 95\% {CI} 0.21 to 0.46; P {\textless} 0.001).

Furthermore, patients on bedtime treatment had a significantly lower mean sleep-time {BP} and a greater proportion demonstrated control of their ambulatory {BP} (56\% versus 45\%, P = 0.003). Each 5-{mmHg} decrease in mean sleep-time systolic {BP} was associated with a 14\% reduction in the risk for cardiovascular events during follow-up (P {\textless} 0.001).

Exposure to {TD} ({OR} 1.54, 95\% {CI} 1.41 to 1.68) or {BB} ({OR} 1.19, 95\% {CI} 1.11 to 1.28) was associated with an increased {DM} risk, while {CCB} and {RASB} exposure was not. {TD}+{BB} combination resulted in the fully combined diabetogenic risk of both agents ({OR} 1.99, 95\% {CI} 1.80 to 2.20; interaction {OR} 1.09, 95\% {CI} 0.97 to 1.22). In contrast, combination of {RASB} with either {TD} or {BB} showed significant negative interactions, resulting in a smaller {DM} risk than {TD} or {BB} monotherapy. {CONCLUSIONS}: Diabetogenic potential of combination therapy should be considered when prescribing antihypertensive therapy.},

	abstract = {Conventional office blood pressure readings are a well-established surrogate for the prediction of cardiovascular risk. It is assumed that these readings reflect an underlying average level of blood pressure exposure occurring in an individual over a period of time. But because blood pressure is not static, important additional prognostic information about the diurnal blood pressure profile, including within-day and between-day variability, is not easily ascertained from conventional measurements. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides a more thorough depiction of the underlying blood pressure level and predicts cardiovascular risk more robustly than do conventional blood pressure measurements. Although the technology has been available for more than 30 years, there has been an expansion of the research base in the past decade supporting its role in the evaluation and management of patients with hypertension and as an important surrogate in research trials. This review summarizes recent evidence supporting the predictive ability of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and briefly highlights opportunities for clinical pharmacists to adopt this important clinical and research tool.},

Every full text article published in (1) Journal of American Medical Informatics Association, (2) Journal of Biomedical Informatics, (3) Proceedings of the Annual American Medical Informatics Association Symposium, and (4) Proceedings of Clinical Research Informatics Conference within the past 3 years was assessed for inclusion in the review. Only articles using automated techniques were included. {RESULTS}: Ninety-seven articles met our inclusion criteria. Forty-six used natural language processing ({NLP})-based techniques, 24 described rule-based systems, 41 used statistical analyses, data mining, or machine learning techniques, while 22 described hybrid systems. Nine articles described the architecture of large-scale systems developed for determining cohort eligibility of patients. {DISCUSSION}: We observe that there is a rise in the number of studies associated with cohort identification using electronic medical records. Statistical analyses or machine learning, followed by {NLP} techniques, are gaining popularity over the years in comparison with rule-based systems. {CONCLUSIONS}: There are a variety of approaches for classifying patients into a particular phenotype. Different techniques and data sources are used, and good performance is reported on datasets at respective institutions. However, no system makes comprehensive use of electronic medical records addressing all of their known weaknesses.},

Medical records of 2416 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension who were prescribed initial antihypertensive monotherapy by general practitioners in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom were evaluated. Comparisons were made among the angiotensin {II} receptor antagonist ({AIIRA}) irbesartan, all other antihypertensive classes (including {AIIRAs} other than irbesartan), and the {AIIRA} losartan. Patients initiated on the {AIIRA} irbesartan scored highest with a persistence rate of 60.8\%, followed by patients who received all other {AIIRA} agents with a persistence rate of 51.3\%. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and losartan were associated with comparable persistence rates, between 42.0\% and 49.7\%. Patients who received diuretics scored lowest with a persistence rate of 34.4\%. Persistence has emerged as an essential factor for blood pressure control.

However, loop diuretics are often stopped while potassium may be unnecessarily continued (i.e., relic). We aimed to quantify the occurrence of relics using older adults previously experiencing a loop diuretic-potassium prescribing cascade as an example. Methods We conducted a prescription sequence symmetry analysis using the population-based Medicare Fee-For-Service data (2011–2018) and partitioned the 150 days following potassium initiation by day to assess the daily treatment scenarios (i.e., loop diuretics alone, potassium alone, combination of loop diuretics and potassium, or neither). We calculated the proportion of patients developing the relic, proportion of person-days under potassium alone, the daily probability of the relic, and the proportion of patients filling potassium after loop diuretic discontinuation. We also identified the risk factors of the relic. Results We identified 284,369 loop diuretic initiators who were 8 times more likely to receive potassium supplementation simultaneously or after (i.e., the prescribing cascade), rather than before, loop diuretic initiation ({aSR} 8.0, 95\% {CI} 7.9–8.2). Among the 66,451 loop diuretic initiators who subsequently (≤30 days) initiated potassium, 20,445 (30.8\%) patients remained on potassium after loop diuretic discontinuation, and 9365 (14.1\%) patients subsequently filled another potassium supplementation. Following loop diuretic initiation, 4.0\% of person-days were for potassium alone, and daily probability of the relic was the highest after day 90 of loop diuretic initiation (5.6\%). Older age, female sex, higher diuretic daily dose, and greater baseline comorbidities were risk factors for the relic, while patients having the same prescriber or pharmacy involved in the use of both medications were less likely to experience the relic.

In seven {GLP}-1RA trials, we observed a similar {MACE} benefit between Asian and White populations (P = 0.10). In our networkmeta-analysis we found a comparable benefit for {MACE} between {SGLT}2 inhibitors and {GLP}-1RAs in Asian patients.The data were from stratified analyses.There appear to be comparable cardiorenal benefits of {SGLT}2 inhibitors and {GLP}-1RAs between Asian and White participants enrolled in {CV} and renal outcome trials; the two therapies seem to have similar {CV} benefits for Asian participants.},

	abstract = {{SARS}-{CoV}-2 accesses host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, which is also affected by commonly used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ({ACEIs}) and angiotensin receptor blockers ({ARBs}), raising concerns that {ACEI} or {ARB} exposure may portend differential {COVID}-19 outcomes. In parallel cohort studies of outpatient and inpatient {COVID}-19-diagnosed adults with hypertension, we assessed associations between antihypertensive exposure ({ACEI}/{ARB} vs. non-{ACEI}/{ARB} antihypertensives, as well as between {ACEI}- vs. {ARB}) at the time of {COVID}-19 diagnosis, using electronic health record data from {PCORnet} health systems. The primary outcomes were all-cause hospitalization or death (outpatient cohort) or all-cause death (inpatient), analyzed via Cox regression weighted by inverse probability of treatment weights. From February 2020 through December 9, 2020, 11,246 patients (3477 person-years) and 2200 patients (777 person-years) were included from 17 health systems in outpatient and inpatient cohorts, respectively. There were 1015 all-cause hospitalization or deaths in the outpatient cohort (incidence, 29.2 events per 100 person-years), with no significant difference by {ACEI}/{ARB} use (adjusted {HR} 1.01; 95\% {CI} 0.88, 1.15). In the inpatient cohort, there were 218 all-cause deaths (incidence, 28.1 per 100 person-years) and {ACEI}/{ARB} exposure was associated with reduced death (adjusted {HR}, 0.76; 95\% {CI}, 0.57, 0.99). {ACEI}, versus {ARB} exposure, was associated with higher risk of hospitalization in the outpatient cohort, but no difference in all-cause death in either cohort. There was no evidence of effect modification across pre-specified baseline characteristics. Our results suggest {ACEI} and {ARB} exposure have no detrimental effect on hospitalizations and may reduce death among hypertensive patients diagnosed with {COVID}-19.},

Background and objectives In 2011, the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services implemented bundling of all services for patients receiving dialysis, including erythropoietin-stimulating agents use, and the Food and Drug Administration recommended conservative erythropoietin-stimulating agent dosing.
Design, setting, participants, \& measurements This retrospective cohort study investigated anemia care and clinical outcomes before and after the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services bundled payment and the revised Food and Drug Administration–recommended erythropoietin-stimulating agent labeling for Medicare-insured adults receiving hemodialysis using data from the United States Renal Data System from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2016. Clinical outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular event (stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality), cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure. Measurements were compared between prepolicy (2006–2010) and postpolicy (2012–2016) implementation using interrupted time series and Cox proportional hazards regression models.
Results Of 481,564 patients, erythropoietin-stimulating agent use immediately decreased by 84.8 per 1000 persons (P{\textless}0.001), with a significant decrease in the slope of the trend line (both P=0.001). Blood transfusion use rapidly increased by 8.34 per 1000 persons in April 2012 and then gradually decreased (both P=0.001). The percentage of patients with hemoglobin {\textgreater}11 g/dl decreased from 68\% in January 2006 to 28\% in December 2016, whereas those with hemoglobin {\textless}9 g/dl increased from 5\% to 9\%. Overall major adverse cardiovascular event (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.95; 95\% confidence interval, 0.94 to 0.96), stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95\% confidence interval, 0.80 to 0.86), all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.89), cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.81; 95\% confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.83), and heart failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.86; 95\% confidence interval, 0.84 to 0.88) risks were lower. Acute myocardial infarction risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.06) was higher after policies changed.
Conclusions The Medicare reimbursement policy and Food and Drug Administration–recommended erythropoietin-stimulating agent dosing changes were associated with lower erythropoietin-stimulating agent use and lower hemoglobin levels. These changes in anemia care were associated with lower risks of major adverse cardiovascular event, stroke, mortality, and heart failure but higher risk of acute myocardial infarction among adults receiving hemodialysis.},

Design Retrospective cohort study. Data Source {IBM} {MarketScan}® commercial claims database and Medicare Supplemental claims database from 2007 to 2019. Patients Patients aged 18 years or older with stable treated hypertension and depression who newly initiate either serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or {SSRIs}. Intervention Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors versus {SSRIs}. Measurements and Main Results The primary outcomes were: (1) {TI} (first occurrence of antihypertensive regimen augmentation or dose escalation); (2) {MACE} (first occurrence of stroke or acute myocardial infarction). Baseline risk between the two groups was balanced via 1:1 propensity score ({PS}) matching. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratio ({aHR}) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% {CI}). After 1:1 {PS} matching, we included 19,160 patients in the study cohort (mean age: 52 years, 62\% females) of which 9580 initiated serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and 9580 initiated {SSRIs}. Patients who initiated serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors had 15 {MACE} events (incidence rate per 1000 person-years [{IR}], 3.9) and 1675 {TI} events ({IR}, 540.2), compared with 17 {MACE} events ({IR}, 4.0) and 1774 {TI} events ({IR}, 518.5) in the {SSRI} group. The risk of {TI} ({aHR}: 1.01, [95\% {CI}: 0.94, 1.08]) and {MACE} ({aHR}: 0.98, [95\% {CI}: 0.49, 1.96]) did not differ among patients initiated serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors versus {SSRIs}. Conclusions Among patients with stable hypertension and depression, initiation of serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors had a similar risk of antihypertensive {TI} and {MACE} compared to initiation of {SSRIs}.

The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude and characteristics of a beta-blocker–edema–loop diuretic prescribing cascade.A prescription sequence symmetry analysis was used to assess loop diuretic initiation before and after initiation of beta-blockers among patients 20 years or older without heart failure, atrial fibrillation, other arrythmias, or use of calcium channel blocker within a U.S. private insurance claims database (2005–2018). The temporality of loop diuretic initiation relative to a beta-blocker or negative control (renin-angiotensin system blocker) initiation was tabulated. Secular trend-adjusted sequence ratios ({aSRs}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}) compared the initiation of loop diuretic 90 days before and after initiation of beta-blockers.Among 988,675 beta-blocker initiators, 9,489 patients initiated a new loop diuretic prescription 90 days after and 5,245 patients before beta-blocker initiation, resulting in an {aSR} of 1.78 (95\% {CI}, 1.72–1.84). An estimated 1.72 beta-blocker initiators per 100 patient-years experienced the prescribing cascade in the first 90 days. The {aSR} was disproportionately higher among older adults ({aSR} 1.97), men ({aSR} 2.25), and patients who initiated metoprolol tartrate ({aSR} 2.48), labetalol ({aSR} 2.18), or metoprolol succinate ({aSR} 2.11). Negative control results ({aSR} 1.09, 95\% {CI}, 1.05–1.13) generally corroborated our findings, but suggested modest within-person time-varying confounding.We observed excess use of loop diuretics following beta-blocker initiation that was only partially explained by secular trends or hypertension progression.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:

Limited evidence exists regarding long-term effectiveness and safety of aldosterone antagonists ({AAs}) versus beta blockers ({BBs}) as fourth-line antihypertensive agents in patients with resistant hypertension ({RH}). We evaluated the comparative effectiveness and safety of aldosterone {AA} versus {BB}.

{METHODS}:

We conducted a real-world retrospective cohort study using {IBM} {MarketScan} commercial claims and Medicare Supplemental claims (2007–2019). Patients with {RH} entered the cohort (ie, index date) when they newly initiated either {AA} or {BB}. The effectiveness outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events. Safety outcomes were hyperkalemia, gynecomastia, and kidney function deterioration. Potential confounding was addressed by adjustment for baseline characteristics via stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting ({SIPTW}) based on propensity scores. Cox proportional hazards regression with {SIPTWs} were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratio ({aHR}) and 95\% {CI} comparing risk for outcomes between {AA} and {BB} groups.

{RESULTS}:

We identified 80 598 patients with {RH} (mean age: 61 years, 51\% males), of which 6626 initiated {AA} and 73 972 initiated {BB} as the fourth antihypertensive agent. Among patients with {RH}, initiation of {AA} as a fourth-line antihypertensive agent did not significantly reduce major adverse cardiovascular event risk relative to {BB} initiation ({aHR}, 0.77 [95\% {CI}, 0.50–1.19]) but did substantially increase the risk of hyperkalemia ({aHR}, 3.86 [95\% {CI}, 2.78–5.34]), gynecomastia ({aHR}, 9.51 [95\% {CI}, 5.69–15.89]), and kidney function deterioration ({aHR}, 1.63 [95\% {CI}, 1.34–1.99]).

{CONCLUSIONS}:

Long-term clinical trials powered to assess major adverse cardiovascular events are necessary to understand the risk-benefit trade-off of {AA} as fourth-line therapy for {RH}.},

	abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates that higher blood pressure ({BP}) variability from one physician office visit to the next (hereafter referred to as visit-to-visit {BP} variability) is associated with poor outcomes. Short-term measurement (throughout 1 year) of visit-to-visit {BP} variability in high-risk older patients may help identify patients at increased risk of death.To evaluate whether short-term visit-to-visit {BP} variability is associated with increased long-term mortality risk.The {US} cohort of the International Verapamil {SR}-Trandolapril Study ({INVEST}), a randomized clinical trial of 16 688 patients aged 50 years or older with hypertension and coronary artery disease, was conducted between September 2, 1997, and December 15, 2000, with in-trial follow-up through February 14, 2003. The study evaluated a calcium antagonist (sustained-release verapamil plus trandolapril) vs β-blocker (atenolol plus hydrochlorothiazide) treatment strategy. Blood pressure measurement visits were scheduled every 6 weeks for the first 6 months and biannually thereafter. Statistical analysis was performed from September 2, 1997, to May 1, 2014.Visit-to-visit systolic {BP} ({SBP}) and diastolic {BP} variability during the first year of enrollment using 4 different {BP} variability measures: standard deviation, coefficient of variation, average real variability, and variability independent of the mean.All-cause death, assessed via the {US} National Death Index, beginning after the exposure assessment period through May 1, 2014.For the present post hoc analysis, long-term mortality data were available on 16 688 patients (9001 women [54\%]; mean [{SD}] age, 66.5 [9.9] years; 45\% White patients, 16\% Black patients, and 37\% Hispanic patients). During a mean ({SD}) follow-up of 10.9 (4.2) years, 5058 patients (30\%) died. All 4 variability measures for {SBP} were significantly associated with long-term mortality after adjustment for baseline demographic characteristics and comorbidities. After comparison of lowest vs highest variability measure quintiles, the magnitude of the association with death remained statistically significant even after adjustment for baseline demographic characteristics and comorbidities (average real variability: adjusted hazard ratio [{aHR}], 1.18; 95\% {CI}, 1.08-1.30; standard deviation: {aHR}, 1.14; 95\% {CI}, 1.04-1.24; coefficient of variation: {aHR}, 1.15; 95\% {CI}, 1.06-1.26; variability independent of the mean: {aHR}, 1.15; 95\% {CI}, 1.05-1.25). The signal was stronger in women compared with men. Associations of diastolic {BP} variability measures with death were weaker than for {SBP} and were not significant after adjustment.This study suggests that, in a large population of older patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease, short-term visit-to-visit {SBP} variability was associated with excess long-term mortality, especially for women. Efforts to identify and minimize visit-to-visit {SBP} variability may be important in reducing excess mortality later in life.{ClinicalTrials}.gov Identifier: {NCT}00133692},

Methods and findings In this retrospective cohort study of Veterans with treated hypertension in the Veterans Health Administration (01/19/2020-08/28/2020), we compared users of (A) {ARB}/{ACEI} vs. non-{ARB}/{ACEI} (excluding Veterans with compelling indications to reduce confounding by indication) and (B) {ARB} vs. {ACEI} among (1) {SARS}-{CoV}-2+ outpatients and (2) {COVID}-19 hospitalized inpatients. The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalization or mortality (outpatients) and all-cause mortality (inpatients). We estimated hazard ratios ({HR}) using propensity score-weighted Cox regression. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between exposure groups after weighting. Among outpatients, there were 5.0 and 6.0 primary outcomes per 100 person-months for {ARB}/{ACEI} (n = 2,482) vs. non-{ARB}/{ACEI} (n = 2,487) users ({HR} 0.85, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.73–0.99, median follow-up 87 days). Among outpatients who were {ARB} (n = 4,877) vs. {ACEI} (n = 8,704) users, there were 13.2 and 14.8 primary outcomes per 100 person-months ({HR} 0.91, 95\%{CI} 0.86–0.97, median follow-up 85 days). Among inpatients who were {ARB}/{ACEI} (n = 210) vs. non-{ARB}/{ACEI} (n = 275) users, there were 3.4 and 2.0 all-cause deaths per 100 person months ({HR} 1.25, 95\%{CI} 0.30–5.13, median follow-up 30 days). Among inpatients, {ARB} (n = 1,164) and {ACEI} (n = 2,014) users had 21.0 vs. 17.7 all-cause deaths, per 100 person-months ({HR} 1.13, 95\%{CI} 0.93–1.38, median follow-up 30 days). Conclusions This observational analysis supports continued {ARB} or {ACEI} use for patients already using these medications before {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. The novel beneficial association observed among outpatients between users of {ARBs} vs. {ACEIs} on hospitalization or mortality should be confirmed with randomized trials.},

Although no clinical trials have been published in the peer-reviewed literature, results from two phase 3 clinical trials reported to {ClinicalTrials}.gov suggest that amlodipine–celecoxib has similar short-term efficacy compared with amlodipine alone in reducing blood pressure and a comparable adverse event profile to the individual components administered alone.Expert opinion: Despite the pill burden reduction and a body of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of the individual drugs, the role of amlodipine–celecoxib in the management of patients with hypertension–osteoarthritis remains in question. This is in no small part because the combination product is very costly relative to the generic components, provides limited flexibility for dose-adjustment, and lacks long-term data on safety and efficacy.},

Design Retrospective cohort study. Data Source {IBM}® {MarketScan}® research databases (2014–2018). Patients Patients aged 18 years or older with their first {HFrEF} hospitalization on or after January 1, 2015, who initiated sacubitril/valsartan or angiotensin receptor antagonist after hospital discharge. Intervention Sacubitril/Valsartan versus Angiotensin receptor antagonist. Measurements and Main Results The index date was the first sacubitril/valsartan or angiotensin receptor antagonist fill date. After 1 up to 3 propensity score matching, Cox proportional hazards regression was used with robust variance estimators to compare {HF}-related and all-cause hospitalizations between treatments. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the main analysis. After propensity score matching, 1,088 sacubitril/valsartan and 2,839 angiotensin receptor antagonist new users were included. The crude incidence of {HF}-related hospitalization was 13 per 100 person-years for sacubitril/valsartan users and 18 per 100 person-years for angiotensin receptor antagonist users. Compared with angiotensin receptor antagonist use, sacubitril/valsartan use was associated with 27\% lower risk of {HF}-related hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.73; 95\% confidence interval, 0.58–0.91; p = 0.006) and 31\% lower risk of all-cause hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.69; 95\% confidence interval, 0.61–0.79; p {\textless} 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant heterogeneity, including subpopulations with chronic kidney disease or coronary artery disease. Conclusions Compared with angiotensin receptor antagonists, sacubitril/valsartan was associated with lower risk of {HF}-related and all-cause hospitalizations. Our data suggest that, when added sequentially, sacubitril/valsartan should be the preferred initial agent over angiotensin receptor antagonists.},

We aimed to identify the metabolic signatures of baseline {PRA} and the linkages with {BP} response to β-blockers and thiazides. Using data from the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses-2 ({PEAR}-2) trial, multivariable linear regression adjusting for age, sex and baseline systolic-{BP} ({SBP}) was performed on European–American individuals treated with metoprolol (n = 198) and chlorthalidone (n = 181), to test associations between 856 metabolites and baseline {PRA}. Metabolites with a false discovery rate ({FDR}) {\textless} 0.05 or p {\textless} 0.01 were tested for replication in 463 European–American individuals treated with atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide. Replicated metabolites were then tested for validation based on the directionality of association with {BP} response. Sixty-three metabolites were associated with baseline {PRA}, of which nine, including six lipids, were replicated. Of those replicated, two metabolites associated with higher baseline {PRA} were validated: caprate was associated with greater metoprolol {SBP} response (β = −1.7 ± 0.6, p = 0.006) and sphingosine-1-phosphate was associated with reduced hydrochlorothiazide {SBP} response (β = 7.6 ± 2.8, p = 0.007). These metabolites are clustered with metabolites involved in sphingolipid, phospholipid, and purine metabolic pathways.

	abstract = {Background
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ({ABPM}) has been increasingly recommended for diagnosis confirmation and monitoring in patients with new-onset hypertension and apparent treatment-resistant hypertension ({aTRH}). We assessed insurance claims submitted for {ABPM} among a nationally representative sample of commercially insured U.S. patients.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis using the {IBM} {MarketScan}® commercial claims database from January 2008–December 2017, including 2 populations: those with incident treated hypertension ({ITH}; first antihypertensive filled) or {aTRH} (first overlapping use of 4 antihypertensive agents). We identified {ABPM} claims filed within 6 months before to 6 months after the qualifying antihypertensive fill and determined prevalence of {ABPM} use overall and by year in each population.
Results
In total, 2,820,303 patients met {ITH} criteria and 298,049 met {aTRH} criteria. Of those with {ITH}, 7650 (2.7 per 1000 persons) had ≥1 {ABPM} claim submitted, and annual {ABPM} prevalence ranged from 2.0 to 3.7 per 1000 persons, increasing over time (Ptrend{\textless}0.0001). Among those with {aTRH}, 630 (2.1 per 1000 persons) had ≥1 {ABPM} claim submitted, and annual {ABPM} prevalence ranged from 1.6 to 2.7 per 1000 persons, decreasing over time (Ptrend = 0.054). Timing of {ABPM} claims suggested they were used primarily for diagnosis confirmation in {ITH}, and more evenly distributed between diagnosis confirmation and monitoring in {aTRH}.
Conclusions
Despite guideline recommendations for more widescale use, {ABPM} appears to be used rarely in the U.S., with fewer than 0.5\% of commercially insured patients with newly treated hypertension or {aTRH} having {ABPM} claims submitted to their insurance.},

There is limited evidence to support the use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants ({DOACs}) in patients with venous thromboembolism ({VTE}) and active cancer. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of {DOACs} versus warfarin for the prevention of recurrent {VTE} and major bleeding events in patients with {VTE} and active cancer.
Methods
We identified patients with incident {VTE} and active cancer who newly initiated treatment with {DOACs} or warfarin from Truven Health {MarketScan} Commercial Claims and Medicare supplemental databases. Patients were followed up from treatment initiation (index date) until the occurrence of {\textgreater}7-day gap in treatment, the start of the study comparator, an outcome of interest (recurrent {VTE} or major bleeding), inpatient death, disenrollment, or end of the study period, whichever occurred first. We controlled for confounders via propensity score matching and estimated the hazard ratios ({HRs}) using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
Findings
A total of 9952 patients were included in the matched cohort (4976 {DOACs} users and 4976 warfarin users). Patient characteristics were well balanced after matching. We observed a lower incidence of recurrent {VTE} (3 vs 5 per 100 person-years) and major bleeding events (2 vs 3 per 100 person-years) in the {DOAC} group compared to warfarin group, respectively. In Cox regression models, use of {DOACs} (vs warfarin) was associated with a lower risk of recurrent {VTE} (hazard ratio ({HR}), 0.59; 95\% {CI}, 0.42–0.82) and major bleeding events ({HR}, 0.64; 95\% {CI}, 0.44–0.94).
Implications
On the basis of our findings, among patients with {VTE} and active cancer, {DOACs} offer superior effectiveness with a lower risk of bleeding when compared with warfarin for the secondary prevention of {VTE}.},

The date of first {ABPM} claim (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes 93784, 93786, 93788, or 93790) was considered the index date. Patients with 12 months of continuous enrollment preindex and 30-day postindex were included. Per beneficiary {OPP} was calculated by aggregating all {ABPM}-related {OPPs} within the 30-day postindex window ({ABPM} episode).Of 22,317 beneficiaries receiving {ABPM}, 62\% had \$0 {OPP} and 38\% had {OPP} \&gt;\$0. Among the latter, median {OPP} per beneficiary for an {ABPM} episode was \$23 (interquartile range [{IQR}], \$14, \$32), driven primarily by full {ABPM} claims (median, \$22; {IQR}, \$14, \$24). Among individual components, scan analysis and report claims (median, \$25; {IQR}, \$13, \$49) had the greatest {OPP}.

	abstract = {Background
Hypertension and coronary artery disease ({CAD}) are a prevalent combination in older women, however limited data are available to guide blood pressure ({BP}) management. We hypothesized that older women with hypertension and {CAD} may not derive long-term benefit by achieving systolic {BP} ({SBP}) {\textless} 130 {mmHg}.
Methods
We analyzed long-term all-cause mortality data from the International Verapamil {SR}/Trandolapril Study ({INVEST}), stratified by risk attributable to clinical severity of {CAD} (women with prior coronary events of myocardial infarction or revascularization considered high risk, all others at low risk) and by age group (50–64 or ≥65 years). The prognostic impact of achieving mean in-trial {SBP} {\textless}130 (referent group) was compared with 130–139 and ≥ 140 {mmHg} using Cox proportional hazards, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics.
Results
{SBPs} {\textless}130, 130–139, and ≥140 were achieved in 2960, 3024, and 3232 women, respectively. Among high-risk women aged ≥65 years, those achieving {SBP} 130–139 {mmHg} had lower mortality up to 16.7 years later than those with {SBP} {\textless}130 (hazard ratio [{HR}] 0.81, 95\% {CI} 0.69–0.96). High-risk women aged 50–64 achieving {SBP} 130–139 had a similar mortality risk as those with {SBP} {\textless}130 ({HR} 1.21, 95\% {CI} 0.87–1.68), while those achieving {SBP} ≥140 {mmHg} had a higher mortality risk than {SBP} {\textless} 130 ({HR} 1.92, 95\% {CI} 1.37–2.68). A similar pattern was observed among low-risk women ≥65 and {\textless}65 years old.
Conclusion
Among women ≥65 years old with hypertension and prior coronary events, in-trial {SBP} between 130 and 139 {mmHg} was associated with lower mortality over the long term versus {SBP} {\textless}130 {mmHg}.},

Personalizing antihypertensive therapy could improve blood pressure ({BP}) reduction. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of pragmatic implementation of a personalized plasma renin activity ({PRA})-based smartphone app on improving {BP} reduction. Patients with untreated or treated but uncontrolled {HTN} were recruited. {BP} and {PRA} were measured at baseline with final {BP} measured at 6 months.

Clinicians were at liberty to follow or disregard the app’s recommendations. {BP} levels and percent {BP} control among patients whose clinicians did and did not follow the app’s recommendations were compared using independent t-test and Fisher’s exact test, respectively. Twenty-nine European American patients were included (38\% women) with mean age of 52 ± 9 years and median {PRA} of 1.3 ng/{mL}/hr (interquartile range 0.5–3.1 ng/{mL}/hr). Participants whose clinicians followed the app’s recommendations (n = 16, 55\%) as compared with those whose clinicians did not (n = 13, 45\%), had a greater reduction in 6-month systolic {BP} (−15 ± 21 vs. −3 ± 21 mm Hg; adjusted-P = 0.1) and diastolic {BP} (−8 ± 8 vs. −1 ± 8 mm Hg; adjusted-P = 0.04). {BP} control at 6 months tended to be greater among patients whose clinicians accepted the app’s recommendations vs. those whose clinicians did not (63\% vs. 23\%, P = 0.06). This pilot study demonstrates that acceptance of the app’s recommendations was associated with a greater {BP} reduction. Future studies to confirm these pilot findings are warranted.},

	abstract = {Background Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ({NSAIDs}) have been associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events prompting labeling revisions cautioning their use among patients with cardiovascular disease ({CVD}). However, little is known regarding long-term trends in real-world prescribing of {NSAIDs} within the {CVD} population. We aimed to characterize the use of prescription {NSAIDs} among U.S. adults with {CVD} from 1988 to 2016. Methods We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cross-sectional data from 1988–1994 and 19992016 to identify participants aged greater than or equal to 18 years with hypertension (defined by self-report, mean blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, or antihypertensive medication use), or aged greater than or equal to 20 years with self-reported congestive heart failure ({CHF}), coronary heart disease ({CHD}), angina, myocardial infarction ({MI}), or stroke. Prevalence of prescription {NSAID} use was analyzed in 6-year examination periods. Weighted logistic regression was performed to test time trends in prescription {NSAID} use. Results Overall, prescription {NSAID} use declined among all {CVD} populations. The highest prevalence of overall prescription {NSAID} use was observed during the 1999–2004 examination years, thereafter declining through the 2005–2010 and 2011–2016 examination years: in patients with hypertension (13.9\% [1999–2004] to 8.5\% [2011–2016]), {CHF} (14.6\%–8.5\%), {CHD} (16.3\%–7.4\%), angina (17.6\%–8.5\%), {MI} (16.1\%–9.0\%), and stroke (15.7\%–7.9\%). Decreased use of {COX}-2-selective inhibitors was observed during the same period; whereas, nonselective {NSAID} use remained relatively stable. Trends in prescription {NSAID} use were reflective of the general adult population. Conclusions Prescription {NSAID} use among patients with {CVD} appears to have declined from 1988 to 2016, primarily due to reduced {COX}-2-selective inhibitor use. Nonetheless, the prevalence of prescription {NSAIDs} has persisted among a subset of high-risk {CVD} populations.},

	abstract = {Metabolic syndrome ({MetS}) is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Although the development of {MetS} is attributed to known lifestyle factors, perceived discrimination may also contribute to {MetS} development and severity.We examined the associations of perceived discrimination with {MetS} severity among African American adults at baseline and 8-year follow-up.Three thousand eight hundred and seventy participants (mean age 53.8 ± 13.0; 63.1\% female) without diabetes and no missing {MetS} severity scores at baseline were included. Each self-reported measure of discrimination at baseline (everyday, lifetime, and burden of lifetime) was classified into tertiles (low, medium, high). After adjustment for demographics and {MetS} risk factors, associations of discrimination were examined with a sex- and race/ethnicity-specific {MetS} severity Z-score. We employed a mixed model approach that allowed for the assessment of an overall association between reported discrimination at baseline and {MetS} severity, and for the possible change over time.Sex and age differences were observed in experiences with discrimination, such that men reported higher levels of all aspects of discrimination relative to women. Everyday discrimination decreased with age, whereas lifetime discrimination increased with age (p \&lt; .05). Independent of lifestyle and demographic factors, everyday and lifetime discrimination were significantly associated with {MetS} severity (p = .003 and p = .017, respectively) and the associations remained constant over the 8 years (i.e., no interaction with time).Our results suggest that, in a large community-based sample of African Americans, discrimination is a salient psychosocial risk factor for severity of {MetS}.},

Data Sources: A {MEDLINE}/{PubMed} search (January 2000 to January 2019) was conducted using the keywords erenumab-aooe, erenumab, migraine, migraine prophylaxis, migraine prevention, and chronic migraine. Additional articles were identified by hand from references. Study Selection and Data Extraction: We included English-language articles (excluding poster presentations) evaluating erenumab pharmacology, efficacy, or safety in humans for migraine prevention. Data Synthesis: Erenumab is a {CGRP} inhibitor that inhibits vasodilation in response to acute migraines, which decreases pain perception during the migraine. Erenumab efficacy and safety has only been compared with placebo, but its reduction in monthly migraine days ({MMDs}) and medication response (≥50\% reduction in {MMDs}) are comparable to current recommended off-label therapies for migraine prevention in short-term treatment studies. Additionally, erenumab is associated with low adverse event burden with no difference found compared with placebo per published clinical trials. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Erenumab is the first medication approved in the United States for the prevention of migraines in adults. No head-to-head data are available, but existing data suggest that erenumab is at least as effective as current off-label products and with reduced adverse effects. Conclusion: Erenumab is an effective once-monthly injectable agent for migraine prevention in patients with chronic or episodic migraine. It is also effective for patients who have previously failed migraine preventive therapy. Erenumab has a favorable adverse effect profile, which may improve patient adherence.},

The date of first the {ABPM} claim was used as the index date. Per-beneficiary {ABPM} episode reimbursements were calculated by aggregating all {ABPM}-related reimbursements within a 30-day post-index window, considered as an {ABPM} episode. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of successful reimbursement. Of 20 875 beneficiaries with {ABPM} claims, 16 920 (81.0\%) were reimbursed. The median reimbursement per beneficiary for an {ABPM} episode was \$89 (Inter Quartile Range [{IQR}], \$62, \$132), driven primarily by reimbursement for the full procedure (median, \$86; {IQR}, \$66, \$110).

	abstract = {Background: Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease ({CAD}), the main cause of death in women. While association between the two is frequent, limited data exist regarding the feasibility of blood pressure ({BP}) management and outcomes in women across the spectrum of {CAD}. Accordingly, we analyzed patient characteristics, {BP} control rates, and outcomes among hypertensive women with {CAD}, enrolled in The {INternational} {VErapamil} {SR}-trandolapril {STudy} ({INVEST}).

Methods: The 11,770 hypertensive women with {CAD} in {INVEST} were studied based on presence (n = 3,879) or absence (n = 7,891) of history of myocardial infarction ({MI}) or coronary revascularization, to evaluate outcomes across risk groups based on severity of {CAD}.

Results: Women with prior {MI} or revascularization were older (4 years, p {\textless} 0.0001), were predominantly white (62\% vs. 29\%), and had more associated comorbidities than women without these events. At 24 months, {JNC} {VI} (sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure) {BP} control rates were lower in women with prior {MI} or revascularization (57\% vs. 64\%, p {\textless} 0.0001), despite more intensive antihypertensive therapy. The primary outcome (first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal {MI}, or nonfatal stroke) was also more frequent in women with prior {MI} or revascularization (adjusted hazard ratio [{HR}] 1.53, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.34–1.74), who were 42\% more likely to die (adjusted {HR} 1.42; 95\% {CI} 1.22–1.64), twice as likely to have a nonfatal {MI} (adjusted {HR} 2.4, 95\% {CI} 1.64–3.51), and 56\% more likely to have a nonfatal stroke (adjusted {HR} 1.56, 95\% {CI} 1.1–2.21).

Conclusions: In a prospective, multinational cohort of hypertensive women with {CAD}, those with prior {MI} or revascularization comprised a group at higher risk for death, nonfatal {MI}, and nonfatal stroke, and were less likely to have their {BP} controlled, despite more aggressive therapy. The feasibility and benefit of reducing {BP} to {\textless}130/80 {mmHg} in women, particularly with more severe {CAD}, warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {Background: Computable phenotypes have the ability to utilize data within the electronic health record ({EHR}) to identify patients with certain characteristics. Many computable phenotypes rely on multiple types of data within the {EHR} including prescription drug information. Hypertension ({HTN})-related computable phenotypes are particularly dependent on the correct classification of antihypertensive prescription drug information, as well as corresponding diagnoses and blood pressure information.
Objective: This study aimed to create an antihypertensive drug classification system to be utilized with {EHR}-based data as part of {HTN}-related computable phenotypes.
Methods: We compared 4 different antihypertensive drug classification systems based off of 4 different methodologies and terminologies, including 3 {RxNorm} Concept Unique Identifier ({RxCUI})–based classifications and 1 medication name–based classification. The {RxCUI}-based classifications utilized data from (1) the Drug Ontology, (2) the new Medication Reference Terminology, and (3) the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System and {DrugBank}, whereas the medication name–based classification relied on antihypertensive drug names. Each classification system was applied to {EHR}-based prescription drug data from hypertensive patients in the {OneFlorida} Data Trust.
Results: There were 13,627 unique {RxCUIs} and 8025 unique medication names from the 13,879,046 prescriptions. We observed a broad overlap between the 4 methods, with 84.1\% (691/822) to 95.3\% (695/729) of terms overlapping pairwise between the different classification methods. Key differences arose from drug products with multiple dosage forms, drug products with an indication of benign prostatic hyperplasia, drug products that contain more than 1 ingredient (combination products), and terms within the classification systems corresponding to retired or obsolete {RxCUIs}.
Conclusions: In total, 2 antihypertensive drug classifications were constructed, one based on {RxCUIs} and one based on medication name, that can be used in future computable phenotypes that require antihypertensive drug classifications.},

This study directly compared {ACEis} and {ARBs} on associations with risk of mobility disability in older adults when combined with a physical activity intervention.This was a secondary analysis of the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders ({LIFE}) trial. Participants aged 70–89 years were randomized to a physical activity or health education intervention. Outcomes included incident and persistent major mobility disability, injurious falls, short physical performance battery, and gait speed. For this analysis, only participants who reported {ACEi} or {ARB} use at baseline were included. Baseline differences between {ACEi} and {ARB} groups were adjusted for using inverse probability of treatment weights. Weighted Cox proportional hazard models and analysis of covariance models were used to evaluate the independent effects of medications and interaction effects with the intervention on each outcome.Of 1,635 participants in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders study, 796 used either an {ACEi} (496, 62.3\%) or {ARB} (300, 37.7\%). Compared with {ACEi} users, {ARB} users had 28\% lower risk (hazard ratio [{HR}] = 0.72 [0.60–0.85]) of incident major mobility disability and 35\% ({HR} = 0.65 [0.52–0.82]) lower risk of persistent major mobility disability whereas no interaction between medication use and intervention was observed. Risk of injurious falls and changes in short physical performance battery or gait speed were not different between {ARB} and {ACEi} users.These results suggest that {ARBs} may protect from major mobility disability by other mechanisms than improving physical performance.},

	abstract = {Objective: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of the factor Xa ({FXa}) inhibitor betrixaban for extended-duration prophylaxis of acute medically ill patients with venous thromboembolism ({VTE}) risk factors. Data Sources: A {MEDLINE}/{PubMed} (January 1990 to October 2017) search was conducted using the following keywords: betrixaban, {PRT}054021, {FXa} inhibitor, novel oral anticoagulant, {NOAC}, direct oral anticoagulant, {DOAC}, and target specific oral anticoagulant, {TSOAC}. References of identified articles were searched by hand for additional relevant citations. Study Selection and Data Extraction: We included English-language articles evaluating betrixaban pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety in human subjects for {VTE} prophylaxis. Data Synthesis: Betrixaban is a {FXa} inhibitor that decreases prothrombinase activity and thrombin generation. Betrixaban efficacy and safety has been compared with that of enoxaparin for prophylaxis of {VTE} in acutely ill medical patients. In the {APEX} trial and substudies, extended-duration betrixaban was superior in efficacy to standard-duration enoxaparin in patients at high risk for {VTE}, including those with elevated D-dimer levels (≥2? upper limit of normal) and of older age (≥75 years). Betrixaban is noninferior to enoxaparin in rates of major bleeding, but the former is associated with more clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events. Conclusion: Betrixaban is the first oral agent approved for extended-duration {VTE} prophylaxis in acutely ill hospitalized patients. Extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with betrixaban reduces the risk of {VTE} compared with standard-duration thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin but is associated with increased risk of bleeding.},

The previously validated {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 score (considering sex, age, medical history, treatment, tobacco, and race) predicts anticoagulation control during standard follow-up (every 4 weeks), with lower scores associated with greater time in therapeutic range. Objective: To evaluate the ability of the {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 score in predicting success with extended-interval warfarin follow-up in patients with previously stable warfarin doses. Methods: In this post hoc analysis of a single-arm feasibility study, baseline {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 scores were calculated for patients with ≥1 extended-interval follow-up visit. The primary analysis assessed achieved weeks of extended-interval follow-up according to baseline {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 scores. Results: A total of 47 patients receiving chronic anticoagulation completed a median of 36 weeks of extended-interval follow-up. The median baseline {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 score was 1 (range 0-5). Lower {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 scores appeared to be associated with greater duration of extended-interval follow-up achieved, though the differences between scores were not statistically significant. No individual variable of the {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 score was associated with achieved weeks of extended-interval follow-up. Analysis of additional patient factors found that longer duration (≥24 weeks) of prior stable treatment was significantly associated with greater weeks of extended-interval follow-up completed (P = 0.04). Conclusion and Relevance: This pilot study provides limited evidence that the {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 score predicts success with extended-interval warfarin follow-up but requires confirmation in a larger study. Further research is also necessary to establish additional predictors of successful extended-interval warfarin follow-up.},

	abstract = {Resistant hypertension ({RH}) is defined as above-goal elevated blood pressure ({BP}) in a patient despite the concurrent use of 3 antihypertensive drug classes, commonly including a long-acting calcium channel blocker, a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker), and a diuretic. The antihypertensive drugs should be administered at maximum or maximally tolerated daily doses. {RH} also includes patients whose {BP} achieves target values on ≥4 antihypertensive medications. The diagnosis of {RH} requires assurance of antihypertensive medication adherence and exclusion of the “white-coat effect” (office {BP} above goal but out-of-office {BP} at or below target). The importance of {RH} is underscored by the associated risk of adverse outcomes compared with non-{RH}. This article is an updated American Heart Association scientific statement on the detection, evaluation, and management of {RH}. Once antihypertensive medication adherence is confirmed and out-of-office {BP} recordings exclude a white-coat effect, evaluation includes identification of contributing lifestyle issues, detection of drugs interfering with antihypertensive medication effectiveness, screening for secondary hypertension, and assessment of target organ damage. Management of {RH} includes maximization of lifestyle interventions, use of long-acting thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone or indapamide), addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone), and, if {BP} remains elevated, stepwise addition of antihypertensive drugs with complementary mechanisms of action to lower {BP}.

	abstract = {Background
Prior studies suggest benefits of blood pressure lowering on cardiovascular risk may be attenuated in patients with resistant hypertension compared with the general hypertensive population, but prospective data are lacking.
Methods
We assessed intensive ({\textless}120 mm Hg) versus standard ({\textless}140 mm Hg) systolic blood pressure targets on adverse outcome risk according to baseline resistant hypertension status, using Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ({ACCORD}) and Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial ({SPRINT}) patient-level data. Patients were categorized as having baseline apparent resistant hypertension (blood pressure ≥130/80 mm Hg while using 3 antihypertensive drugs or use of ≥4 drugs regardless of blood pressure) or non-resistant hypertension (all others). Cox regression was used to assess effects of treatment assignment, resistant hypertension status, their interaction, and other covariates, on first occurrence of 2 outcomes: myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death ± heart failure, and the same outcomes plus all-cause death, individually.
Results
Among 14,094 patients, 2710 (19.2\%) had baseline apparent resistant hypertension. In adjusted models, an intensive target reduced risk of both outcomes (myocardial infarction/stroke/cardiovascular death: hazard ratio [{HR}], 0.81; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.71-0.93; myocardial infarction/stroke/heart failure/cardiovascular death: {HR} 0.78; 95\% {CI}, 0.69-0.88) as well as stroke ({HR} 0.72; 95\% {CI}, 0.55-0.94) and heart failure ({HR} 0.73; 95\% {CI}, 0.59-0.91). An intensive target also appeared to reduce myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death risk. Benefits were observed irrespective of baseline resistant hypertension status.
Conclusions
Our findings provide the first evidence to support guidance to treat resistant hypertension to the same blood pressure goal as non-resistant hypertension.},

Results In fully adjusted models, use of {SGLT}2 inhibitors was associated with a decreased risk of developing {CVD} compared with use of sulfonylureas ({HR}, 0.50; 95\% {CI}, 0.45, 0.55) and {DPP}-4 inhibitors ({HR}, 0.57; 95\% {CI}, 0.52, 0.62), respectively. Analyses revealed no evidence of within-class effects: dapagliflozin vs sulfonylureas ({HR}, 0.55; 95\% {CI}, 0.43, 0.70) or {DPP}-4 inhibitors ({HR}, 0.57; 95\% {CI}, 0.46, 0.70); and canagliflozin vs sulfonylureas ({HR}, 0.61; 95\% {CI}, 0.54, 0.69) or {DPP}-4 inhibitors ({HR}, 0.66; 95\% {CI}, 0.54, 0.71). Additionally, {SGLT}2 inhibitors were associated with lower risk of hospitalization because of heart failure compared to both sulfonylureas and {DPP}-4 inhibitors, as well as lower risk of lower extremity amputation compared to sulfonylureas. Conclusion Using population-based data, incident use of {SGLT}-2 inhibitors was associated with a decreased incidence of {CVD} compared to use of sulfonylureas and {DPP}-4 inhibitors. These findings were consistent between dapagliflozin and canagliflozin, suggesting that {CVD} reduction is a class effect for {SGLT}2 inhibitors. In addition, {SGLT}2 inhibitors portended lower risk of hospitalization because of heart failure (vs sulfonylureas and {DPP}-4 inhibitors) and lower risk of lower extremity amputation (vs sulfonylureas).},

Overall, 5702 and 6082 patients were included in the intensive and standard treatment cohorts, respectively. Crude {TRH} incidence using the updated definition under intensive treatment was 30.3 (95\% {CI}, 29.3-31.4) per 100 patient-years, compared with 9.7 (95\% {CI}, 9.2-10.2) using the prior definition under standard treatment.

        A goal {SBP} 120 {mmHg} or less reduced mortality in high-risk Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial patients; however, mortality implications of concomitant {DBP} lowering in coronary artery disease ({CAD}) are uncertain. We examined the relationship between {DBP} lowering and all-cause mortality with lower achieved {SBPs} in a large cohort.
        Methods: 
        We categorized 17 131 hypertensive patients from the {INternational} {VErapamil}-trandolapril {STudy} {US} cohort, aged at least 50 years with {CAD}, by mean achieved {SBP} ({\textless}120, 120 to {\textless}130, 130 to {\textless}140, and ≥140 {mmHg}) and {DBP} tertiles (low, middle, and high per {SBP} category) during active follow-up. Long-term mortality was determined via National Death Index. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to investigate the impact of {DBP} lowering among all {SBP} categories and within each {SBP} category.
        Results: 
        There were 6031 deaths over mean follow-up of 11.6 years (198 352 patient-years). In unadjusted analyses, achieving {DBP} in the lowest tertile portended greatest mortality risk across all {SBP} categories. In multivariate analysis, using {SBP} 120 to less than 130 {mmHg}, {DBP} at least 79 {mmHg} as reference (mortality nadir), achieving {DBP} in the lowest tertile ({DBP} {\textless} 69 {mmHg}) was associated with excess mortality risk among those with {SBP} less than 120 {mmHg} (adjusted hazard ratio 1.60; 95\% confidence interval, 1.33–1.91). However, among those with {SBP} 120 to less than 140 {mmHg}, adjusted mortality risk did not differ significantly with low {DBPs}. Among those with {SBP} at least 140 {mmHg}, mortality risk remained high regardless of {DBP}.
        Conclusion: 
        In older {CAD} patients, the mortality risk related to excess {DBP} lowering is accentuated in those achieving intensive {SBP} control less than 120 {mmHg}, raising concerns about intensive {SBP} lowering in these patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Women are at greater risk of developing resistant hypertension ({RH}) than men, yet scarce data exist on {RH}-associated outcomes in women. We aimed to determine all-cause mortality risk associated with apparent {RH} ({aRH}) among women across the spectrum of underlying coronary disease.

Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from St. James Women Take Heart ({WTH}; women without coronary disease at baseline), Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (women with signs/symptoms of ischemia at baseline), and the {INternational} {VErapamil}-Trandolapril {STudy} ({INVEST}; women with coronary artery disease and hypertension at baseline), totaling 15,108 adult women with no hypertension, non-{RH} (blood pressure [{BP}] ≥140/90 {mmHg} on ≤2 drugs or {BP} {\textless}140/90 {mmHg} on 1–3 drugs), or {aRH} ({BP} ≥140/90 {mmHg} on ≥3 drugs or anyone on ≥4 drugs) at baseline. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.

Results: Prevalence of {aRH} ranged from 0.4\% ({WTH}) to 10.6\% ({INVEST}). Women with {aRH}, compared to those without, were older, more often black, and more likely to be obese or diabetic. Pooling all cohorts, risk for all-cause death was greater in women with {aRH} than in women with non-{RH} (adjusted {HR} 1.40; 95\% {CI} 1.27–1.55) and women without hypertension (adjusted {HR} 2.34; 95\% {CI} 1.76–3.11) over a median follow-up of 14.3 years.

Conclusions: {aRH} prevalence in women varies according to underlying coronary disease, and {aRH} is associated with a substantial, early, and sustained increased risk of all-cause death. Additional research into early recognition and prevention strategies for {RH} are needed, especially in black and older women, and those with known cardiovascular risk factors.},

We aimed to make an initial assessment of anticoagulation satisfaction before and after an extended-interval warfarin monitoring intervention. We conducted a translational prospective single-arm pilot study of extended-interval warfarin monitoring in five pharmacist-managed anticoagulation clinics. Patients meeting {CHEST} guideline criteria for extended-interval warfarin monitoring began progressive extended-interval follow-up (6, 8, and 12 weeks thereafter). The Duke Anticoagulation Satisfaction Scale ({DASS}) was administered at baseline and at end-of-study or study removal (in patients no longer appropriate for extended interval follow-up). Forty-six patients had evaluable pre- and post-intervention {DASS} survey data. Mean age of patients was 66.5 years, 74 \% were non-Hispanic whites, and 48 \% were men. Patients completed a mean ± {SD} of 34 ± 22 weeks of follow-up. Mean ± {SD} total {DASS} score at baseline was 45.2 ± 14.2 versus 49.1 ± 14.9 at end-of-study (mean change, +3.9 [95 \% {CI} −0.6–8.4; p = 0.09]), indicating no benefit—and trending toward decrement—to anticoagulation satisfaction. Change in anticoagulation satisfaction varied substantially following extended-interval monitoring, with no evidence of improved satisfaction. Plausible reasons for patients not preferring extended-interval monitoring include increased anxiety and disengagement from self-management activities, both potentially related to less frequent feedback and reassurance during extended interval-monitoring. Additional research is needed to identify who is likely to benefit most from extended-interval monitoring. Anticoagulation satisfaction should be considered with clinical factors and shared-decision making when implementing extended-interval warfarin monitoring.},

	abstract = {Little is known of {US} trends in antihypertensive drug use for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension ({TRH}). We analyzed antihypertensive use among patients with {TRH} (treated with ≥4 antihypertensive drugs concurrently) from July 2008 through December 2014 using Marketscan administrative data. We included adults aged 18 to 65 years, with ≥6 months of continuous enrollment, a hypertension diagnosis, and ≥1 episode of overlapping use of ≥4 antihypertensive drugs; patients with heart failure were excluded. We identified 411 652 unique {TRH} episodes from 261 652 patients with a mean age of 55.9 years. From 2008 to 2014, we observed an increased prevalence, among {TRH} episodes, of β-blockers (+6.8\% [79\% to 85.8\%]) and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (+8.1\% [69.1\% to 77.2\%]), and a decreased prevalence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (−12.5\% [60.4\% to 47.9\%]) and nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists (−5.0\% [15\% to 10\%]). The prevalence of most other classes changed by {\textless}5\% from 2008 to 2014. Thiazide diuretic use was largely unchanged from 2008 to 2014, with hydrochlorothiazide being by far the most prevalent thiazide diuretic; chlorthalidone use increased only modestly (+2.6\% [3.8\% to 6.4\%]). Aldosterone antagonist use increased only modestly (+2.9\% [7.3\% to 10.2\%]). Use of optimal regimens increased steadily (+13.8\% [50.8\% to 64.6\%]) during the study period, whereas combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use declined (−11.4\% [17.7\% to 6.3\%]). Our results highlight the persistent infrequent use of recommended therapies in {TRH}, including spironolactone and chlorthalidone, and suggest a need for better efforts to increase the use of such approaches in light of recent evidence demonstrating their efficacy.},

	abstract = {Objective: 
        Resistant hypertension (res-{HTN}) is a challenging problem, but little is known of res-{HTN} in patients with coronary artery disease ({CAD}). In this post-hoc {INternational} {VErapamil} {SR}-Trandolapril {STudy} ({INVEST}) analysis, we assessed prevalence, predictors, and impact on outcomes of res-{HTN} in {CAD} patients with hypertension.
        Methods: 
        Participants (n = 17 190) were divided into three groups according to achieved blood pressure ({BP}): controlled ({BP} {\textless}140/90 {mmHg} on three or fewer drugs); uncontrolled ({BP} ≥140/90 {mmHg} on two or fewer drugs); or resistant ({BP} ≥140/90 {mmHg} on three drugs or any patient on at least four drugs).
        Results: 
        The prevalence of res-{HTN} was 38\%: significant predictors of res-{HTN} included heart failure [odds ratio ({OR}) 1.73], diabetes ({OR} 1.63), Black race ({OR} 1.50), and {US} residence ({OR} 1.50). Compared with controlled {HTN}, res-{HTN} had multivariate-adjusted association with higher risk of adverse outcomes \{first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke [hazard ratio 1.27, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.13–1.43], and individual outcomes of all-cause death (hazard ratio 1.29, 95\% {CI} 1.13–1.48), cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.47, 95\% {CI} 1.21–1.78), and nonfatal stroke (hazard ratio 1.61, 95\% {CI} 1.17–2.22), but not nonfatal myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 0.98, 95\% {CI} 0.72–1.34)\}. Adverse outcomes, except nonfatal stroke, did not differ in patients with res-{HTN} compared to uncontrolled {HTN}.
        Conclusions: 
        Res-{HTN} is common in patients with {CAD} and hypertension, associated with poor prognosis, and linked with a number of conditions. Emphasis should be placed on recognizing those at risk for res-{HTN} and future studies should examine whether more aggressive treatment of res-{HTN} improves outcomes.},

	abstract = {What is known and objective Fibromyalgia is a painful disease affecting 1–2\% of the United States population. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ({SNRIs}), such as duloxetine and milnacipran, are well studied and frequently used for treating this disorder. However, efficacy data are limited for the {SNRI} venlafaxine despite its use in nearly a quarter of patients with fibromyalgia. Accordingly, we systematically reviewed the efficacy of venlafaxine for treatment of fibromyalgia. Methods {PubMed}, Web of Science and the Cochrane Database were searched using the terms ‘venlafaxine’ and ‘fibromyalgia’. Results were classified as primary studies or review articles based on abstract review. References of review articles were evaluated to ensure no primary studies evaluating venlafaxine were overlooked. All clinical studies that investigated venlafaxine for the treatment of fibromyalgia were included and graded on strength of evidence. Results and discussion Five studies met the inclusion criteria, including 4 open-label cohort studies and 1 randomized, controlled trial. Study durations ranged from 6 weeks to 6 months, and study sizes ranged from 11 to 102 participants. Four of the five published studies reported improvement in at least one outcome. Generally consistent improvements were observed in pain-related outcome measures, including the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (range, 26–29\% reduction; n = 2 studies), Visual Analog Scale (range, 36–45\% reduction; n = 2 studies), {McGill} Pain Questionnaire (48\% reduction; n = 1 study) and Clinical Global Impression scale (51\% had significant score change; n = 1 study). However, the few studies identified were limited by small sample size, inconsistent use of outcomes and methodological concerns. What is new and conclusion Studies assessing the efficacy of venlafaxine in the treatment of fibromyalgia to date have been limited by small sample size, inconsistent venlafaxine dosing, lack of placebo control and lack of blinding. In the context of these limitations, venlafaxine appears to be at least modestly effective in treating fibromyalgia. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate the full benefit of venlafaxine.},

In patients with uncomplicated hypertension, home blood pressure ({BP}) monitoring combined with medication self-titration has been shown to substantially reduce {BP}.1 It is unknown whether a similar intervention is effective in high-risk patients with hypertension.

Patients (n=555) aged ≥35 years with a {BP} ≥130/80 mm Hg, but ≤180/100 mm Hg (treated with 0–3 antihypertensive drugs) and ≥1 high-risk condition were randomly assigned to home {BP} monitoring with patient-initiated drug titration (intervention arm) or standard care.

	abstract = {Aims The 2012 American College of Chest Physician Evidence-Based Management of Anticoagulant Therapy guidelines suggest an international normalized ratio ({INR}) testing interval of up to 12 weeks, rather than every 4 weeks, for patients with consistently stable {INRs} while taking vitamin K antagonists. We aimed to examine the feasibility of extended-interval follow-up in a real-world setting. Methods Patients receiving stable warfarin therapy for ≥12 weeks at baseline began extended-interval follow-up with visits occurring at 6 weeks, 14 weeks, and every 12 weeks thereafter to a maximum of 68 weeks or until they were no longer suitable for extended-interval follow-up. A single {INR} excursion {\textgreater}0.3 from goal was permitted if a reversible precipitating factor was identified and the {INR} was expected to return to goal without dose adjustment. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients completing all study follow-up visits. Results Of 48 patients enrolled, 47 had evaluable data. The most common indication for anticoagulation was atrial fibrillation/flutter (53.2\%). At baseline, mean prior warfarin treatment duration was 6.7 ± 6 years and median number of weeks on a stable regimen was 24 weeks ({IQR}, 19–37.5). Eleven patients (23\%) completed all study follow-up visits, whereas 17 (36\%) did not maintain a stable {INR} past the 14-week follow-up. Conclusion A large proportion of patients with previously stable (≥3 months) {INRs} were not able to maintain stable {INRs} during extended-interval follow-up.

Recent evidence, although limited, suggests that {TRH} may also adversely affect health-related quality of life ({HrQoL}) and other patient-reported outcomes. However, the precise mechanisms for this link remain unknown. A number of recent studies focusing on both the general hypertensive population and those with {TRH} suggest that patient awareness of difficult-to-control blood pressure, chronically elevated blood pressure levels, and the use of aggressive medication regimens with attendant cumulative adverse effects may play significant roles.

	abstract = {The primary objective of this study was to determine whether warfarin therapy monitoring by a pharmacist would benefit a long-term care facility, by maintaining patients within therapeutic {INR} range more consistently than the current practice of physician monitoring.Secondary objectives included whether adverse events resulting from non-therapeutic {INR} levels differed significantly between groups and whether pharmacist interventions resulted in decreased overall costs to the facility. A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients treated with warfarin for a minimum of 14 days within a Long-Term Care ({LTC}) facility to compare Time within Therapeutic Range ({TTR}) between staff treated patients versus pharmacist treated patients. A total of 552 {INRs} were obtained for all patients during the study period: 499 (90.4\%) under staff supervision and 53 (9.6\%) under clinical pharmacist supervision. Of the 499 tests performed by the River Garden staff, 203 were within the desired range, compared with 29 of the 53 tests performed by the clinical pharmacist being in range. For the primary endpoint, a total of 1483 {INRs} were imputed, corresponding to the number of days between true {INR} measurements. {INRs} attributable to clinic staff management were within the therapeutic range 47.1\% of the time, whereas {INRs} attributable to clinical pharmacist management were within the therapeutic range 58.7\% of the time (P {\textless} 0.0001 for the comparison). Warfarin can be effectively monitored by a clinical pharmacist and routinely lead to appropriate {INR} levels in the nursing home setting, while potentially saving the facility healthcare dollars.},

We aimed to determine whether {AMEs} are correlated with {BP} response in uncomplicated hypertensives.In a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group trial, we enrolled 569 persons, aged 17–65, with random assignment to 9 weeks of daily hydrochlorothiazide ({HCTZ}) or atenolol monotherapy, followed by 9 weeks of add-on therapy with the alternate agent. Measurements included home {BP}, averaged over 1 week, weight and fasting levels of serum glucose, low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}), high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}), triglycerides, and uric acid ({UA}) before and after monotherapy and after add-on therapy.Increases in {UA} correlated with reductions in systolic {BP} ({SBP}) (r = −0.18; P = 0.003) and diastolic {BP} ({DBP}) (r = −0.20; P = 0.001) following {HCTZ} monotherapy and add-on therapy (r = −0.27 and r = −0.21, respectively; both P \&lt; 0.001). After adjustment for age, race, gender, and baseline body mass index ({BMI}), only the correlation between {UA} and {DBP} response became nonsignificant. Reductions in {HDL} correlated with systolic response following atenolol monotherapy (r = 0.18; P = 0.002) and with systolic and diastolic response following add-on therapy (r = 0.30 and r = 0.24, respectively; both P \&lt; 0.0001). These correlations remained significant after covariate adjustment. {BP} responses were not correlated with changes in glucose, {LDL}, triglycerides, or weight following either therapy.{BP} response correlated with changes in {UA} following {HCTZ} therapy and {HDL} following atenolol therapy. No other significant correlations were observed between {BP} response and {AMEs}, suggesting that these effects generally do not share predictors.

To describe a potential future role of the community pharmacist in public health using virtual centers that provide immediate feedback to patients regarding behavior changes.
Summary
Community pharmacists would provide a comprehensive standardized patient-centered interview to collect pertinent information regarding patients that, together with a computerized body scan of the individual, would be fed into the virtual center to create a baseline likeness of the person. The virtual center then would predict the person's appearance and overall body health at a predetermined interval in the future, as well as provide feedback to the patient, engaging multiple senses and using an advanced body suit to represent changes in body mass and exercise tolerance as the person moves in the center. Pharmacists would work with the patient to identify patient-centered behavior changes, which would be programmed into the virtual center to demonstrate to the person how their new lifestyle goal may change their future appearance and health. Achievements and social networking in the virtual world would be incorporated to motivate patients to continue to make positive decisions regarding their health.
Conclusion
Virtual reality technology can be a powerful motivational tool that community pharmacists can use in a variety of ways to help patients implement and sustain positive lifestyle changes.},

	abstract = {Aims
The purpose of this study was to determine the difference in diabetes-related medication expenditures as a result of a 16-week lifestyle intervention program. Medical expenditures for patients with diabetes are twice as high compared to patients without this condition. Secondary objectives were changes in {HbA}1C, {BMI}, weight, body fat, and program satisfaction.
Methods
The Wellness Life! Program includes educational sessions focused on nutrition, fitness, and behavioral therapy. Medication costs were based on Average Wholesale Prices, tabulated from the 2010 Red Book.
Results
A total of 36 patients (49–80 years old) enrolled, of which 27 patients have diabetes mellitus (Type 2=26, Type 1=1). Mean 30-day anti-diabetic medication costs decreased by \$142.92. Clinical mean parameters improved in both the overall group and the diabetic subgroup, respectively: {HbA}1C (\%) −0.69, −0.82; weight (lbs) −16.94, −17.11; {BMI} −2.73, −2.88; and body fat (\%) −1.71, −1.79. Participants were generally satisfied with the program.
Conclusions
Employing a multidisciplinary wellness program within an endocrinology practice can reduce anti-diabetic medication expenses; however, long term follow-up is needed to determine if medication reductions and improved clinical parameters persist.},

With this increased attention has come a considerably better understanding of disease epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment, yet much remains unknown. Current data suggest that the prevalence of resistant hypertension has been increasing in recent decades, a concerning finding given that resistant hypertension appears to be associated with a poorer prognosis than nonresistant hypertension. The most appropriate management for these patients has not been fully elucidated, but a multifaceted approach incorporating accurate diagnosis, identification, and removal of substances that interfere with blood pressure, dietary and lifestyle management, and treatment with rational drug combination therapy can be quite effective in controlling blood pressure in these patients. Newer therapies, both pharmacologic and interventional procedures, are under study and may hold promise in the future treatment of resistant hypertension.

Univariate sensitivity analyses demonstrated that results were most sensitive to varying the treatment effect of {PRA}-guided therapy and the cost of the {PRA} test.Our results suggest that {PRA}-guided therapy compared with standard care increases {QALYs} and medical costs in most scenarios. {PRA}-guided therapy appears to be most cost effective in younger persons and those with more cardiovascular risk factors.},

	abstract = {Background

Women are more likely than men to develop resistant hypertension, which is associated with excess risk of major adverse outcomes; however, the impact of resistant hypertension in women with ischemia has not been explicitly studied. In this Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation ({WISE}) analysis, we assessed long‐term adverse outcomes associated with apparent treatment‐resistant hypertension ({aTRH}) among women with suspected myocardial ischemia referred for coronary angiography.

Methods and Results

Women (n=927) were grouped according to baseline blood pressure ({BP}): normotensive (no hypertension history, {BP} {\textless}140/90 mm Hg, no antihypertensive drugs); controlled ({BP} {\textless}140/90 mm Hg and a hypertension diagnosis or on 1 to 3 drugs); uncontrolled ({BP} ≥140/90 mm Hg on ≤2 drugs); or {aTRH} ({BP} ≥140/90 mm Hg on 3 drugs or anyone on ≥4 drugs). Adverse outcomes (first occurrence of death [any cause], nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure or angina) were collected over 10 years of follow‐up. Apparent treatment‐resistant hypertension prevalence was 10.4\% among those with hypertension. Women with {aTRH} had a greater incidence of adverse outcomes, compared with normotensive women (adjusted hazard ratio [{HR}], 3.25; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.94 to 5.43), and women with controlled ({HR}, 1.77; 95\% {CI}, 1.26 to 2.49) and uncontrolled ({HR}, 1.62; 95\% {CI}, 1.15 to 2.27) hypertension; outcome differences were evident early in follow‐up. Risk of all‐cause death was greater in the {aTRH} group, compared to the normotensive women and women with controlled and uncontrolled hypertension.

Conclusions

In this cohort of women with evidence of ischemia, {aTRH} was associated with a profoundly increased long‐term risk of major adverse events, including death, that emerged early during follow‐up.},

We prospectively examined peripheral {BP}, central aortic {BP}, and arterial wall properties and wave reflection in 57 subjects with uncomplicated essential hypertension in the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses ({PEAR}) Study. Significant predictors of central {SBP} included height, smoking status, heart rate ({HR}), and peripheral systolic {BP} ({SBP}), while central diastolic {BP} ({DBP}) was explained by peripheral {DBP} and {HR}. These variables accounted for nearly all of the variability in central {SBP} and central {DBP} (R2 = 0.94 and R2 = 0.98, respectively). Central pulse pressure variability was largely explained by gender, ex-smoking status, {HR}, peripheral {SBP}, and peripheral {DBP} (R2 = 0.94). Central augmented pressure had a direct relationship with smoking status, peripheral {SBP}, and duration of hypertension, whereas it was indirectly related to height, {HR}, and peripheral {DBP}. Easily obtainable demographic and clinical factors are associated with central pressures in essential hypertensive persons. These relationships should be considered in future studies to improve assessment of {BP} to reduce cardiovascular risk and mortality.},

	abstract = {The renin–angiotensin system ({RAS}) is a prime target for cardiovascular drug therapy. Inhibition of the {RAS} lowers blood pressure and confers protection against cardiovascular and renal events. These latter benefits cannot be entirely attributed to blood pressure lowering. Angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE})-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ({ARBs}) have been studied extensively and, while there is irrefutable evidence that these agents mitigate the risk for cardiovascular and renal events, their protection is incomplete. In outcomes studies that have employed {ACE}-inhibitors or {ARBs} there has been a relatively high residual event rate in the treatment arm and this has been ascribed, by some, to the fact that neither {ACE}-inhibitors nor {ARBs} completely repress {RAS}. For this reason, combined {RAS} blockade with an {ACE}-inhibitor and {ARB} has emerged as a therapeutic option. In hypertension, combined {RAS} blockade elicits only a marginal incremental drop in blood pressure and it does not further lower the risk for cardiovascular events. In chronic heart failure and proteinuric renal disease, combining these agents in carefully selected patients is associated with a reduction in clinical events. Irrespective of the setting, dual {RAS} blockade is associated with an increase in the risk for adverse events, primarily hyperkalemia and worsening renal function. The emergence of the direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, has afforded clinicians a new strategy for {RAS} blockade. Renin system blockade with aliskiren plus another {RAS} agent is the subject of ongoing large-scale clinical trials and early studies suggest promise for this strategy. Currently, combined {RAS} blockade with an {ACE}-inhibitor and an {ARB} should not be routinely employed for hypertension; however, the combination of an {ACE}-inhibitor or {ARB} with aliskiren might be considered in some patients given the more formidable blood pressure-lowering profile of this regimen. In carefully selected patients with heart failure or kidney disease, combination therapy with two {RAS} inhibitors should be considered.},

Patients. Community-based ambulatory population of 202 patients (age range 17–65 yrs) with a new diagnosis of hypertension, untreated hypertension, or known hypertension, who were previously treated with fewer than three antihypertensive drugs and had no evidence of cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus. Intervention. Monotherapy with oral hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 or 25 mg/day for 9 weeks. Measurements and Main Results. Fasting serum glucose, serum potassium, and plasma insulin levels were obtained at baseline (before hydrochlorothiazide therapy was started) and after 9 weeks of therapy. Significant elevations were noted in fasting serum glucose (mean ± {SD} 3.42 ± 10.38 mg/dl, p{\textless}0.0001) and plasma insulin (2.35 ± 9.47 μ{lU}/ml, p{\textless}0.0001) levels, and a significant reduction in serum potassium level (0.30 ± 0.44 {mEq}/L, p{\textless}00.0001) was noted.
