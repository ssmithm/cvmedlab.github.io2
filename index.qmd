### [Background]{style="color: #1E354B"}

I am a pharmacist and epidemiologist specializing in cardiovascular medicine, especially hypertension. I obtained my PharmD in 2007 and MPH, with an emphasis in biostatistics and epidemiology in 2011, both from the University of Florida. I completed a Pharmacy Practice Residency at the NF/SG Veterans Affairs Hospital (2008) and a postdoctoral fellowship in Family Medicine at the University of Florida (2011). I started my career at the University of Colorado in 2011 and returned to the University of Florida in 2014.
